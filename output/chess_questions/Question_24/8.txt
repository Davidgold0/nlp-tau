Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'r4rk1/ppp2p1p/2np1p2/2b1p3/4P1b1/2PP1N2/PP3P1P/RN2KBR1 b Q - 1 10'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning tactic is 

  g4f3

Here’s the idea. Black’s dark–squared bishop on g4 can capture the white knight on f3. White is forced to recapture with the queen (since no pawn or other piece is available), and after 11.Qxf3 Black follows with 11...Nd4. This knight jump not only hits the queen, but it also threatens the nasty fork Nxf3+ (attacking White’s king and the rook on g1). As a result, White will lose material. Therefore, the best move for Black is

g4f3
