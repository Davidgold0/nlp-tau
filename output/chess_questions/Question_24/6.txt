Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'r4rk1/ppp2p1p/2np1p2/2b1p3/4P1b1/2PP1N2/PP3P1P/RN2KBR1 b Q - 1 10'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The best move is c5f2. 

To explain briefly without giving away full engine details: Black can immediately take advantage of the very active diagonal from the c5–bishop. By playing c5f2, Black removes a key defender (the f2–pawn) and, after the forced recapture (with the king), will obtain a dangerously exposed enemy monarch with tactical possibilities coming (such as a knight leap with check, discovered attacks, etc.). In engine–analysis terms the sacrifice on f2 leads to a winning initiative.

Thus, the single best move is: c5f2.
