Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '6r1/1P5p/3bp3/8/3k4/2R2K2/7P/3N4 w - - 1 45'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning idea is to turn the passed b‐pawn into a new queen. In the critical position the engine finds that immediately promoting (with b7–b8=Q) is best. (Any alternative run lets Black’s pieces get active, and in fact after 1. b7b8=Q Black’s only “interesting” try is to capture the new queen, but then White’s ensuing activity – with the extra firepower from the newly created queen – gives decisive compensation.) 

So the best move is: b7b8
