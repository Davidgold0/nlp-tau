Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '6r1/1P5p/3bp3/8/3k4/2R2K2/7P/3N4 w - - 1 45'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning idea is to prepare the b‐pawn’s promotion so that if Black tries to capture the new queen it loses material. By shifting the rook over to b3, White covers the b–file so that after 1. Rb3 the threat 2. b7–b8=Q becomes decisive: if Black takes the promoted queen with …Bxb8, then White recaptures with Rxb8, winning material.

Thus the best move is:
