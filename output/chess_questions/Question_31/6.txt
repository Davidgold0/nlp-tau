Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '2r2r1k/p5p1/2R1Q2p/3pBn2/3P4/8/P5PP/2q4K w - - 0 29'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The move is e6f5. 

After checking the tactics in the position, White can capture the knight on f5 by playing Qxf5. No satisfactory recapture is available for Black, so this move wins material for White.
