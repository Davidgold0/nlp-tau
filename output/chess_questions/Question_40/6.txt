Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'rn1q1bnr/1pp1kBpp/3p4/p3N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BbK2R w KQ - 1 7'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning tactical idea is to eliminate Black’s very misplaced dark‐squared bishop on d1. By playing 1.Nc3d1, White’s knight from c3 hops into d1 and immediately wins that bishop (since nothing defends it) while also unblocking the queenside for future play. 

Thus, the best move is: Nc3d1.
