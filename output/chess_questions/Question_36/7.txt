Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'r1b2rk1/pp1p1pBp/4p3/2p1nP2/2P1P3/1P4R1/P5PP/7K w - - 6 22'

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning move is to capture on f8 with the bishop – that is,  g7f8. 

To explain briefly without giving away a full analysis: White’s bishop on g7 is perfectly placed to take the black rook on f8. After 22. g7f8 and the forced recapture by the king, White obtains a decisive initiative. In the resulting tactics – after following up with a forcing rook move – White wins material and soon gains a winning position.

Thus, the best move for White is: g7f8.
