Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '8/pp2Qpk1/6p1/3PN2r/7q/3B2K1/PP6/8 w - - 1 36'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning “trick‐move” is to play 36.Ng6. 

Here’s the idea. White’s queen is “aiming” along the 7th–rank to hit g7 with mate—but the black pawn on f7 is in the way. In the move 36.Ng6, White’s knight from e5 goes to g6 by capturing Black’s g6–pawn. (Note that the knight from e5 can go “two‐right and one–up” to g6.) This move does not give an immediate check but it has a dual motive. First, if Black recaptures on g6 with 36…Kxg6 then the blocking pawn on f7 has now disappeared (and the recapturing king on g6 is no longer in the “shield” of his pawn), so that 37.Qxg7 becomes mate. Alternatively, if Black declines the capture then White will swing in with 37.Nxh4 and win Black’s queen. In either case Black is lost.

Hence the decisive move is: 

  e5g6

(That is, move the knight from e5 to g6.)
