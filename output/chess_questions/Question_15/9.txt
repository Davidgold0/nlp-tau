Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '8/pp2Qpk1/6p1/3PN2r/7q/3B2K1/PP6/8 w - - 1 36'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning move is e5f7. 

To explain briefly without giving away all tactical details: White’s knight on e5 can jump to f7 with check. This move is so forceful that if Black doesn’t capture the knight, White immediately mates on the next move with the queen. Even if Black does capture on f7, the ensuing tactics leave Black in a lost position. Thus, the best move for White is e5f7.
