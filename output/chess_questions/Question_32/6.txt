Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '8/pp3pk1/6p1/3PN2r/7Q/3B2K1/PP6/8 b - - 0 36'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning move is to capture White’s knight on e5 with the rook. The move is:

h5e5

Here's a brief rationale: 
• On the fifth rank, White’s knight on e5 is unprotected.  
• Black’s rook on h5 can slide horizontally to e5 (with squares f5 and g5 empty) to capture it.  
• This wins material, giving Black a clear advantage.

Thus, the best move for Black is h5e5.
