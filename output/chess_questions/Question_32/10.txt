Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '8/pp3pk1/6p1/3PN2r/7Q/3B2K1/PP6/8 b - - 0 36'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: I recommend playing 36...Rg5+.

To explain briefly without revealing all calculation details: Black’s rook on h5 can swing along the fifth‐rank in order to give a forcing check. After 36...Rg5+ White’s king is forced into an awkward spot – and in many variations Black is then ready to pick up the queen (or gain decisive counter‐play) without falling victim to the usual knight–fork ideas. (Among candidate moves, immediate capture of the queen on h4 by …Rxh4 runs into 37.Nf7+ and loses material; the check on g5 avoids that resource.) 

Thus, the best move is:

Answer: h5g5
