Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '2r2r1k/p5p1/4Q2p/3pBn2/3P4/8/P5PP/2R4K b - - 0 29'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The strongest move for Black is to play f5g3. 

Explanation (brief outline): In the given position the Black knight on f5 is attacked by the White queen on e6. Rather than retreat passively, Black gains counter‐play by transferring the knight from f5 to g3. From g3 the knight immediately checks the White king (attacking the h1 square) and creates counter‐threats. Detailed analysis shows that, among all legal knight moves from f5, f5g3 is the most forcing reply – it not only saves the knight, which would otherwise be captured, but also forces White to respond to the check, giving Black tactical possibilities.

Thus, the best move is f5g3.
