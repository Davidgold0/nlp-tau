Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'R4bk1/3prp1p/1Q6/1pP2ppN/3P4/4P1P1/5PKP/1q6 b - - 3 30'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: I recommend the move b1a1. 

After 30…b1a1 the black queen immediately eyes the white rook on a8 along the a–file. In the current position the rook on a8 is very “sticky” – if it remains on the a–file it will eventually fall, and if it tries to run away White’s counter‐play doesn’t compensate for the loss of material. (Of course, precise play is required from both sides, but after 30…b1a1 Black’s active threats tip the scales.) 

Thus, the best move for Black is: b1a1.
