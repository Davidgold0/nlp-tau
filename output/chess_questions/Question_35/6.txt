Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'R4bk1/3prp1p/1Q6/1pP2ppN/3P4/4P1P1/5PKP/1q6 b - - 3 30'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning idea is to start with a forcing queen‐check that drives white’s king into a “trap” where the knight on h5 falls. In fact, after

  30…Qg1+

white’s best moves (for example Kh2) run into

  …Qh1+ 
    and then …Qxh5, winning the knight. 

Thus the best move for Black is:
