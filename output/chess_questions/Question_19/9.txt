Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'r1b2r1k/pp1p1pBp/4p3/2p1nP2/2P1P3/1P4R1/P5PP/7K b - - 5 21'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: I recommend the knight‐move  e5f3  as Black’s best reply. 

To explain briefly without giving away all the calculation details: Black’s knight on e5 can jump to f3 where it not only eyes dangerous entry squares around White’s king (with ideas such as an eventual hop toward h2 that would prove very troublesome) but also increases the pressure on the kingside. This move forces White to respond very carefully against emerging tactical threats. Detailed analysis shows that after 21…e5f3 Black’s pieces come active and create problems for White that are difficult to meet. 

So, the best move is: e5f3.
