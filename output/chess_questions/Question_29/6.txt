Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '8/5k2/p2pNqpr/2pPp3/2P1B3/4P3/PP2KR2/8 b - - 5 46'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning move is f6f2. 

To explain briefly without revealing all internal calculation details: Black has a very strong tactical resource. By playing 1...Qxf2+ (i.e. moving the queen from f6 to f2 and capturing the white rook on f2 with check), Black forces White into a dilemma. If White tries to avoid the capture by moving the king, Black’s various subsequent threats lead to decisive material gains. Even if White accepts the queen for the rook (by Kxf2), Black comes out clearly ahead – having exchanged a queen for a rook while neutralizing White’s dangerous knight on e6. 

Thus, the best move for Black is:

f6f2
