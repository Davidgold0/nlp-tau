Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '8/5k2/p2pNqpr/2pPp3/2P1B3/4P3/PP2KR2/8 b - - 5 46'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning move is h6f2. 

To explain briefly without giving full lines: by playing 46...Rxf2 Black sacrifices the rook on f2. White’s only reasonable recapture is with the king, after which Black picks up the unprotected knight on e6 with the queen. This win‐on‐tactical grounds leaves Black with a decisive material advantage. 

The best move for Black is: h6f2.
