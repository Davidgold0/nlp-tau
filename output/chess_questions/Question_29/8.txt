Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '8/5k2/p2pNqpr/2pPp3/2P1B3/4P3/PP2KR2/8 b - - 5 46'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: I'll answer:

Qg5

That is, move the queen from f6 to g5. 

In my “engine‐style” evaluation the move Qg5 is the one that keeps the initiative for Black. It places the queen on a very active square along the g5–? diagonal and increases the pressure on White’s somewhat awkward pieces (especially given the over‐extended knight on e6 whose defender – the pawn on d5 – is hard to cope with). Precise tactical and positional details show that after 1...Qg5 Black gains a lasting advantage.

So my answer is: Qg5 (in algebraic notation: f6g5).
