Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '1r3rk1/6p1/3p3p/3P4/3Q1p2/2n4P/5PP1/R4RK1 b - - 0 28'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The best move is c3e4. 

To explain briefly without giving away all engine details: Black’s knight on c3 is under fire from White’s queen on d4. Rather than retreating passively, Black can counterattack by jumping the knight to e4. This not only saves the knight but also forces White’s queen to move and yields Black active play in the center. Detailed tactical and positional considerations back up that 28...Ne4 is the strongest response in the position.
