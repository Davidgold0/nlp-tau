Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '6k1/6pn/Q6p/1p2R3/8/5r2/1q3PPP/6K1 w - - 0 27'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The move is a6g6

Let’s explain briefly. In the position, White’s queen on a6 can give a decisive check with Qg6+. After 27.Qg6+ black’s king has only a few moves. For example, if 27…Kf8 then the mate follows immediately with 28.Qxf7#, while 27…Kh8 is met by 28.Qxh7#. (Other king moves run into similarly forced mating ideas.) 

Thus the best (and winning) move for White is to go from a6 to g6.
