Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'r4r1k/ppp2p1p/2np1p2/2b1p3/4P1b1/2PP1N2/PP3P1P/RN2KBR1 w Q - 2 11'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: g1g4

Let's explain briefly: In the position the white rook on g1 is already sitting on a dangerous diagonal from Black’s bishop on c5 (which eyes the square g1 along the diagonal c5–d4–e3–f2–g1). Rather than allow Black to capture the rook, White can get more than just a “saving move”: by moving the rook along the g–file to g4, it not only escapes the threat but also captures Black’s undefended bishop on g4. This ensures a net material gain and sidesteps the impending tactical problems.
