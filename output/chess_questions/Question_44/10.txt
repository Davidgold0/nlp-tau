Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '4R1k1/6pn/Q6p/1p6/8/5r2/1q3PPP/6K1 b - - 1 27'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: I recommend the move b2d4.

After 27…b2d4, Black immediately creates a mate‐threat along the diagonal toward the white king. In the position the pawn on f2 is covering the long diagonal from d4 to g1, but by placing the queen on d4 Black threatens to remove that defender (or otherwise force concessions) so that Qxf2 will be deadly. In many variations White finds it very hard to meet the threat without losing decisive material or succumbing to mate. (Of course, in a concrete engine analysis many lines are examined, but the tactical pressure created by …b2d4 is the key resource that gives Black a strong practical advantage.)

So the best move in the given position is: b2d4.
