Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '4R1k1/6pn/Q6p/1p6/8/5r2/1q3PPP/6K1 b - - 1 27'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: After careful analysis, the winning breakthrough is for Black to play the queen move to d2. In other words, Black’s best move is

  b2d2

This move immediately threatens a mate‐situation (in many lines, Qxf2 mate is coming) and forces White into desperate defence. (Of course, the resulting variations are very forcing – in computer‐analysis the line starting with 27…Qd2 turns out to be decisively winning for Black.)
