Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'b1r5/5p1k/4p1p1/4P2p/R2PP3/R1P1b1QP/5NPK/N3q3 b - - 8 41'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The move that gives Black a decisive tactical advantage is

  c8c3

In the position given by the FEN, after 41...c8c3 Black “sacrifices” the rook by capturing on c3. This move forces White into recapturing with the a‐file rook and then lets Black win the trapped knight on a1 by playing Qxa1. (Any other white reply runs into serious tactical problems.) Hence, 41...c8c3 is the strongest move for Black.
