Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'b1r5/5p1k/4p1p1/4P2p/R2PP3/R1P1b1QP/5NPK/N3q3 b - - 8 41'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The move is e3f2. 

To explain briefly without giving away all the tactical details: by playing 1...Bxf2 you sacrifice the bishop by capturing White’s knight on f2. The recapture with the queen is forced, after which Black’s queen can recapture and win the White queen – a sequence that results in a decisive material gain for Black.
