Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '1r2r1k1/5pp1/p6Q/2p5/4p3/1P4q1/P1P2PPP/4R1K1 w - - 0 31'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning move is e1e8. 

To explain briefly without giving away all the tactical details: by taking on e8 with the rook, White removes a key defender while simultaneously giving check. In many variations—including the critical ones where Black’s king steps aside—the discovered power and support of White’s queen (from h6) combine with the rook’s intervention so that mates (or decisive material gains) follow immediately. 

Thus, the best move is: e1e8.
