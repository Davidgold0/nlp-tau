Hi Maor,

We’ve been running initial tests on our pipeline, which currently uses two LLMs. So far, we’ve seen better results when combining o3-mini with 4o-mini, compared to using either 4o or o3-mini alone.

For the upcoming evaluation, I’d like to run the pipeline 5 times per question to reduce variability. We are considering a few model combinations and wanted to get your input:

o3-mini followed by 4o-mini (current setup)

o3-mini for both LLMs

4o for both LLMs

Do you have a preference or recommendation for which setup I should use during testing?

Thanks,
