Question: Because of redistricting, Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students. This is an increase of $4\%$ over last year's enrollment. What was last year's enrollment?
Teacher: Let's begin by understanding the problem together. The question tells us that the current enrollment is 598 students, which is a 4% increase over last year's enrollment. In other words, last year's enrollment increased by 4% to become 598 students.

Here’s how we can approach the problem step by step:

1. Let last year’s enrollment be represented by x.
2. Because the enrollment increased by 4%, the current enrollment is x plus 4% of x, which can be expressed as 1.04x.
3. We then set up the equation: 1.04x = 598.
4. Finally, we solve for x by dividing 598 by 1.04.

Now, please try working on the first step: defining the variable and setting up the equation based on the information. What equation do you think we should use to represent the situation?
Student: To represent the situation, we can define last year's enrollment as \( x \). Since the enrollment increased by 4%, the current enrollment can be expressed as \( 1.04x \). 

So, we set up the equation as follows:

\[
1.04x = 598
\]

This equation shows that last year's enrollment multiplied by 1.04 equals the current enrollment of 598 students. 

Is this setup correct, Teacher?
Teacher: You're on the right track! Your setup of defining last year's enrollment as x and writing the equation 1.04x = 598 is correct.

Now, can you work on the next step? Please solve the equation for x by isolating x. What value do you get when you divide 598 by 1.04?
Student: Sure! To isolate \( x \), we need to divide both sides of the equation \( 1.04x = 598 \) by 1.04. 

So, we perform the calculation:

\[
x = \frac{598}{1.04}
\]

Now, calculating that gives:

\[
x \approx 574.04
\]

Since enrollment must be a whole number, we can round this to 574. 

So, last year's enrollment was approximately 574 students. 

Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: You're very close! However, there's a small discrepancy in your calculation. Remember, when you divide 598 by 1.04, you should get exactly the number that, when multiplied back by 1.04, returns 598. 

Could you please re-check your division of 598 by 1.04 carefully? Perhaps try verifying by multiplying your candidate quotient back by 1.04 to see if you obtain 598. What result do you get?
Student: Thank you for your guidance, Teacher. Let me re-check the division of 598 by 1.04.

Calculating it again:

\[
x = \frac{598}{1.04}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
x \approx 574.0384615
\]

Now, rounding this to the nearest whole number gives us 574. 

To verify, I will multiply 574 by 1.04 to see if I get back to 598:

\[
574 \times 1.04 = 597.76
\]

This is close to 598, but not exact. 

Let me try using the exact result from the division without rounding:

\[
x \approx 574.0384615
\]

If I take that exact value and multiply it by 1.04:

\[
574.0384615 \times 1.04 \approx 598
\]

This confirms that my exact calculation is correct. 

So, last year's enrollment should be \( 574 \) when rounded to the nearest whole number. 

Is this satisfactory, Teacher?
Teacher: Great job checking your work! You've correctly calculated that dividing 598 by 1.04 gives approximately 574.0384615, and when rounded to the nearest whole number, last year's enrollment is 574 students.

Since the context of the problem (enrollment figures) requires a whole number, your final answer is correct.

Final answer: 574$
