Question: Because of redistricting, Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students. This is an increase of $4\%$ over last year's enrollment. What was last year's enrollment?
Teacher: Let's start by understanding what the problem is asking. We know that this year's enrollment is 598 students, which represents a 4% increase over last year’s enrollment. If we let x be last year’s enrollment, then this year's enrollment is 104% of last year's enrollment. How would you write an equation that relates x (last year’s enrollment) to 598 students? Please show me the equation you come up with for this step.
Student: To relate last year's enrollment (x) to this year's enrollment of 598 students, I can express this relationship using the information about the 4% increase. 

Since this year's enrollment is a 4% increase over last year's enrollment, it represents 104% of last year's enrollment. We can write the equation as:

\[ 
1.04x = 598 
\]

This equation shows that last year's enrollment (x) multiplied by 1.04 equals this year's enrollment of 598 students. 

Is this the correct way to set up the equation?
Teacher: You're exactly correct in setting up the equation as 1.04x = 598. Great work! 

Now, for the next step, we need to find the value of x (last year's enrollment). To do that, can you show me how you would isolate x in the equation? What operation would you perform, and what would the next equation look like?
Student: Student: To isolate x in the equation \(1.04x = 598\), I need to divide both sides of the equation by 1.04. This will give me the value of x by itself. 

So, the next equation would look like this:

\[
x = \frac{598}{1.04}
\]

Now I can calculate that to find last year's enrollment. Would you like me to go ahead and do that calculation?
Teacher: That's right! You've correctly rearranged the equation to solve for x. Now, proceed by calculating x = 598/1.04. What is the value you get for x? Please share your calculation.
Student: Student: Okay! Now I will calculate \( x = \frac{598}{1.04} \).

Performing the division:

\[
x = 598 \div 1.04 \approx 574.04
\]

Since enrollment must be a whole number, I will round this to the nearest whole number, which gives me:

\[
x \approx 574
\]

So, last year's enrollment was approximately 574 students. Does that look correct?
Teacher: Your setup was perfect! However, your numerical result seems a bit off. Let's check the calculation carefully. You have x = 598 / 1.04. Can you try re-calculating this division step-by-step to see if there might be a mistake? Take your time and work through the arithmetic accurately.
Student: Student: Sure! Let's carefully go through the calculation of \( x = \frac{598}{1.04} \) step-by-step.

First, I will perform the division:

1. **Set up the division**: \( 598 \div 1.04 \)

2. **Convert 1.04 to a fraction**: This is equivalent to \( \frac{598}{\frac{104}{100}} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{598 \times 100}{104} \).

3. **Calculate the numerator**: \( 598 \times 100 = 59800 \).

4. **Now divide by 104**: 
   \[
   59800 \div 104 \approx 574.0385
   \]

Since we are looking for a whole number for enrollment, I round this to the nearest whole number, which gives me:

\[
x \approx 574
\]

So, after re-calculating, last year's enrollment is still approximately 574 students. Does this calculation look better?
Teacher: You're very close with your setup, but it looks like there might be a slight error in the final arithmetic. Let's reexamine the calculation together without doing it directly.

Consider this: When you rewrite the fraction x = 598 / 1.04, one way to simplify the division is to eliminate the decimal by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by 100. Can you perform that step and then simplify the fraction? What result do you get for x?
Student: Student: Okay, let's follow your suggestion and eliminate the decimal by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 100. 

Starting with the equation:

\[
x = \frac{598}{1.04}
\]

I will multiply the numerator and the denominator by 100:

\[
x = \frac{598 \times 100}{1.04 \times 100} = \frac{59800}{104}
\]

Now, I will perform the division \( 59800 \div 104 \):

1. **Calculate the division**: 
   \[
   59800 \div 104 = 574.0385
   \]

Now, rounding this to the nearest whole number gives me:

\[
x \approx 574
\]

However, since we are looking for the exact value, I will perform the division accurately:

\[
59800 \div 104 = 574
\]

So, last year's enrollment was exactly 574 students. Does this look correct now?
Teacher: You're on the right track, but let's reexamine the arithmetic carefully. When you got to the step

 x = 59800/104

we can check the result by multiplying 104 by a candidate result. For instance, if you try 575: What is 104 × 575? Does it equal 59800? Please verify this multiplication step, and then let me know your conclusion for x.
Student: Student: Alright, let's check the multiplication of 104 by 575 to see if it equals 59800.

Calculating:

\[
104 \times 575 = 104 \times (500 + 75) = (104 \times 500) + (104 \times 75)
\]

Calculating each part:

1. \( 104 \times 500 = 52000 \)
2. \( 104 \times 75 = 7800 \)

Now, adding those together:

\[
52000 + 7800 = 59800
\]

Since \( 104 \times 575 = 59800 \), it confirms that the calculation is correct.

Thus, last year's enrollment, \( x \), is indeed 575 students. Thank you for guiding me through the verification! Does this final answer look correct?
Teacher: Excellent work verifying the multiplication! You've carefully checked that 104 × 575 = 59800, which confirms that solving the equation 1.04x = 598 leads to x = 575. Great job working through each step.
