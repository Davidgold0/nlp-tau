Question: Find all solutions to the equation\[ \sqrt[4]{x} = \frac{12}{7 - \sqrt[4]{x}}.\]
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the equation step by step. The equation given is

  √[4]{x} = 12 / (7 – √[4]{x}).

A useful first step is to simplify the equation by making a substitution. For example, let's set y = √[4]{x}. After doing this, the equation will become an equation in terms of y. What equation do you get after this substitution?
Student: After making the substitution \( y = \sqrt[4]{x} \), the equation 

\[
\sqrt[4]{x} = \frac{12}{7 - \sqrt[4]{x}}
\]

becomes 

\[
y = \frac{12}{7 - y}.
\]

Now we can work with this equation in terms of \( y \). What should we do next to solve for \( y \)?
Teacher: Great job identifying the substitution and rewriting the equation in terms of y!

The next step is to remove the fraction by cross-multiplying. How would you write the equation after cross-multiplying, and what equation do you get in terms of y?
Student: Student: After cross-multiplying the equation 

\[
y = \frac{12}{7 - y},
\]

we get:

\[
y(7 - y) = 12.
\]

Expanding this gives us:

\[
7y - y^2 = 12.
\]

Rearranging the equation, we have:

\[
y^2 - 7y + 12 = 0.
\]

What should I do next to solve this quadratic equation for \( y \)?
Teacher: Excellent work so far! You've transformed the equation into the quadratic

  y² - 7y + 12 = 0.

A good next step would be to solve this quadratic equation. One common method is to factor it. Could you please try to factor the quadratic equation? What factors of 12 add up to -7, and what possible factors do you get?
Student: To factor the quadratic equation \( y^2 - 7y + 12 = 0 \), we need to find two numbers that multiply to \( 12 \) and add up to \( -7 \).

The factors of \( 12 \) that fit this requirement are \( -3 \) and \( -4 \), since:

\[
-3 \times -4 = 12 \quad \text{and} \quad -3 + (-4) = -7.
\]

So, we can factor the quadratic as:

\[
(y - 3)(y - 4) = 0.
\]

Now, what are the solutions for \( y \) from this factored equation?
Teacher: Great work factoring the quadratic! From (y – 3)(y – 4) = 0, what values of y do you obtain?

Please show your work for finding the solutions for y.
Student: From the factored equation \((y - 3)(y - 4) = 0\), we can find the solutions for \(y\) by setting each factor equal to zero:

1. \(y - 3 = 0\) gives us:
   \[
   y = 3.
   \]

2. \(y - 4 = 0\) gives us:
   \[
   y = 4.
   \]

So, the solutions for \(y\) are \(y = 3\) and \(y = 4\). 

What should I do next to find the corresponding values of \(x\)?
Teacher: Great work! You're now ready to find the corresponding values for x. Remember, you have the substitution y = √[4]{x}, which tells you that x = y⁴. 

Please compute:
 • x when y = 3 (i.e., x = 3⁴)
 • x when y = 4 (i.e., x = 4⁴)

Let me know what you get for x in each case, and we'll check your work together.
Student: To find the corresponding values of \(x\) from the solutions for \(y\), I will use the substitution \(x = y^4\).

1. For \(y = 3\):
   \[
   x = 3^4 = 81.
   \]

2. For \(y = 4\):
   \[
   x = 4^4 = 256.
   \]

Thus, the corresponding values of \(x\) are \(x = 81\) and \(x = 256\). 

What should I do next to ensure these solutions are valid for the original equation?
Teacher: Great progress so far! To be sure that your solutions are valid, you now want to verify them in the original equation. Remember, the original equation is

  √[4]{x} = 12 / (7 – √[4]{x}).

A good next step is to substitute each of your x-values (81 and 256) back into the equation and check if both sides match. Could you please substitute x = 81 into the equation and verify that it holds true? Let me know what you find.
Student: To verify the solution \(x = 81\) in the original equation 

\[
\sqrt[4]{x} = \frac{12}{7 - \sqrt[4]{x}},
\]

I will substitute \(x = 81\):

1. First, calculate \(\sqrt[4]{81}\):
   \[
   \sqrt[4]{81} = \sqrt[4]{3^4} = 3.
   \]

2. Now, substitute \(y = 3\) into the right side of the equation:
   \[
   \frac{12}{7 - \sqrt[4]{81}} = \frac{12}{7 - 3} = \frac{12}{4} = 3.
   \]

Now, we have both sides of the equation:

\[
3 = 3.
\]

This shows that \(x = 81\) is indeed a valid solution.

Next, I will check \(x = 256\) in the original equation. 

1. Calculate \(\sqrt[4]{256}\):
   \[
   \sqrt[4]{256} = \sqrt[4]{4^4} = 4.
   \]

2. Substitute \(y = 4\) into the right side of the equation:
   \[
   \frac{12}{7 - \sqrt[4]{256}} = \frac{12}{7 - 4} = \frac{12}{3} = 4.
   \]

Now, we have both sides of the equation again:

\[
4 = 4.
\]

This confirms that \(x = 256\) is also a valid solution.

In conclusion, both solutions \(x = 81\) and \(x = 256\) are valid for the original equation.
Teacher: Great job verifying both solutions! Before we wrap up, let’s summarize what we did:

1. We substituted y = ⁴√x to turn the original equation into y = 12/(7 – y).  
2. We cross-multiplied to eliminate the fraction, obtaining y(7 – y) = 12, which expanded to 7y – y² = 12 and was rearranged as y² – 7y + 12 = 0.  
3. We factored the quadratic to get (y – 3)(y – 4) = 0, yielding y = 3 and y = 4.  
4. Returning to our substitution, we set x = y⁴ and computed x = 3⁴ = 81 and x = 4⁴ = 256.  
5. Finally, we verified that both x-values satisfy the original equation.

Your work at every step has been clear and correct. The final answer, with x-values that satisfy the equation, is:

81, 256$
