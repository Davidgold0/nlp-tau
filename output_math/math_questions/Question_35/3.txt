Question: Find all solutions to the equation\[ \sqrt[4]{x} = \frac{12}{7 - \sqrt[4]{x}}.\]
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem. The equation is

  √[4]{x} = 12/(7 - √[4]{x}).

A good first step is to simplify the equation by introducing a substitution. For instance, you can let y = √[4]{x}. With that substitution, how can you rewrite the original equation in terms of y? 

Please work on rewriting the equation with this substitution as your next step.
Student: Sure! With the substitution \( y = \sqrt[4]{x} \), we can rewrite the original equation as follows:

\[
y = \frac{12}{7 - y}.
\]

Now we have the equation in terms of \( y \). What's the next step we should take to solve for \( y \)?
Teacher: Great work rewriting the equation as

  y = 12/(7 – y).

The next step is to eliminate the denominator by multiplying both sides of the equation by (7 – y). Could you do that and simplify the resulting equation? Please solve just that step.
Student: Sure! To eliminate the denominator, we multiply both sides of the equation by \( (7 - y) \):

\[
y(7 - y) = 12.
\]

Now, distributing \( y \) on the left side gives us:

\[
7y - y^2 = 12.
\]

Next, we can rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:

\[
-y^2 + 7y - 12 = 0.
\]

To make it a standard quadratic equation, we can multiply through by -1:

\[
y^2 - 7y + 12 = 0.
\]

What should we do next to solve this quadratic equation?
Teacher: Great job so far! You've successfully rewritten the equation and obtained the quadratic

  y² – 7y + 12 = 0.

For the next step, we need to solve this quadratic. One common method is to factor it, if possible. Could you try factoring y² – 7y + 12? What factors of 12 add up to 7 (considering the sign)? Please work on that step and share your reasoning.
Student: Sure! To factor the quadratic equation \( y^2 - 7y + 12 = 0 \), we need to find two numbers that multiply to \( 12 \) (the constant term) and add up to \( -7 \) (the coefficient of \( y \)).

The factors of \( 12 \) that satisfy these conditions are \( -3 \) and \( -4 \), since:

\[
-3 \times -4 = 12 \quad \text{and} \quad -3 + -4 = -7.
\]

So, we can factor the quadratic as follows:

\[
(y - 3)(y - 4) = 0.
\]

Now, we can set each factor equal to zero to find the solutions for \( y \). What should we do next?
Teacher: You've factored the quadratic correctly, yielding (y – 3)(y – 4) = 0, so we have y = 3 or y = 4. 

Now, recall our substitution y = √[4]{x}. Using that, what is the next step to solve for x? Please solve just that step by expressing x in terms of y.
Student: Sure! Since we have the solutions for \( y \) as \( y = 3 \) and \( y = 4 \), we can now use our substitution \( y = \sqrt[4]{x} \) to express \( x \) in terms of \( y \).

1. For \( y = 3 \):
   \[
   \sqrt[4]{x} = 3.
   \]
   To find \( x \), we raise both sides to the power of 4:
   \[
   x = 3^4 = 81.
   \]

2. For \( y = 4 \):
   \[
   \sqrt[4]{x} = 4.
   \]
   Again, raising both sides to the power of 4 gives us:
   \[
   x = 4^4 = 256.
   \]

Now we have two solutions for \( x \): \( x = 81 \) and \( x = 256 \). What should I do next?
Teacher: You've done a fantastic job so far by finding y = 3 and y = 4 and then converting these back into x = 81 and x = 256 with our substitution y = √[4]{x}.

The next important step is to verify that these solutions are valid in the original equation. Specifically, check that when you substitute each x back into

  √[4]{x} = 12/(7 – √[4]{x}),

both sides match and that no restrictions (like a zero denominator) are violated. Could you work through this verification step for one of the solutions? Please show your work for, say, x = 81.
Student: Sure! Let's verify the solution \( x = 81 \) by substituting it back into the original equation:

\[
\sqrt[4]{x} = \frac{12}{7 - \sqrt[4]{x}}.
\]

First, we need to calculate \( \sqrt[4]{81} \):

\[
\sqrt[4]{81} = \sqrt[4]{3^4} = 3.
\]

Now, we substitute \( \sqrt[4]{x} \) with \( 3 \) in the equation:

The left side becomes:

\[
\sqrt[4]{81} = 3.
\]

Now for the right side, we substitute \( \sqrt[4]{81} \) into the equation:

\[
\frac{12}{7 - \sqrt[4]{81}} = \frac{12}{7 - 3} = \frac{12}{4} = 3.
\]

Now we compare both sides:

Left side: \( 3 \)

Right side: \( 3 \)

Since both sides are equal, the solution \( x = 81 \) is valid.

Now, should I verify the other solution \( x = 256 \) as well?
Teacher: Great verification for x = 81! To complete our solution, the next step is to verify the other candidate: x = 256. Please substitute x = 256 into the original equation

  √[4]{x} = 12/(7 – √[4]{x})

and check that both sides match. What do you get when you verify x = 256?
Student: Sure! Let's verify the solution \( x = 256 \) by substituting it back into the original equation:

\[
\sqrt[4]{x} = \frac{12}{7 - \sqrt[4]{x}}.
\]

First, we need to calculate \( \sqrt[4]{256} \):

\[
\sqrt[4]{256} = \sqrt[4]{4^4} = 4.
\]

Now, we substitute \( \sqrt[4]{x} \) with \( 4 \) in the equation:

The left side becomes:

\[
\sqrt[4]{256} = 4.
\]

Now for the right side, we substitute \( \sqrt[4]{256} \) into the equation:

\[
\frac{12}{7 - \sqrt[4]{256}} = \frac{12}{7 - 4} = \frac{12}{3} = 4.
\]

Now we compare both sides:

Left side: \( 4 \)

Right side: \( 4 \)

Since both sides are equal, the solution \( x = 256 \) is also valid.

In conclusion, the solutions to the equation \( \sqrt[4]{x} = \frac{12}{7 - \sqrt[4]{x}} \) are:

\[
\boxed{81 \text{ and } 256}.
\]
Teacher: You've done an excellent job verifying each step and confirming both solutions. 

To summarize:
1. We introduced the substitution y = √[4]{x}.
2. With this substitution, the equation became y = 12/(7 – y).
3. Multiplying by (7 – y) and rearranging yielded the quadratic y² – 7y + 12 = 0.
4. This quadratic was factored as (y – 3)(y – 4) = 0, giving the solutions y = 3 and y = 4.
5. Converting back via x = y⁴, we obtained x = 3⁴ = 81 and x = 4⁴ = 256.
6. We verified each solution by substituting x back into the original equation, confirming they are correct.

Thus, the final answer is: 81 and 256$
