Question: Find all solutions to the equation\[ \sqrt[4]{x} = \frac{12}{7 - \sqrt[4]{x}}.\]
Teacher: Alright, let's begin our process for solving the equation

  √[4]{x} = 12/(7 − √[4]{x}).

A helpful way to start is by setting a variable to simplify the expression. Here’s an outline of the steps we might take:

1. Let y = √[4]{x}. Then the equation becomes:
  y = 12/(7 − y).

2. Multiply both sides of the equation by (7 − y) to eliminate the fraction.

3. Rearrange and simplify the resulting equation to form a quadratic equation in terms of y.

4. Solve the quadratic equation for y.

5. Once you have the values for y, recall that y = √[4]{x} and then find x by raising y to the fourth power, i.e., x = y⁴.

Now, let’s work on the very first step together.

Can you start by performing the substitution (letting y = √[4]{x}) and rewriting the given equation in terms of y? Please share your work for this step.
Student: Sure! Let's start by making the substitution as you suggested.

1. Let \( y = \sqrt[4]{x} \). 

Now, we rewrite the original equation:

\[
y = \frac{12}{7 - y}.
\]

This is our new equation in terms of \( y \). What should we do next?
Teacher: Great job substituting y for √[4]{x} and rewriting the equation as y = 12/(7 − y). 

Now, for the next step, let's eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by (7 − y). Can you perform that multiplication and show what equation you get?
Student: Student: Sure! Let's multiply both sides of the equation by \( (7 - y) \) to eliminate the fraction.

Starting with the equation:

\[
y = \frac{12}{7 - y},
\]

we multiply both sides by \( (7 - y) \):

\[
y(7 - y) = 12.
\]

Now, distributing \( y \) on the left side gives us:

\[
7y - y^2 = 12.
\]

Rearranging this equation to bring all terms to one side, we get:

\[
-y^2 + 7y - 12 = 0.
\]

To make it a standard quadratic equation, we can multiply through by -1:

\[
y^2 - 7y + 12 = 0.
\]

What should we do next?
Teacher: Great work! You've correctly reached the quadratic equation:

  y² - 7y + 12 = 0.

Now, the next step is to solve this quadratic equation for y. One common method is to factor the quadratic. Can you try factoring this equation to find the possible values of y? Please share your work for this step.
Student: Sure! Let's factor the quadratic equation \( y^2 - 7y + 12 = 0 \).

We need to find two numbers that multiply to \( 12 \) (the constant term) and add up to \( -7 \) (the coefficient of \( y \)). The numbers that satisfy this are \( -3 \) and \( -4 \).

So, we can factor the quadratic as follows:

\[
(y - 3)(y - 4) = 0.
\]

Now, we can set each factor equal to zero to find the possible values of \( y \):

1. \( y - 3 = 0 \)  →  \( y = 3 \)
2. \( y - 4 = 0 \)  →  \( y = 4 \)

Thus, the solutions for \( y \) are \( y = 3 \) and \( y = 4 \).

What should I do next?
Teacher: Great job factoring and finding y = 3 and y = 4! Now, we need to go back to the original variable x. Recall that we set y = √[4]{x}, which implies x = y⁴.

For the next step, can you substitute y = 3 and y = 4 into x = y⁴ to find the corresponding values of x? Please show your work for this step.
Student: Sure! Let's substitute the values of \( y \) back into the equation \( x = y^4 \) to find the corresponding values of \( x \).

1. For \( y = 3 \):
   \[
   x = 3^4 = 81.
   \]

2. For \( y = 4 \):
   \[
   x = 4^4 = 256.
   \]

Thus, the solutions for \( x \) are \( x = 81 \) and \( x = 256 \).

Is there anything else I should do or check?
Teacher: Great work! You’ve correctly completed the process. Let’s quickly summarize what we did:

1. We set y = √[4]{x} to simplify the equation.
2. We rewrote the equation in terms of y and cleared the fraction by multiplying by (7 − y).
3. This led to the quadratic equation y² − 7y + 12 = 0.
4. You factored the quadratic to find y = 3 and y = 4.
5. Finally, by substituting back using x = y⁴, you obtained x = 3⁴ = 81 and x = 4⁴ = 256.

Your final solutions for the equation are: 81 and 256$
