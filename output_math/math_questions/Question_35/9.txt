Question: Find all solutions to the equation\[ \sqrt[4]{x} = \frac{12}{7 - \sqrt[4]{x}}.\]
3o-mini: Let y = √[4]{x}. Then the equation becomes:
  y = 12 / (7 - y).

Multiply both sides by (7 - y) to eliminate the fraction:
  y(7 - y) = 12.

Expanding the left side gives:
  7y - y² = 12.

Rearrange the equation into standard quadratic form:
  y² - 7y + 12 = 0.

Factor the quadratic:
  (y - 3)(y - 4) = 0.

Thus, the solutions for y are:
  y = 3 or y = 4.

Recall that y = √[4]{x}. Solve for x by raising both sides to the fourth power:
  If y = 3, then x = 3⁴ = 81.
  If y = 4, then x = 4⁴ = 256.

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are:
  x = 81 and x = 256.
