Question: Find all solutions to the equation\[ \sqrt[4]{x} = \frac{12}{7 - \sqrt[4]{x}}.\]
3o-mini: We start with the equation

  √[4]{x} = 12 / (7 − √[4]{x}).

Let y = √[4]{x}. Then the equation becomes

  y = 12 / (7 − y).

To solve for y, cross multiply:

  y(7 − y) = 12.

Expanding, we get:

  7y − y² = 12.

Rearrange the equation into standard quadratic form:

  y² − 7y + 12 = 0.

Factor the quadratic:

  (y − 3)(y − 4) = 0.

Thus, y = 3 or y = 4.

Recall that y = √[4]{x}, so:
- If √[4]{x} = 3, then x = 3⁴ = 81.
- If √[4]{x} = 4, then x = 4⁴ = 256.

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = 81 and x = 256.
