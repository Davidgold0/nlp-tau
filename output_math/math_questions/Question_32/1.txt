Question: If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2, then what is the degree of polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$?
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem in steps.

Step 1: Write the general form for each polynomial. Since f(x) is a polynomial of degree 4, and g(x) is a polynomial of degree 2, how would you generally write them using coefficients? Please provide the general forms for f(x) and g(x).
Student: Sure! 

The general form of a polynomial of degree 4, \( f(x) \), can be written as:

\[
f(x) = a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0
\]

where \( a_4 \neq 0 \) (to ensure it is indeed degree 4), and \( a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0 \) are coefficients that can be any real numbers.

The general form of a polynomial of degree 2, \( g(x) \), can be written as:

\[
g(x) = b_2 x^2 + b_1 x + b_0
\]

where \( b_2 \neq 0 \) (to ensure it is degree 2), and \( b_1, b_0 \) are also coefficients that can be any real numbers.

Let me know what the next step is!
Teacher: Great job outlining the general forms for both polynomials!

Now, let's move on to the next step.

Step 2: Write the expression for f(x) - g(x) using the general forms you provided, and then simplify by combining like terms. Once you have that expression, please identify which term determines the degree of the resulting polynomial.

Please work on this next step and share your thoughts.
Student: Sure! Based on the general forms we established, we can write the expression for \( f(x) - g(x) \) as follows:

\[
f(x) - g(x) = (a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0) - (b_2 x^2 + b_1 x + b_0)
\]

Now, let's distribute the negative sign and combine like terms:

\[
f(x) - g(x) = a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + (a_2 - b_2)x^2 + (a_1 - b_1)x + (a_0 - b_0)
\]

In this expression, the term \( a_4 x^4 \) is the highest degree term, and since \( a_4 \neq 0 \), this term will still be present in the resulting polynomial.

The degree of the resulting polynomial \( f(x) - g(x) \) is determined by the highest degree term, which is \( x^4 \). Therefore, the degree of \( f(x) - g(x) \) is 4.

Let me know if this analysis aligns with your expectations or if there are any adjustments you would like me to make!
Teacher: Great work! You've successfully combined like terms and identified that the highest degree term is a₄x⁴. Since a₄ is nonzero, the degree of f(x) – g(x) remains 4.

To summarize:  
1. You wrote down the general forms of f(x) (degree 4) and g(x) (degree 2).  
2. You set up f(x) – g(x) and combined like terms.  
3. You correctly identified that the highest power (x⁴) with nonzero coefficient determines the degree of the resulting polynomial, so the answer is 4.
