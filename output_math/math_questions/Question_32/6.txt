Question: If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2, then what is the degree of polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$?
3o-mini: If f(x) is a polynomial of degree 4, its highest-degree term is of the form ax⁴ (with a ≠ 0). Since g(x) is a degree 2 polynomial, its highest-degree term is of the form bx² (with b ≠ 0). When subtracting g(x) from f(x), the highest-degree term ax⁴ does not have a matching term to cancel out or alter its degree. Therefore, the polynomial f(x) - g(x) retains the x⁴ term, and its degree is 4.
