Question: If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2, then what is the degree of polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$?
3o-mini: Since f(x) is a 4th degree polynomial, its highest term is of the form ax⁴ (with a ≠ 0). The polynomial g(x) is of degree 2, so its highest term is of the form bx². When you subtract g(x) from f(x), the highest term ax⁴ from f(x) remains untouched because g(x) has no x⁴ term to cancel it out. Therefore, the degree of f(x) - g(x) is 4.
