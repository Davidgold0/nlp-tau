Question: Wanda is trying to locate the Fermat point $P$ of $\triangle ABC$, where $A$ is at the origin, $B$ is at $(8,-1)$, and $C$ is at $(5,4)$ (the Fermat point is the point such that the sum of its distances from the vertices of a triangle is minimized). She guesses that the point is at $P = (4,2)$, and computes the sum of the distances from $P$ to the vertices of $\triangle ABC$. If she obtains $m + n\sqrt{5}$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers, what is $m + n$?_x000D_

Teacher: Let's break down the problem together without jumping straight to the answer.

Here’s an outline of the steps we need to follow:

1. Compute the distance from P to A. Since A = (0,0) and P = (4,2), use the distance formula.
2. Compute the distance from P to B. With B = (8,-1), again apply the distance formula.
3. Compute the distance from P to C. Given C = (5,4), use the distance formula.
4. Add the three distances together. The sum should be expressible in the form m + n√5.
5. Identify m and n, and then calculate m + n.

Now, let’s focus on the first step. Compute the distance between points A = (0,0) and P = (4,2) using the distance formula. What result do you get for this distance?
Student: To compute the distance between points A = (0,0) and P = (4,2), we can use the distance formula, which is given by:

\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

Substituting the coordinates of points A and P into the formula, we have:

- \(x_1 = 0\), \(y_1 = 0\) (for point A)
- \(x_2 = 4\), \(y_2 = 2\) (for point P)

Now, we can calculate the distance:

\[
d = \sqrt{(4 - 0)^2 + (2 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{4^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{16 + 4} = \sqrt{20}
\]

We can simplify \(\sqrt{20}\) to:

\[
\sqrt{20} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 5} = 2\sqrt{5}
\]

So, the distance from P to A is \(2\sqrt{5}\). 

What should we do next?
Teacher: Great job computing the distance from A to P!

Now, let's move to the next step: Calculate the distance from point P = (4,2) to point B = (8,–1). Remember to use the distance formula:  
 Distance = √[(x₂ – x₁)² + (y₂ – y₁)²].  

Please show your work and tell me what answer you get for this distance.
Student: Student: To compute the distance between points P = (4,2) and B = (8,-1), we will use the distance formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

Substituting the coordinates of points P and B into the formula, we have:

- \(x_1 = 4\), \(y_1 = 2\) (for point P)
- \(x_2 = 8\), \(y_2 = -1\) (for point B)

Now, we can calculate the distance:

\[
d = \sqrt{(8 - 4)^2 + (-1 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{4^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25}
\]

The square root of 25 simplifies to:

\[
\sqrt{25} = 5
\]

So, the distance from P to B is \(5\).

What should we do next?
Teacher: Great work on finding the distance from P to B!

Now, let's move to the next step: calculating the distance from point P = (4,2) to point C = (5,4). Remember to use the distance formula:

 Distance = √[(x₂ – x₁)² + (y₂ – y₁)²].

Please show your work for this step and tell me the result you obtain.
Student: Student: To compute the distance between points P = (4,2) and C = (5,4), we will again use the distance formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

Substituting the coordinates of points P and C into the formula, we have:

- \(x_1 = 4\), \(y_1 = 2\) (for point P)
- \(x_2 = 5\), \(y_2 = 4\) (for point C)

Now, we can calculate the distance:

\[
d = \sqrt{(5 - 4)^2 + (4 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4} = \sqrt{5}
\]

So, the distance from P to C is \(\sqrt{5}\).

What should we do next?
Teacher: Great work so far! Now that we have the three distances:

• PA = 2√5  
• PB = 5  
• PC = √5  

The next step is to sum these distances. Can you add them together and express the total in the form m + n√5, where m and n are integers? Please show your work.
Student: To find the total distance from point P to the vertices A, B, and C, we need to sum the three distances we calculated:

1. Distance from P to A: \( PA = 2\sqrt{5} \)
2. Distance from P to B: \( PB = 5 \)
3. Distance from P to C: \( PC = \sqrt{5} \)

Now, we can add these distances together:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = PA + PB + PC = 2\sqrt{5} + 5 + \sqrt{5}
\]

We can combine the terms involving \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
\text{Total Distance} = (2\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{5}) + 5 = 3\sqrt{5} + 5
\]

Now, we can express this in the form \( m + n\sqrt{5} \):

- Here, \( m = 5 \) and \( n = 3 \).

Finally, we need to calculate \( m + n \):

\[
m + n = 5 + 3 = 8
\]

So, the final answer is \( \boxed{8} \).
Teacher: Excellent work! You correctly computed the distances as follows:

• PA = 2√5  
• PB = 5  
• PC = √5  

Then you summed them: 2√5 + 5 + √5 = 3√5 + 5, which matches the form m + n√5 with m = 5 and n = 3. Therefore, m + n = 5 + 3 = 8.

Your final answer is 8$
