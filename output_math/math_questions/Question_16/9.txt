Question: The first term of a geometric sequence is 729, and the 7th term is 64. What is the positive, real value for the 5th term?
3o-mini: In a geometric sequence, each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio, r. The nth term is given by:

  aₙ = a₁ · r^(n - 1)

We are given that a₁ = 729 and a₇ = 64. Plugging into the formula for the 7th term:

  a₇ = 729 · r^(7 - 1) = 729 · r⁶ = 64

To solve for r, divide both sides by 729:

  r⁶ = 64 ÷ 729

Notice that 64 = 2⁶ and 729 = 3⁶, so:

  r⁶ = (2/3)⁶

Taking the sixth root of both sides gives:

  r = 2/3

Now, we need to find the 5th term, a₅:

  a₅ = a₁ · r^(5 - 1) = 729 · r⁴

Substitute r = 2/3:

  a₅ = 729 · (2/3)⁴ = 729 · (16/81)

Simplify the multiplication:

  729 ÷ 81 = 9

Thus:

  a₅ = 9 · 16 = 144

The positive, real value for the 5th term is 144.
