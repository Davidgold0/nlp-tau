Question: The first term of a geometric sequence is 729, and the 7th term is 64. What is the positive, real value for the 5th term?
3o-mini: We are given a geometric sequence where the first term a₁ = 729 and the 7th term a₇ = 64. In a geometric sequence, the nth term is given by:

  aₙ = a₁ × r^(n - 1)

For the 7th term:

  a₇ = 729 × r^(7 - 1) = 729 × r⁶ = 64

To solve for r:

  r⁶ = 64 / 729

Recognize that 64 = 2⁶ and 729 = 3⁶, so:

  r⁶ = (2/3)⁶

Taking the sixth root of both sides (and considering the positive real value):

  r = 2/3

Now, to find the 5th term:

  a₅ = a₁ × r^(5 - 1) = 729 × (2/3)⁴

Calculate (2/3)⁴:

  (2/3)⁴ = 16 / 81

Now multiply:

  a₅ = 729 × (16 / 81) = (729 / 81) × 16

Since 729 ÷ 81 = 9:

  a₅ = 9 × 16 = 144

Thus, the positive, real value for the 5th term is 144.
