Question: One year ago, the number of years in Jane's age was a perfect square, and one year from now, her age will be a perfect cube. How many years old is Jane?
3o-mini: Let Jane's current age be A. According to the problem:

• One year ago, her age was a perfect square. This means A – 1 = x², for some integer x.
• One year from now, her age will be a perfect cube. This means A + 1 = y³, for some integer y.

We can write these as:
  A = x² + 1   (1)
  A = y³ – 1   (2)

Setting (1) and (2) equal gives:
  x² + 1 = y³ – 1  
  x² = y³ – 2

We now look for small integers x and y that satisfy this equation. Try y = 2 first:
  y³ = 8  → x² = 8 – 2 = 6  but 6 isn't a perfect square.

Next, try y = 3:
  y³ = 27  → x² = 27 – 2 = 25  x = 5 (since 25 is 5²), which works!

Now, substitute back:
  A = x² + 1 = 25 + 1 = 26  
  or  A = y³ – 1 = 27 – 1 = 26

Thus, Jane is 26 years old.
