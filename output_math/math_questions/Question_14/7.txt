Question: One year ago, the number of years in Jane's age was a perfect square, and one year from now, her age will be a perfect cube. How many years old is Jane?
3o-mini: Let Jane's current age be x.

According to the problem:
• One year ago, her age was a perfect square. That is, x - 1 = some perfect square.
• One year from now, her age will be a perfect cube. That is, x + 1 = some perfect cube.

Let x - 1 = s² and x + 1 = c³, for some integers s and c.

Since x + 1 - (x - 1) = 2, we have c³ - s² = 2.

Now, we test small perfect cubes:
• If c = 2, then c³ = 8 and x + 1 = 8. This gives x = 7, and so x - 1 = 6, which is not a perfect square.
• If c = 3, then c³ = 27 and x + 1 = 27. This gives x = 26, and so x - 1 = 25, which is 5² (a perfect square).

Thus, Jane's current age is 26 years old.
