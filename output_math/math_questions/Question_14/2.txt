Question: One year ago, the number of years in Jane's age was a perfect square, and one year from now, her age will be a perfect cube. How many years old is Jane?
Teacher: Let's start by rephrasing the problem in our own words. We need to find Jane’s current age (let’s call it x) with the following conditions:

• One year ago, her age was a perfect square. This means x – 1 is a perfect square.
• One year from now, her age will be a perfect cube. This means x + 1 is a perfect cube.

A good way to set up the problem is to introduce two integer variables. For example, let n be an integer such that:

  x – 1 = n²

Similarly, let m be an integer such that:

  x + 1 = m³

Now we have a system where the two expressions for x must be consistent. 

To guide us further, try to relate these two equations. For instance, subtracting the first from the second gives an equation involving m³ and n².

Please solve the next step: Write the equation you get when you subtract (x – 1 = n²) from (x + 1 = m³) and simplify it as much as possible.
Student: Sure! Let's start with the two equations we have:

1. \( x - 1 = n^2 \) 
2. \( x + 1 = m^3 \)

Now, if we subtract the first equation from the second, we get:

\[
(x + 1) - (x - 1) = m^3 - n^2
\]

Simplifying the left side gives us:

\[
x + 1 - x + 1 = m^3 - n^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2 = m^3 - n^2
\]

So the equation we have after subtracting is:

\[
m^3 - n^2 = 2
\]

Would you like me to proceed with solving for \( m \) and \( n \) based on this equation?
Teacher: Great job! Your subtraction and simplification are correct: we obtained m³ – n² = 2.

Now for the next step, let’s try to find integer values for m and n that satisfy this equation. To do this, consider small positive integers for m and determine if there exists a corresponding integer n.

For example, start by testing m = 2:
 • Compute m³, then use the equation m³ – n² = 2 to find n².
 • Is n² a perfect square when m = 2?

Please work on this step and let me know what you find for m = 2.
Student: Sure! Let's start by testing \( m = 2 \):

1. Compute \( m^3 \):
   \[
   m^3 = 2^3 = 8
   \]

2. Now, substitute this value into the equation \( m^3 - n^2 = 2 \):
   \[
   8 - n^2 = 2
   \]

3. Rearranging this gives us:
   \[
   n^2 = 8 - 2 = 6
   \]

Now, we need to check if \( n^2 = 6 \) is a perfect square. The square root of 6 is not an integer, so \( n^2 = 6 \) is not a perfect square.

Next, let's try the next integer value for \( m \), which is \( m = 3 \). 

1. Compute \( m^3 \):
   \[
   m^3 = 3^3 = 27
   \]

2. Substitute this value into the equation:
   \[
   27 - n^2 = 2
   \]

3. Rearranging gives:
   \[
   n^2 = 27 - 2 = 25
   \]

Now, we check if \( n^2 = 25 \) is a perfect square. Since \( n = 5 \) is an integer, this works!

So we have:
- \( m = 3 \) and \( n = 5 \).

Would you like me to proceed to find Jane's current age using these values?
Teacher: Great work finding m = 3 and n = 5! Now, let's move on to the next step. We have the following equations from earlier:

 • x – 1 = n²  
 • x + 1 = m³  

Since you found n = 5 and m = 3, please use one of these equations to solve for Jane’s current age, x. What value do you get for x?
Student: Sure! Let's use the equation \( x - 1 = n^2 \) to find Jane's current age.

We know that \( n = 5 \), so we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[
x - 1 = 5^2
\]

Calculating \( 5^2 \):

\[
x - 1 = 25
\]

Now, to find \( x \), we add 1 to both sides:

\[
x = 25 + 1 = 26
\]

So, Jane's current age is \( \boxed{26} \) years old. Would you like me to check if this age satisfies both conditions from the original problem?
Teacher: Great work! Before we finalize our work, let’s revisit the last step to ensure everything is fully verified. You substituted n = 5 into x – 1 = n² and correctly solved for x = 26. Now, please verify that Jane’s age meets both original conditions:

1. One year ago, she was 26 – 1 = 25, which should be a perfect square.
2. One year from now, she will be 26 + 1 = 27, which should be a perfect cube.

Can you walk through this verification step by step?
Student: Of course! Let's verify both conditions step by step.

1. **One year ago**: Jane's age was \( 26 - 1 = 25 \).
   - We need to check if 25 is a perfect square. The square root of 25 is 5, which is an integer. Therefore, 25 is indeed a perfect square.

2. **One year from now**: Jane's age will be \( 26 + 1 = 27 \).
   - We need to check if 27 is a perfect cube. The cube root of 27 is 3, which is also an integer. Thus, 27 is a perfect cube.

Since both conditions are satisfied:
- One year ago, Jane was 25 (a perfect square).
- One year from now, she will be 27 (a perfect cube).

This confirms that Jane's current age of \( \boxed{26} \) is correct! Thank you for guiding me through the problem!
Teacher: Excellent verification! You've shown that one year ago Jane was 25 (a perfect square) and one year from now she will be 27 (a perfect cube). 

The final answer is: 26$
