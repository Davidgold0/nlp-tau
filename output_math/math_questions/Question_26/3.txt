Question: How many different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47?
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem together. The question asks: “How many different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47?” 

To break it down, consider these steps:
1. Recognize that if a counting number (let’s call it d) leaves a remainder of 5 when 47 is divided by it, then by the division algorithm we can write:
  47 = q·d + 5  (for some quotient q)
2. Rearranging the equation, subtract 5 from both sides to get:
  42 = q·d
3. This tells us that d must be a divisor of 42. However, because the remainder (which is 5) must be smaller than d, we also have the condition that d > 5.
4. So, the next task is to list all the divisors of 42 and then pick out those that are greater than 5.

To begin, please solve the next step: List all the divisors (factors) of 42. What list do you get?
Student: Sure! To find the divisors of 42, we can start by determining the numbers that can divide 42 without leaving a remainder. 

The divisors of 42 are:
1. 1
2. 2
3. 3
4. 6
5. 7
6. 14
7. 21
8. 42

So, the complete list of divisors of 42 is: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. 

Now, as per your guidance, I need to consider only those divisors that are greater than 5. Would you like me to list those now?
Teacher: Great work on listing all the divisors of 42 clearly! Now, let's move on to the next step in solving the problem. Remember, our task is to only consider those divisors that are greater than 5 (because the divisor must be larger than the remainder 5). 

Could you please list the divisors from your previous step that are greater than 5?
Student: Sure! From the list of divisors of 42 that I provided earlier, the ones that are greater than 5 are:

1. 6
2. 7
3. 14
4. 21
5. 42

So, the divisors of 42 that are greater than 5 are: 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. 

What should I do next?
Teacher: Great job listing the divisors greater than 5! Now, for the next step, we need to verify that these divisors indeed make sense in the context of the problem. Recall that for a divisor d to yield a remainder of 5 when dividing 47, 47 can be written as:

  47 = q·d + 5.

Since we rewrote the equation to 42 = q·d, each d in our list should divide 42 evenly. You've already ensured that by selecting divisors of 42 and then excluding those ≤ 5. 

Now, as our next step, please count how many numbers are in your list of divisors (6, 7, 14, 21, 42). How many counting numbers are there that will each leave a remainder of 5 when 47 is divided by them?
Student: Sure! From the list of divisors greater than 5, which are 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42, I can count them:

1. 6
2. 7
3. 14
4. 21
5. 42

There are a total of **5 counting numbers** that will each leave a remainder of 5 when 47 is divided by them. 

Is there anything else you would like me to do?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly determined that there are 5 counting numbers that leave a remainder of 5 when 47 is divided by them. The final answer is: 5$
