Question: How many different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47?
3o-mini: To solve the problem, we start by letting d be a divisor (a positive counting number) such that when 47 is divided by d, the remainder is 5. According to the division algorithm, we can represent this as:

  47 = q·d + 5

where q is the quotient. Rearranging, we obtain:

  47 - 5 = q·d
  42 = q·d

This tells us d must be a divisor of 42. However, there's an additional condition from the division algorithm: the remainder must be less than the divisor, meaning

  5 < d.

Now, we list the divisors of 42:

  1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42

Next, we only consider those divisors that are greater than 5:

  6, 7, 14, 21, 42

Counting these, we see there are 5 such divisors.

Thus, there are 5 different counting numbers (divisors) that, when used to divide 47, leave a remainder of 5.
