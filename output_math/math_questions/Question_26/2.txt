Question: How many different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47?
Teacher: Let's begin by rephrasing the problem in our own words: We need to find how many positive integers (counting numbers) d have the property that when 47 is divided by d, the remainder is 5.

To tackle this, one way to proceed is as follows:
1. Write an equation that represents the division with remainder. (Hint: the division algorithm tells us that if 47 divided by d gives a quotient q and remainder 5, then 47 = d × q + 5.)
2. Rearrange the equation, and notice that d must be a divisor of the difference (47 - 5).
3. Identify the condition that the divisor, d, must be larger than or equal to a certain number because the remainder is 5.
4. List the divisors of (47 - 5).
5. Count those divisors that satisfy the condition.

Now, let's start with the first step: Can you write down the equation according to the division algorithm that represents this situation and state any immediate observations regarding the remainder and divisor?
Student: Sure! According to the division algorithm, we can express the situation as:

\[ 47 = d \times q + 5 \]

where \( d \) is the divisor, \( q \) is the quotient, and 5 is the remainder. 

From this equation, we can rearrange it to find:

\[ 47 - 5 = d \times q \]
\[ 42 = d \times q \]

This tells us that \( d \) must be a divisor of 42. 

An immediate observation is that since the remainder is 5, the divisor \( d \) must be greater than 5 (because the remainder must always be less than the divisor). 

Now, the next step is to identify the divisors of 42. Would you like me to list those divisors?
Teacher: Great job! You've correctly set up the equation and deduced that d must be a divisor of 42, and that d must be greater than 5. Now, as the next step, can you list all the divisors of 42 and then identify which ones are greater than 5? Please share your work.
Student: Student: Sure! The divisors of 42 can be found by determining which numbers divide 42 without leaving a remainder. The divisors of 42 are:

1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42.

Now, let’s identify which of these divisors are greater than 5:

- 6
- 7
- 14
- 21
- 42

So, the divisors of 42 that are greater than 5 are 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. 

Next, would you like me to count how many of these divisors there are?
Teacher: You're doing great! You've correctly identified the divisors of 42 as 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42, and you've pinpointed that those greater than 5 are 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42.

Now, can you count how many divisors there are in your list (the ones that are greater than 5)? Just count them and share your answer along with a brief explanation.
Student: Sure! From the list of divisors greater than 5, we have:

- 6
- 7
- 14
- 21
- 42

Counting these, we find there are a total of 5 divisors that are greater than 5. 

So, the answer to the question of how many different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47 is **5**. 

This means there are 5 positive integers (6, 7, 14, 21, and 42) that satisfy the condition. Thank you for your guidance!
Teacher: You've done a great job working through the problem step by step! To summarize:

1. You set up the equation using the division algorithm as 47 = d × q + 5.
2. You rearranged to get 42 = d × q, meaning d must be a divisor of 42.
3. You correctly listed the divisors of 42: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42.
4. You recognized that since the remainder is 5, d must be greater than 5, resulting in d being one of 6, 7, 14, 21, or 42.
5. Finally, you counted these divisors and found there are 5 such divisors.

The final answer is 5$
