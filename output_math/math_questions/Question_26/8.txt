Question: How many different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47?
3o-mini: We are given that when 47 is divided by a counting number d, it leaves a remainder of 5. This means that for some positive integer quotient q, the division algorithm gives:

  47 = q·d + 5

Subtract 5 from both sides to obtain:

  42 = q·d

This tells us that d is a divisor of 42. However, note that in the division algorithm the remainder must be less than the divisor; hence we require:

  5 < d

Now, list the positive divisors of 42:

  1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42

Select only those divisors that are greater than 5:

  6, 7, 14, 21, 42

There are 5 such divisors. Therefore, there are 5 different counting numbers that, when dividing 47, leave a remainder of 5.
