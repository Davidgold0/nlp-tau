Question: Let $S$ be the increasing sequence of positive integers whose binary representation has exactly $8$ ones. Let $N$ be the 1000th number in $S$. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.
3o-mini: We are given that S is an increasing sequence of all positive integers whose binary representation has exactly 8 ones. In other words, S is the list of numbers n for which the number of ones in the binary expansion of n equals 8. We wish to find the 1000th number in this list (call it N) and then compute N mod 1000.

Step 1. Count Numbers by Bit‐Length

Any positive integer’s binary representation has a certain number of bits. If an integer has n bits then its highest (leftmost) bit is 1. For such an n‐bit number to have exactly 8 ones, the highest bit is fixed as 1 and we must choose 7 additional ones among the remaining n – 1 bits. Hence, for a given n the count is

  C(n – 1, 7).

Count for small n:
 • n = 8: C(7, 7) = 1.
 • n = 9: C(8, 7) = 8.
 • n = 10: C(9, 7) = C(9, 2) = 36.
 • n = 11: C(10, 7) = C(10, 3) = 120.
 • n = 12: C(11, 7) = C(11, 4) = 330.
 • n = 13: C(12, 7) = C(12, 5) = 792.

Now, add these counts cumulatively:
 – Up to 8 bits: 1
 – Up to 9 bits: 1 + 8 = 9
 – Up to 10 bits: 9 + 36 = 45
 – Up to 11 bits: 45 + 120 = 165
 – Up to 12 bits: 165 + 330 = 495
 – Up to 13 bits: 495 + 792 = 1287

Since the cumulative count exceeds 1000 only when we reach 13‐bit numbers (495 numbers have fewer than 13 bits), the 1000th number lies among the 13‐bit numbers. In fact, it is the (1000 – 495) = 505th 13‐bit number that has exactly 8 ones.

Step 2. Locate the 505th 13−bit Number with 8 Ones

A 13−bit number has bits b12, b11, …, b0 with b12 = 1. Besides b12, we must choose 7 ones among the lower 12 positions. We can think of forming a binary string for positions 11 down to 0 with exactly 7 ones. The numbers in S are listed in increasing order. In the binary number the more “left” ones (i.e. in higher positions) the larger the number. Equivalently, while constructing the binary string from bit 11 down to bit 0, we decide at each step whether that bit is 0 or 1 by “counting” how many configurations remain if we choose 0.

Define:
 r = the number of positions remaining (starting with r = 12 for positions 11 down to 0),
 t = the number of ones left to place (starting with t = 7),
 k = the rank we want among these strings (initially k = 505).

Now process each bit from position 11 down to 0:

1. Position 11:
 • If we set b11 = 0, then we must place 7 ones in the remaining 11 positions. This can be done in C(11, 7) = 330 ways.
 • Since 330 < k = 505, the 505th number is not in those configurations. So we set b11 = 1.
 • Subtract the 330 “skipped” numbers: new k = 505 – 330 = 175.
 • Decrease ones needed: t becomes 6.
 • r becomes 11.

2. Position 10:
 • With r = 11 and t = 6, if b10 = 0 then there are C(10, 6) = C(10, 4) = 210 configurations.
 • Since 210 ≥ k = 175, we set b10 = 0.
 • (k remains 175, t stays 6, and r becomes 10.)

3. Position 9:
 • Now r = 10, t = 6. If b9 = 0 then there are C(9, 6) = C(9, 3) = 84 configurations.
 • Since 84 < k = 175, we set b9 = 1.
 • Subtract 84: new k = 175 – 84 = 91.
 • Now t becomes 5 and r becomes 9.

4. Position 8:
 • r = 9, t = 5. If b8 = 0 then number of ways = C(8, 5) = C(8, 3) = 56.
 • Since 56 < k = 91, we set b8 = 1.
 • Subtract 56: new k = 91 – 56 = 35.
 • Now t becomes 4 and r becomes 8.

5. Position 7:
 • r = 8, t = 4. If b7 = 0 then ways = C(7, 4) = 35.
 • Here, k = 35, and since k ≤ 35, we choose b7 = 0.
 • (k remains 35, t stays 4, r becomes 7.)

6. Position 6:
 • r = 7, t = 4. If b6 = 0 then ways = C(6, 4) = 15.
 • Since 15 < k = 35, we set b6 = 1.
 • Subtract 15: new k = 35 – 15 = 20.
 • Now t becomes 3 and r becomes 6.

7. Position 5:
 • r = 6, t = 3. If b5 = 0 then ways = C(5, 3) = 10.
 • Since 10 < k = 20, we set b5 = 1.
 • Subtract 10: new k = 20 – 10 = 10.
 • Now t becomes 2 and r becomes 5.

8. Position 4:
 • r = 5, t = 2. If b4 = 0 then ways = C(4, 2) = 6.
 • Since 6 < k = 10, we set b4 = 1.
 • Subtract 6: new k = 10 – 6 = 4.
 • Now t becomes 1 and r becomes 4.

9. Position 3:
 • r = 4, t = 1. If b3 = 0 then ways = C(3, 1) = 3.
 • Since 3 < k = 4, we set b3 = 1.
 • Subtract 3: new k = 4 – 3 = 1.
 • Now t becomes 0 and r becomes 3.

10. For positions 2, 1, and 0:
 • Since t = 0 (no more ones to place), we set b2 = b1 = b0 = 0.

Now, reassemble the bits:
 - b12 is the fixed leftmost bit of a 13–bit number: 1.
 - b11 = 1
 - b10 = 0
 - b9 = 1
 - b8 = 1
 - b7 = 0
 - b6 = 1
 - b5 = 1
 - b4 = 1
 - b3 = 1
 - b2 = 0
 - b1 = 0
 - b0 = 0

Thus the binary representation is: 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0.

Step 3. Convert to Decimal and Compute Modulo 1000

Now compute the value:
 N = 2^12 + 2^11 + 0 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 0 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 0 + 0 + 0.
Calculate each power:
 2^12 = 4096
 2^11 = 2048
 2^9 = 512
 2^8 = 256
 2^6 = 64
 2^5 = 32
 2^4 = 16
 2^3 = 8

Now sum:
 4096 + 2048 = 6144
 6144 + 512 = 6656
 6656 + 256 = 6912
 6912 + 64 = 6976
 6976 + 32 = 7008
 7008 + 16 = 7024
 7024 + 8 = 7032

So, N = 7032. Finally, compute N mod 1000:

 7032 mod 1000 = 32.

Thus, the remainder when N is divided by 1000 is 32.
