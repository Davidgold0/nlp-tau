Question: Let $S$ be the increasing sequence of positive integers whose binary representation has exactly $8$ ones. Let $N$ be the 1000th number in $S$. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.
3o-mini: We wish to find the 1000th positive integer whose binary representation has exactly 8 ones. Call this number N and then compute N mod 1000.

Step 1. Count by bit‐length

A positive integer with exactly 8 ones must have at least 8 binary digits. (In fact, the only 8–digit number is 11111111₂ = 255.) In general, if an integer has k binary digits it must have a 1 as the leftmost digit. Then the remaining k – 1 digits must contribute the other 7 ones. (For k < 8 there’s no possibility; for k = 8 the count is 1: all bits 1.)

For a k–digit binary number (k ≥ 8) with exactly 8 ones the number is counted by choosing 7 ones among the remaining k – 1 places. So the count is

  C(k – 1, 7).

Now, count how many terms in the sequence have fewer than 13 digits:

• k = 8: C(7, 7) = 1  
• k = 9: C(8, 7) = 8  
• k = 10: C(9, 7) = 36  
• k = 11: C(10, 7) = 120  
• k = 12: C(11, 7) = 330  

Cumulative count up through 12–digit numbers = 1 + 8 + 36 + 120 + 330 = 495.

Since 495 < 1000, the 1000th number falls among the 13–digit numbers. For 13–digit numbers, the count is
  C(12, 7) = 792.
Within the 13–digit group, the 1000th number overall is the (1000 – 495) = 505th smallest 13–digit number with exactly 8 ones.

Step 2. Find the 505th number in the 13–digit group

All numbers in this group have 13 binary digits; the most significant bit is fixed as 1. Writing N in binary we have

  N = 1 b₁₁ b₁₀ ⋯ b₀   (with positions numbered 12 (MSB) down to 0),
and in the remaining 12 bits (positions 11 to 0) we must place exactly 7 ones (since one “1” is already at position 12).

Our task is to “construct” the 12–bit string (of length 12 having exactly 7 ones) that is the 505th in increasing (numerical, which coincides with lexicographic) order. To do so, we use the following greedy procedure. Let f(n, k) = C(n, k) denote the number of ways to choose k ones in n bits.

Initialize:
 n = 12 (remaining positions),
 k = 7 (ones to place),
 rank = 505.

Now consider the bits one by one from the most significant (position 11) down to the least (position 0).

1. Position 11:
 Option “0”: then there are f(11, 7) = C(11, 7) = 330 possibilities.
 Since 330 < rank (505), the wanted string is not among these.
 Thus, set bit11 = 1.
 Update: Subtract skipped 330 patterns → rank becomes 505 – 330 = 175.
 Also, one “1” is used so now k = 6 and remaining positions n = 11.

2. Position 10:
 Option “0”: Count becomes f(10, 6) = C(10, 6) = C(10,4) = 210.
 Because 210 ≥ 175, we choose 0 here.
 So, bit10 = 0, with n = 10, k remains 6, and rank remains 175.

3. Position 9:
 Option “0”: Count = f(9, 6) = C(9, 6) = C(9, 3) = 84.
 Since 84 < 175, skip these.
 Thus, set bit9 = 1.
 Update: rank = 175 – 84 = 91, k = 5, n = 9.

4. Position 8:
 Option “0”: Count = f(8, 5) = C(8, 5) = C(8, 3) = 56.
 Since 56 < 91, skip these.
 So, set bit8 = 1.
 Update: rank = 91 – 56 = 35, k = 4, n = 8.

5. Position 7:
 Option “0”: Count = f(7, 4) = C(7, 4) = 35.
 Now, rank = 35 is exactly equal to this count, meaning that the 35th string in the block beginning with 0 here is our target.
 Thus, choose bit7 = 0.
 Update: n = 7, k remains 4, rank stays 35.

6. Position 6:
 Option “0”: Count = f(6, 4) = C(6, 4) = C(6, 2) = 15.
 Since 15 < 35, skip.
 Therefore, set bit6 = 1.
 Update: rank = 35 – 15 = 20, k becomes 3, n = 6.

7. Position 5:
 Option “0”: Count = f(5, 3) = C(5, 3) = 10.
 Since 10 < 20, skip.
 So, set bit5 = 1.
 Update: rank = 20 – 10 = 10, k = 2, n = 5.

8. Position 4:
 Option “0”: Count = f(4, 2) = C(4, 2) = 6.
 Since 6 < 10, skip.
 Set bit4 = 1.
 Update: rank = 10 – 6 = 4, k becomes 1, n = 4.

9. Position 3:
 Option “0”: Count = f(3, 1) = C(3, 1) = 3.
 Since 3 < 4, skip.
 Thus, set bit3 = 1.
 Update: rank = 4 – 3 = 1, k becomes 0, n = 3.

Since k = 0 now, the remaining bits (positions 2, 1, 0) must all be 0.

Thus, the 12–bit string (positions 11 to 0) is:
 bit11 = 1
 bit10 = 0
 bit9  = 1
 bit8  = 1
 bit7  = 0
 bit6  = 1
 bit5  = 1
 bit4  = 1
 bit3  = 1
 bit2 = 0
 bit1 = 0
 bit0 = 0.

Recalling that the full 13–bit number has a leading 1 at position 12, we have:

Positions: 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0  
Bits:    1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0

Step 3. Convert to Decimal and Take Remainder Modulo 1000

Write N as a sum of powers of 2:
 N = 2¹² + 2¹¹ + 0·2¹⁰ + 2⁹ + 2⁸ + 0·2⁷ + 2⁶ + 2⁵ + 2⁴ + 2³ + 0·2² + 0·2¹ + 0·2⁰.

Calculate each term:
 2¹² = 4096  
 2¹¹ = 2048  
 2⁹ = 512  
 2⁸ = 256  
 2⁶ = 64  
 2⁵ = 32  
 2⁴ = 16  
 2³ = 8

Now sum them:
 4096 + 2048 = 6144  
 6144 + 512 = 6656  
 6656 + 256 = 6912  
 6912 + 64 = 6976  
 6976 + 32 = 7008  
 7008 + 16 = 7024  
 7024 + 8 = 7032

Thus, N = 7032.

Taking the remainder when 7032 is divided by 1000 gives:
 7032 mod 1000 = 32.

Answer: The remainder is 32.
