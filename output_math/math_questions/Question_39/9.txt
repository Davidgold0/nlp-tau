Question: Let $S$ be the increasing sequence of positive integers whose binary representation has exactly $8$ ones. Let $N$ be the 1000th number in $S$. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.
3o-mini: We wish to list, in increasing order, all positive integers whose binary representation has exactly 8 ones. Let S be that sequence, and let N be its 1000th element. We will find N modulo 1000.

Step 1. Count numbers by binary length.

Any positive integer has a unique binary representation with a certain number of bits. If an integer has m bits (so its most‐significant bit is in position m – 1) and its binary representation contains exactly 8 ones, then because the top bit is fixed to 1, we must choose the remaining 7 ones from the other m – 1 bits. Hence for m-bit numbers the count is

  C(m – 1, 7).

We must have m ≥ 8 (since with m < 8 we cannot have 8 ones).

Now compute counts:
 • For m = 8: C(7, 7) = 1.
 • For m = 9: C(8, 7) = 8.
 • For m = 10: C(9, 7) = 36.
 • For m = 11: C(10, 7) = 120.
 • For m = 12: C(11, 7) = 330.
 • For m = 13: C(12, 7) = 792.

Find cumulative totals:
 m = 8: total = 1.
 m = 9: total = 1 + 8 = 9.
 m = 10: total = 9 + 36 = 45.
 m = 11: total = 45 + 120 = 165.
 m = 12: total = 165 + 330 = 495.
 m = 13: total = 495 + 792 = 1287.

Since 495 < 1000 ≤ 1287, the 1000th number appears among the 13–bit numbers.
That is, N is a 13–bit number (i.e. between 4096 and 8191) whose binary representation has 8 ones.

Step 2. Locate the 1000th number among the 13–bit numbers.

Among numbers with 13 bits, the most–significant bit (bit position 12) is 1. The remaining 12 bits must contain exactly 7 ones (since 1 is already used). There are C(12, 7) = 792 such numbers. In our overall count, the numbers of length up through 12 bits total 495. Hence N is the (1000 – 495) = 505th number among the 13–bit numbers (when ordered in increasing order).

Step 3. Finding the 505th number among 13–bit numbers with exactly 8 ones.

Let’s denote the 13–bit number N as

  N = 2^12 + M,

where M is a 12–bit number (possibly with leading zeros) that has exactly 7 ones. Our goal is to find the 505th smallest M among all 12–bit numbers that have exactly 7 ones. We use a “greedy” digit-by-digit (bit-by-bit) method.

Let the 12 bits of M be b₁₁, b₁₀, …, b₀ (with b₁₁ the most–significant of these 12 bits). We want to choose these bits so that there are exactly 7 ones. We will process from b₁₁ (position 11) down to b₀, keeping track of:
 • r, the rank we need (initially r = 505),
 • k, the number of ones we still need (initially k = 7),
 • and n, the number of bit positions remaining.

At each step, we decide whether to put a 0 or a 1 in the current position based on the number of sequences available.

Notation: f(n, k) = C(n, k) = number of ways to choose k ones among n bits.

Now, step by step:

1. Position 11 (n = 12 available positions at start):
 Option if b₁₁ = 0: then the remaining (11 bits) must have k = 7 ones.
  Count = C(11, 7) = 330.
 Since 505 > 330, the 505th number is not in this block.
 Thus we set b₁₁ = 1.
 Update: subtract 330 from r: r becomes 505 – 330 = 175.
 Remaining ones needed: k becomes 7 – 1 = 6.
 Remaining positions: 11.

2. Position 10:
 Option if b₁₀ = 0: then count = C(10, 6) = 210.
 Since r = 175 ≤ 210, we choose b₁₀ = 0 (stay in the first block).
 No subtraction.
 Remaining: k = 6, positions left = 10, r = 175.

3. Position 9:
 Option if b₉ = 0: then count = C(9, 6) = C(9, 3) = 84.
 Since 175 > 84, choose b₉ = 1.
 Subtract 84: r becomes 175 – 84 = 91.
 Update: k becomes 6 – 1 = 5.
 Remaining positions = 9.

4. Position 8:
 Option if b₈ = 0: then count = C(8, 5) = C(8, 3) = 56.
 Since 91 > 56, choose b₈ = 1.
 Subtract 56: r becomes 91 – 56 = 35.
 Update: k becomes 5 – 1 = 4.
 Remaining positions = 8.

5. Position 7:
 Option if b₇ = 0: then count = C(7, 4) = 35.
 Now r = 35, and since 35 ≤ 35, we choose b₇ = 0.
 No subtraction.
 Remaining: k = 4, positions = 7, r = 35.

6. Position 6:
 Option if b₆ = 0: then count = C(6, 4) = C(6, 2) = 15.
 Since 35 > 15, choose b₆ = 1.
 Subtract 15: r becomes 35 – 15 = 20.
 Update: k becomes 4 – 1 = 3.
 Remaining positions = 6.

7. Position 5:
 Option if b₅ = 0: then count = C(5, 3) = 10.
 Since 20 > 10, choose b₅ = 1.
 Subtract 10: r becomes 20 – 10 = 10.
 Update: k becomes 3 – 1 = 2.
 Remaining positions = 5.

8. Position 4:
 Option if b₄ = 0: then count = C(4, 2) = 6.
 Since 10 > 6, choose b₄ = 1.
 Subtract 6: r becomes 10 – 6 = 4.
 Update: k becomes 2 – 1 = 1.
 Remaining positions = 4.

9. Position 3:
 Option if b₃ = 0: then count = C(3, 1) = 3.
 Since 4 > 3, choose b₃ = 1.
 Subtract 3: r becomes 4 – 3 = 1.
 Update: k becomes 1 – 1 = 0.
 Remaining positions = 3.

10. Positions 2, 1, 0:
 Since we need 0 more ones, set all remaining bits to 0.

Now we record the choices for M (the 12 bits, positions 11 down to 0):

 Position:  11  10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
 Bit:     1   0  1  1  0  1  1  1  1  0  0  0

Let’s verify the count of ones:
 Ones at positions 11, 9, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3 → 7 ones, as required.

Step 4. Convert M to its decimal value.

M = 2^11 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3
   = 2048 + 512 + 256 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8.
Compute the sum step‐by‐step:
 2048 + 512 = 2560,
 2560 + 256 = 2816,
 2816 + 64 = 2880,
 2880 + 32 = 2912,
 2912 + 16 = 2928,
 2928 + 8 = 2936.

Now recall N = 2^12 + M. Since 2^12 = 4096,
 N = 4096 + 2936 = 7032.

Step 5. Find N modulo 1000.

7032 modulo 1000 equals 32.

Thus, the remainder when the 1000th number in S is divided by 1000 is 32.

Answer: 32.
