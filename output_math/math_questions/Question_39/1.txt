Question: Let $S$ be the increasing sequence of positive integers whose binary representation has exactly $8$ ones. Let $N$ be the 1000th number in $S$. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.
Teacher: Let's break this problem down into steps. Remember, I won’t give away the complete solution, but I’ll help you navigate through one step at a time.

The problem asks us to find the 1000th positive integer (call it N) whose binary representation contains exactly 8 ones, and then compute N mod 1000.

One natural approach is to:
1. Determine how many numbers with exactly 8 ones exist with a fixed binary length (number of digits). Note that for any positive integer with k binary digits, the leading digit is 1, so the remaining k – 1 positions must contribute the remaining 7 ones. This gives us C(k – 1, 7) numbers for each k-digit binary number.
2. Start with k = 8 (since you need at least 8 digits to have 8 ones) and then sum C(k – 1, 7) for successive k values until that cumulative sum reaches or exceeds 1000. This will identify the length of the binary numbers in which the 1000th number falls.
3. Once you know the binary length (say k digits) where the 1000th number lies, determine its exact position within that group.
4. Finally, find the binary representation of that number and then compute its remainder when divided by 1000.

Let’s start with the first part:

Step 1: Determine the number of k-digit binary numbers with exactly 8 ones. For a given k (starting from k = 8), these numbers count as C(k – 1, 7). Could you please work out the values of C(k – 1, 7) for k starting at 8 and then add them cumulatively until you reach or exceed 1000? 

Please show your work for the computation of these combinations and the running total.
Student: Sure! Let's start by calculating the values of \( C(k - 1, 7) \) for \( k \) starting from 8 and then add them cumulatively until we reach or exceed 1000.

1. **For \( k = 8 \)**:
   \[
   C(8 - 1, 7) = C(7, 7) = 1
   \]

2. **For \( k = 9 \)**:
   \[
   C(9 - 1, 7) = C(8, 7) = 8
   \]

3. **For \( k = 10 \)**:
   \[
   C(10 - 1, 7) = C(9, 7) = 36
   \]

4. **For \( k = 11 \)**:
   \[
   C(11 - 1, 7) = C(10, 7) = 120
   \]

5. **For \( k = 12 \)**:
   \[
   C(12 - 1, 7) = C(11, 7) = 330
   \]

6. **For \( k = 13 \)**:
   \[
   C(13 - 1, 7) = C(12, 7) = 792
   \]

7. **For \( k = 14 \)**:
   \[
   C(14 - 1, 7) = C(13, 7) = 1716
   \]

Now, let's sum these values cumulatively:

- For \( k = 8 \): Total = \( 1 \)
- For \( k = 9 \): Total = \( 1 + 8 = 9 \)
- For \( k = 10 \): Total = \( 9 + 36 = 45 \)
- For \( k = 11 \): Total = \( 45 + 120 = 165 \)
- For \( k = 12 \): Total = \( 165 + 330 = 495 \)
- For \( k = 13 \): Total = \( 495 + 792 = 1287 \)

At this point, we see that the cumulative total reaches 1287 when \( k = 13 \), which exceeds 1000. 

Next, we can see that the 1000th number is within the sequence of numbers that have 13 binary digits. To find its exact position within this group, we need to determine how many numbers there are with 12 digits (which is 495).

Since \( 1000 - 495 = 505 \), the 1000th number is the 505th number in the sequence of numbers with 13 binary digits that have exactly 8 ones.

Would you like me to proceed with finding the 505th number with 13 binary digits and exactly 8 ones?
Teacher: Great work on the first step! You correctly computed the cumulative totals and determined that the 1000th number lies among the 13‐digit binary numbers. In fact, since there are 495 numbers with exactly 8 ones in representations with up to 12 digits, the 1000th number is the 505th number in the list of 13‐digit numbers that have exactly 8 ones.

Now, let’s move on to the next step:

Step 2: We need to determine the exact binary representation of the 505th number among the 13-digit numbers with exactly 8 ones. Recall that every such number has a 1 as the leftmost digit (because 13-digit numbers in binary always start with 1). So the remaining 12 positions must have exactly 7 ones. We can think of constructing the binary string one bit at a time—from the second digit to the 13th—using combinatorial counts to decide whether each position should be 0 or 1. At each position, consider: “If I place a 0 here versus a 1 here, how many valid completions (combinations) remain?” Compare that count with the target index (here, 505) to decide whether your number should have a 0 or a 1 at that position.

Could you please work on this next step? Try to determine, for the second position, whether it should be 0 or 1 using the combination counts and explain your reasoning for that bit. (Remember, we’re only tackling the very next bit.)
Student: Sure! Let's determine the second bit of the binary representation of the 505th number among the 13-digit numbers with exactly 8 ones.

Since we already know that the first bit must be 1 (because we are dealing with 13-digit binary numbers), we now focus on the bits from the second position to the 13th position, which need to contain exactly 7 ones in total.

**Step 1: Analyze the second position**

- If we place a **0** in the second position, we have 11 remaining positions (from the 3rd to the 13th) to place the remaining 7 ones. The number of ways to do this is given by:
  \[
  C(11, 7) = C(11, 4) = \frac{11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 330
  \]

- If we place a **1** in the second position, then we have 10 remaining positions (from the 3rd to the 12th) to place the remaining 6 ones. The number of ways to do this is given by:
  \[
  C(10, 6) = C(10, 4) = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 210
  \]

**Step 2: Compare the counts**

Now we need to compare the counts with our target index (505):
- If the second bit is **0**, we can form **330** valid combinations. This means that the numbers formed with the second bit as 0 will occupy positions 1 through 330.
- If the second bit is **1**, we can form **210** valid combinations, which will occupy positions 331 through 540.

Since \( 505 \) falls within the range of 331 to 540, this indicates that the second bit must be **1**.

**Current Binary Representation:**
- So far, we have determined that the binary representation starts with **11**.

Now, we have used 2 ones, and we still need to place 6 ones in the remaining 11 positions (from the 3rd to the 13th). 

Shall I proceed to determine the next bit (the third position) using the same method?
Teacher: Your reasoning for the second bit is excellent! You correctly compared the counts for a 0 versus a 1 and deduced that the second bit should be 1. Now our binary string starts with "11". This means we’ve already placed 2 ones, so we need to place 6 more ones in the remaining 11 positions. Also, since the total combinations for a 0 at position 2 was 330, and we were targeting the 505th number overall within the 13‑digit numbers, the new target index for the remainder (with the prefix "11") becomes 505 – 330 = 175.

Now, let’s move to the next step:

Step 2 (continued): Determine the third bit (i.e. position 3) using a similar combinatorial method. With the prefix "11", we have:
• 11 positions remaining with exactly 6 ones to place.
• Ask: If at position 3 we put a 0, how many completions (i.e., valid binary strings for the remaining positions with 6 ones) exist? And if we put a 1, how many completions?
Remember, if you choose 0 at position 3, then in the remaining 10 positions you must place 6 ones. If you choose 1 at position 3, then you'll have one additional one already and you'll need to place 5 ones in the remaining 10 positions.

Could you please calculate these two counts (i.e. C(10,6) and C(10,5)) and decide whether the third bit should be 0 or 1 based on the target index of 175? Please explain your reasoning for this step.
Student: Sure! Let's calculate the number of valid binary strings that can be formed based on the third position (position 3) of our binary representation, which currently starts as "11". 

### Current Situation:
- We have placed 2 ones ("11"), and we need to place 6 more ones in the remaining 11 positions (from position 3 to position 13).
- Our target index for the remaining combinations is now 175 (since we have already accounted for the first 330 combinations that start with "10").

### Step 1: Analyze the third position

1. **If we place a **0** in the third position**:
   - We have 10 remaining positions (from position 4 to position 13) to place the remaining 6 ones.
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(10, 6) = C(10, 4) = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 210
   \]

2. **If we place a **1** in the third position**:
   - We will have 9 remaining positions (from position 4 to position 12) to place the remaining 5 ones.
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(9, 5) = C(9, 4) = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 126
   \]

### Step 2: Compare the counts

Now, we need to compare the counts with our target index (175):
- If the third bit is **0**, we can form **210** valid combinations. This means that the numbers formed with the third bit as 0 will occupy positions 1 through 210.
- If the third bit is **1**, we can form **126** valid combinations, which will occupy positions 211 through 336.

Since \( 175 \) falls within the range of 1 to 210, this indicates that the third bit must be **0**.

### Current Binary Representation:
- So far, we have determined that the binary representation is **110**.

Now, we have used 2 ones (from "11") and 0 ones (from "0" at position 3), leaving us with 6 ones to place in the remaining 10 positions (from position 4 to position 13).

Would you like me to proceed to determine the next bit (the fourth position) using the same method?
Teacher: You're off to a good start, but there's a small error with the counting for the case when the third bit is 1. Let’s review the situation together:

So far, we have a 13‑digit binary number where the first two digits are “11.” This means we’ve used 2 ones, and we still need to place 6 ones in the remaining 11 positions.

Now consider the third digit:

• If you set the third digit to 0, then you still need to place 6 ones in the remaining 10 positions (positions 4 to 13).  
  The number of ways to do that is C(10, 6).

• If you set the third digit to 1, then you’ll have 3 ones in your prefix (“111”), so you’ll need to place 5 ones in the remaining 10 positions.  
  The number of ways to do that is C(10, 5).

Could you please recalculate C(10, 5) correctly (and also confirm C(10, 6))? Then use these counts to decide whether the third bit should be 0 or 1 given our target index of 175. Remember to explain your reasoning.
Student: Thank you for your guidance! Let's recalculate the combinations correctly for the third bit.

### Current Situation:
We have the binary representation starting as "11", which means we have used 2 ones, and we need to place 6 more ones in the remaining 11 positions (from position 3 to position 13). Our target index for the remaining combinations is now 175.

### Step 1: Analyze the third position

1. **If we place a **0** in the third position**:
   - We have 10 remaining positions (from position 4 to position 13) to place the remaining 6 ones.
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(10, 6) = C(10, 4) = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 210
   \]

2. **If we place a **1** in the third position**:
   - We will have 3 ones in our prefix ("111"), so we need to place 5 ones in the remaining 10 positions (from position 4 to position 13).
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(10, 5) = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 252
   \]

### Step 2: Compare the counts

Now we compare the counts with our target index (175):
- If the third bit is **0**, we can form **210** valid combinations. This means that the numbers formed with the third bit as 0 will occupy positions 1 through 210.
- If the third bit is **1**, we can form **252** valid combinations, which will occupy positions 211 through 462.

Since \( 175 \) falls within the range of 1 to 210, this indicates that the third bit should be **0**.

### Current Binary Representation:
- So far, we have determined that the binary representation is **110**.

Now, we have used 2 ones (from "11") and 0 ones (from "0" at position 3), leaving us with 6 ones to place in the remaining 10 positions (from position 4 to position 13).

Would you like me to proceed to determine the next bit (the fourth position) using the same method?
Teacher: Great job recalculating the combination counts for the third bit! You correctly identified that with the prefix "11" and a 0 in the third position, there are 210 possibilities, and since 175 falls in that range, choosing 0 was correct. So our binary string so far is "110", with 2 ones already (from the “11”) and then a 0 (keeping the total ones at 2). We still must place 6 ones in the remaining 10 positions and our current target index remains at 175.

Now, let’s move to the fourth bit.

Step 3: For the fourth bit (i.e., position 4), use the following reasoning:
• With the current prefix "110", there are 10 positions remaining (positions 4 to 13) and we need to place 6 ones.
• If we set the fourth bit to 0, then we still need to place 6 ones in the remaining 9 positions. The number of valid completions will be C(9, 6).
• If we set the fourth bit to 1, then our prefix becomes "1101". That means we have used one more one (so in total 3 ones so far) and then we need to place the remaining 5 ones in the last 9 positions. The number of completions will be C(9, 5).

Could you please work out:
1. C(9, 6) and C(9, 5),
2. Compare those numbers with our current target index of 175, and
3. Decide whether the fourth bit should be 0 or 1, along with explaining your reasoning?

Remember, you only need to solve the fourth bit step right now. Feel free to show your work for these combination counts and the decision-making process.
Student: Sure! Let's analyze the fourth bit of our binary representation, which currently is "1100". We still need to place 6 ones in the remaining 10 positions (from position 4 to position 13).

### Step 1: Analyze the fourth position

1. **If we place a **0** in the fourth position**:
   - We need to place 6 ones in the remaining 9 positions (from position 5 to position 13).
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(9, 6) = C(9, 3) = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 84
   \]

2. **If we place a **1** in the fourth position**:
   - Our prefix becomes "1101", which means we have used 3 ones. Now we need to place 5 ones in the remaining 9 positions (from position 5 to position 13).
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(9, 5) = C(9, 4) = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 126
   \]

### Step 2: Compare the counts

Now, we need to compare the counts with our target index (175):
- If the fourth bit is **0**, we can form **84** valid combinations. This means that the numbers formed with the fourth bit as 0 will occupy positions 1 through 84.
- If the fourth bit is **1**, we can form **126** valid combinations, which will occupy positions 85 through 210.

Since \( 175 \) falls within the range of 85 to 210, this indicates that the fourth bit should be **1**.

### Current Binary Representation:
- So far, we have determined that the binary representation is **1101**.

Now, we have used 3 ones (from "1101") and still need to place 5 ones in the remaining 9 positions (from position 5 to position 13).

Would you like me to proceed to determine the next bit (the fifth position) using the same method?
Teacher: Excellent work on the fourth bit! Your calculations are correct:

• With the prefix "110" and placing a 0 in the fourth position, there would be C(9, 6) = 84 completions.  
• With the prefix "110" and placing a 1 in the fourth position, there would be C(9, 5) = 126 completions.  

Since 84 < 175 ≤ 84 + 126 (i.e. 175 lies between 85 and 210), you correctly deduced that the fourth bit must be 1. Thus, the binary number now starts with "1101".

Remember, by choosing a 1 here, we are effectively skipping over the first 84 possibilities (which would have come from putting a 0 at the fourth position). Therefore, the new target index for the remaining bits becomes 175 – 84 = 91.

Also, note that with the prefix "1101", we have used 3 ones so far. That means in the remaining 9 positions (positions 5 to 13) we need to place 5 ones.

Now, for the next step:

Step 4: Determine the fifth bit (i.e., position 5) using the same method.  
• With the current prefix "1101", if you put a 0 in the fifth position, you would have 9 – 1 = 8 positions remaining in which you still need to place 5 ones. The number of completions would be C(8, 5).  
• If instead you put a 1 in the fifth position, then you would have used one additional one (making 4 ones in total) and you need to place 4 ones in the remaining 8 positions. The number of completions would be C(8, 4).

Could you please calculate C(8, 5) and C(8, 4), then decide which bit (0 or 1) should be at the fifth position based on the new target index of 91? Explain your reasoning.
Student: Sure! Let's analyze the fifth bit of our binary representation, which currently is "1101". We need to place 5 ones in the remaining 9 positions (from position 5 to position 13). Our new target index for the remaining combinations is now 91.

### Step 1: Analyze the fifth position

1. **If we place a **0** in the fifth position**:
   - We will have 8 remaining positions (from position 6 to position 13) to place the remaining 5 ones.
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(8, 5) = C(8, 3) = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
   \]

2. **If we place a **1** in the fifth position**:
   - Our prefix becomes "11011", which means we have used 4 ones so far. Now we need to place 4 ones in the remaining 8 positions (from position 6 to position 13).
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(8, 4) = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 70
   \]

### Step 2: Compare the counts

Now, we need to compare the counts with our target index (91):
- If the fifth bit is **0**, we can form **56** valid combinations. This means that the numbers formed with the fifth bit as 0 will occupy positions 1 through 56.
- If the fifth bit is **1**, we can form **70** valid combinations, which will occupy positions 57 through 126.

Since \( 91 \) falls within the range of 57 to 126, this indicates that the fifth bit should be **1**.

### Current Binary Representation:
- So far, we have determined that the binary representation is **11011**.

Now, we have used 4 ones (from "11011") and still need to place 4 ones in the remaining 8 positions (from position 6 to position 13).

Would you like me to proceed to determine the next bit (the sixth position) using the same method?
Teacher: Great job! Your calculation for the fifth bit is correct. You found that:

• If the fifth bit is 0, then the number of completions is C(8, 5) = 56.  
• If the fifth bit is 1, then the number of completions is C(8, 4) = 70.

Since the target index is 91 and 91 falls in the second block (positions 57 through 126), you correctly deduced that the fifth bit must be 1, making the prefix "11011." That leaves us with 4 ones (since we now have four ones total) to place in the remaining 8 positions (positions 6 to 13). Also, because we used the 56 possibilities from the scenario where the fifth bit was 0, the new target index becomes 91 – 56 = 35.

Now, let's move to the next step:

Step 5: Determine the sixth bit (position 6) for the binary representation.  
• With the current prefix "11011", if we choose 0 for the sixth bit, then there are 8 - 1 = 7 positions left (positions 7 to 13) in which we need to place all 4 ones (since the ones remain unchanged). The number of completions is C(7, 4).  
• If we choose 1 for the sixth bit, then we would have one extra one in our prefix (making 5 ones present in "11011"1), so we would need to place the remaining 3 ones in the last 7 positions. The number of completions is C(7, 3).

Could you please calculate C(7, 4) and C(7, 3), compare them with our current target index of 35, and determine whether the sixth bit should be 0 or 1? Remember, show your work for these combination counts and your reasoning.
Student: Sure! Let's analyze the sixth bit of our binary representation, which currently is "11011". We need to place 4 ones in the remaining 8 positions (from position 6 to position 13). Our new target index for the remaining combinations is now 35.

### Step 1: Analyze the sixth position

1. **If we place a **0** in the sixth position**:
   - We will have 7 remaining positions (from position 7 to position 13) to place the remaining 4 ones.
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(7, 4) = C(7, 3) = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 35
   \]

2. **If we place a **1** in the sixth position**:
   - Our prefix becomes "110111", which means we have used 5 ones so far. Now we need to place the remaining 3 ones in the remaining 7 positions (from position 7 to position 13).
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(7, 3) = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 35
   \]

### Step 2: Compare the counts

Now, we need to compare the counts with our target index (35):
- If the sixth bit is **0**, we can form **35** valid combinations. This means that the numbers formed with the sixth bit as 0 will occupy positions 1 through 35.
- If the sixth bit is **1**, we can also form **35** valid combinations, which will occupy positions 36 through 70.

Since \( 35 \) falls exactly at the end of the range for the first case (positions 1 through 35), this indicates that the sixth bit should be **0**.

### Current Binary Representation:
- So far, we have determined that the binary representation is **110110**.

Now, we have used 4 ones (from "11011") and 0 ones (from "0" at position 6), leaving us with 4 ones to place in the remaining 7 positions (from position 7 to position 13).

Shall I proceed to determine the next bit (the seventh position) using the same method?
Teacher: Great work on determining the sixth bit! Your calculations showed that with the prefix "11011" and using the sixth bit we have two cases:

• If the sixth bit is 0, then the number of completions is C(7, 4) = 35.  
• If the sixth bit is 1, then the number of completions is C(7, 3) = 35.

Since our current target index is exactly 35 and that exactly fills the block for choosing 0 (positions 1–35), you correctly chose 0. Thus, our binary string now is "110110". We still need to place 4 ones in the remaining 7 positions (positions 7 to 13).

Now, let’s move on to the next step:

Step 6: Determine the seventh bit (position 7).  
• With the current prefix "110110", if we choose 0 for the seventh bit, then we would have 7 – 1 = 6 positions left and still need to place 4 ones. The number of valid completions will be C(6, 4).  
• If we choose 1 for the seventh bit, then our prefix would become "1101101", meaning we have used one more one (making a total of 5 ones) and we would then need to place 3 ones in the remaining 6 positions. The number of completions will be C(6, 3).

Could you please calculate C(6, 4) and C(6, 3), compare these numbers with our current target index of 35, and decide whether the seventh bit should be 0 or 1? Please explain your reasoning and show your work for this step.
Student: Sure! Let's analyze the seventh bit of our binary representation, which currently is "110110". We need to place 4 ones in the remaining 7 positions (from position 7 to position 13). Our current target index for the remaining combinations is still 35.

### Step 1: Analyze the seventh position

1. **If we place a **0** in the seventh position**:
   - We will have 6 remaining positions (from position 8 to position 13) to place the remaining 4 ones.
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(6, 4) = C(6, 2) = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
   \]

2. **If we place a **1** in the seventh position**:
   - Our prefix becomes "1101101", which means we have used 5 ones so far. Now we need to place the remaining 3 ones in the remaining 6 positions (from position 8 to position 13).
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(6, 3) = \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 20
   \]

### Step 2: Compare the counts

Now, we need to compare the counts with our target index (35):
- If the seventh bit is **0**, we can form **15** valid combinations. This means that the numbers formed with the seventh bit as 0 will occupy positions 1 through 15.
- If the seventh bit is **1**, we can form **20** valid combinations, which will occupy positions 16 through 35.

Since \( 35 \) falls exactly at the end of the range for the second case (positions 16 through 35), this indicates that the seventh bit should be **1**.

### Current Binary Representation:
- So far, we have determined that the binary representation is **1101101**.

Now, we have used 5 ones (from "1101101") and still need to place 3 ones in the remaining 6 positions (from position 8 to position 13).

Would you like me to proceed to determine the next bit (the eighth position) using the same method?
Teacher: Great work! Your reasoning for the seventh bit is detailed and well done. You correctly computed:

• C(6, 4) = 15 for placing 0 at the seventh bit (giving combinations for positions 8–13), and  
• C(6, 3) = 20 for placing 1 at the seventh bit.

Since our current target index is 35 and the block for a 0 at the seventh bit covers positions 1–15 while choosing a 1 covers positions 16–35, and 35 falls exactly at the end of the second block, your decision to choose 1 for the seventh bit is correct. That gives us the binary prefix "1101101."

Now we have 5 ones in the prefix and need to place 3 ones in the remaining 6 positions (positions 8 to 13).

Let’s move on to the next step:

Step 7: Determine the eighth bit (position 8).  
• With the current prefix "1101101", if you set the eighth bit to 0, then you'll have 6 – 1 = 5 positions remaining (positions 9 to 13) to place all 3 ones, and the number of valid completions will be C(5, 3).  
• If you set the eighth bit to 1, your prefix becomes "11011011", which means you'll have used one more one (totaling 6 ones) and then you'll have 5 positions remaining to place the remaining 2 ones. The number of completions will be C(5, 2).

Would you please calculate C(5, 3) and C(5, 2), compare these with our current target index of 35 (adjusted based on previous counts), and decide whether the eighth bit should be 0 or 1? Explain your reasoning for this step.
Student: Sure! Let's analyze the eighth bit of our binary representation, which currently is "1101101". We need to place 3 ones in the remaining 6 positions (from position 8 to position 13). Our current target index for the remaining combinations is still 35.

### Step 1: Analyze the eighth position

1. **If we place a **0** in the eighth position**:
   - We will have 5 remaining positions (from position 9 to position 13) to place the remaining 3 ones.
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(5, 3) = C(5, 2) = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
   \]

2. **If we place a **1** in the eighth position**:
   - Our prefix becomes "11011011", which means we have used 6 ones so far. Now we need to place the remaining 2 ones in the remaining 5 positions (from position 9 to position 13).
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(5, 2) = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
   \]

### Step 2: Compare the counts

Now, we need to compare the counts with our target index (35):
- If the eighth bit is **0**, we can form **10** valid combinations. This means that the numbers formed with the eighth bit as 0 will occupy positions 1 through 10.
- If the eighth bit is **1**, we can also form **10** valid combinations, which will occupy positions 11 through 20.

Since \( 35 \) is greater than 20, it indicates that both options do not cover the target index of 35. However, since we have exhausted all combinations for positions 1 through 20, we need to consider the next positions.

Since both counts are equal, we can choose either 0 or 1 at the eighth position. However, since we need to move forward, let's choose **0** for the eighth position to keep our options open for the remaining bits.

### Current Binary Representation:
- So far, we have determined that the binary representation is **11011010**.

Now, we have used 6 ones (from "11011010") and need to place 3 ones in the remaining 5 positions (from position 9 to position 13).

Would you like me to proceed to determine the next bit (the ninth position) using the same method?
Teacher: Let's take a moment to reexamine our progress and adjust the target index for the remaining positions before deciding on the eighth bit.

To recap quickly:
• Our 13‐digit number so far is "1101101".  
• That gives us 5 ones in the prefix, so we need to place 3 ones in the remaining 6 positions (positions 8 through 13).  
• Initially, after the previous steps, we had a target index of 35 for the block starting at position 6. When you worked on the seventh bit, you compared:  
 – If the seventh bit were 0, there would be C(6,4) = 15 completions, and  
 – If the seventh bit were 1, there would be C(6,3) = 20 completions.  
Since 35 fell in the second block (positions 16–35), you chose a 1 for the seventh bit. Now, because the block with a 0 at the seventh bit (15 possibilities) is skipped, the new target index for the remaining positions becomes 35 – 15 = 20. 

Now, for step 7 (determining the eighth bit):
• With the prefix "1101101", we now have 6 positions left (positions 8 to 13) in which we must place 3 ones. Thus, the total number of completions is C(6, 3) = 20—which matches our new target index.
• At the eighth bit, consider:
 ○ If we set the eighth bit to 0, then we have 5 positions left to place all 3 ones. The number of completions for that case is C(5, 3).  
 ○ If we set the eighth bit to 1, then we would have already placed another one (making the prefix have 6 ones), and then we would need to place 2 ones in the remaining 5 positions—that is C(5, 2).

Could you please:
1. Recalculate C(5, 3) and C(5, 2) explicitly,
2. Compare them with our adjusted target index of 20,
3. And then decide whether the eighth bit should be 0 or 1? 

Take your time to explain your work and reasoning for this step.
Student: Thank you for the clarification! Let's analyze the eighth bit of our binary representation, which currently is "1101101". We need to place 3 ones in the remaining 6 positions (from position 8 to position 13). Our adjusted target index for the remaining combinations is now 20.

### Step 1: Analyze the eighth position

1. **If we place a **0** in the eighth position**:
   - We will have 5 remaining positions (from position 9 to position 13) to place the remaining 3 ones.
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(5, 3) = C(5, 2) = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
   \]

2. **If we place a **1** in the eighth position**:
   - Our prefix becomes "11011011", which means we have used 6 ones so far. Now we need to place the remaining 2 ones in the remaining 5 positions (from position 9 to position 13).
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(5, 2) = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
   \]

### Step 2: Compare the counts

Now, we need to compare the counts with our target index (20):
- If the eighth bit is **0**, we can form **10** valid combinations. This means that the numbers formed with the eighth bit as 0 will occupy positions 1 through 10.
- If the eighth bit is **1**, we can also form **10** valid combinations, which will occupy positions 11 through 20.

Since \( 20 \) falls exactly at the end of the range for the second case (positions 11 through 20), this indicates that the eighth bit should be **1**.

### Current Binary Representation:
- So far, we have determined that the binary representation is **11011011**.

Now, we have used 6 ones (from "11011011") and need to place 2 ones in the remaining 5 positions (from position 9 to position 13).

Shall I proceed to determine the next bit (the ninth position) using the same method?
Teacher: Excellent work on recalculating and deciding that the eighth bit should be 1. Now our binary prefix is "11011011". With this prefix, we have used 6 ones so far, and we must place the remaining 2 ones in the final 5 positions (positions 9 through 13).

Let's move on to the next step:

Step 8: Determine the ninth bit (position 9).

• With the current prefix "11011011", if we choose 0 for the ninth bit, then we'll have 5 – 1 = 4 positions remaining where we must place exactly 2 ones. The number of completions for that case is C(4, 2).

• If we choose 1 for the ninth bit, then our prefix becomes "110110111", and we will have used one additional one (making 7 ones in total), leaving us needing to place 1 one in the remaining 4 positions. The number of completions for that is C(4, 1).

Could you please:
1. Calculate C(4, 2) and C(4, 1),
2. Compare those counts with our current target index (which is the new target coming from the block from the previous step; you'll need to update or check it based on the counts from the eighth bit), and then
3. Decide whether the ninth bit should be 0 or 1, explaining your reasoning?

Remember, focus on just determining the ninth bit for now. Let me know your work and reasoning!
Student: Sure! Let's analyze the ninth bit of our binary representation, which currently is "11011011". We need to place 2 ones in the remaining 5 positions (from position 9 to position 13). 

### Current Situation:
- Our prefix is "11011011", which means we have used 6 ones so far.
- We need to place 2 ones in the remaining 5 positions (positions 9 to 13).
- Our current target index for the remaining combinations is 20 (from the previous step).

### Step 1: Analyze the ninth position

1. **If we place a **0** in the ninth position**:
   - We will have 4 remaining positions (from position 10 to position 13) to place the remaining 2 ones.
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(4, 2) = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
   \]

2. **If we place a **1** in the ninth position**:
   - Our prefix becomes "110110111", which means we have used 7 ones so far. Now we need to place the remaining 1 one in the remaining 4 positions (from position 10 to position 13).
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(4, 1) = 4
   \]

### Step 2: Compare the counts

Now, we need to compare the counts with our target index (20):
- If the ninth bit is **0**, we can form **6** valid combinations. This means that the numbers formed with the ninth bit as 0 will occupy positions 1 through 6.
- If the ninth bit is **1**, we can form **4** valid combinations, which will occupy positions 7 through 10.

Since \( 20 \) is greater than \( 10 \), this indicates that we have exhausted all combinations with the ninth bit as 0 and 1, and therefore, the ninth bit must be **0**.

### Current Binary Representation:
- So far, we have determined that the binary representation is **110110110**.

Now, we have used 6 ones (from "110110110") and need to place 2 ones in the remaining 4 positions (from position 10 to position 13).

Shall I proceed to determine the next bit (the tenth position) using the same method?
Teacher: Let's review the situation carefully before deciding on the ninth bit.

Your current state after determining the eighth bit is as follows:

• The binary prefix is "1101101" (from the first 7 bits), with 5 ones already.  
• In step 8 you determined the eighth bit. With 6 positions remaining (positions 8–13) and 3 ones to place, the total ways were C(6,3) = 20.  
 – If the eighth bit is 0, then there are C(5,3) = 10 completions.  
 – If the eighth bit is 1, then there are C(5,2) = 10 completions.  
Since our target index was T = 20 (for the 6 positions), and 20 falls at the end of the second block (positions 11–20), you correctly chose the eighth bit to be 1.  

Thus, your new prefix becomes "11011011". Now, let’s update the state precisely:
 • The prefix "11011011" (8 bits) has 6 ones.  
 • There remain 13 – 8 = 5 positions (positions 9–13) in which you must place 8 – 6 = 2 ones.  
The total number of valid completions now is C(5,2) = 10.  
Since you chose the second block for the eighth bit, you subtract the full size of the first block from your previous target. That is, your previous target T was 20, and the first block (if the eighth bit were 0) contributed 10 possibilities. So the new target for the remaining bits becomes T = 20 – 10 = 10.

Now we move to step 8 (which is now determining the ninth bit) with this updated state:
 • Prefix: "11011011"  
 • Remaining positions: 5 positions (positions 9–13)  
 • Ones to place: 2  
 • Total possibilities for the remaining bits: C(5,2) = 10  
 • New target index: T = 10

For the ninth bit, consider these two cases:
1. If you choose 0 at the ninth bit, then:
 • You would have 4 positions left (positions 10–13) to place all 2 ones.  
 • The number of completions would be C(4,2).

2. If you choose 1 at the ninth bit, then:
 • Your prefix becomes "110110111", meaning you add another one (which would bring your count to 7 ones).  
 • You would then need to place 8 – 7 = 1 one in the remaining 4 positions.  
 • The number of completions would be C(4,1).

Could you please:
1. Calculate C(4,2) and C(4,1) explicitly,  
2. Determine the range of positions they cover (using your updated target index T = 10), and then  
3. Decide whether the ninth bit should be 0 or 1 based on these counts?  

Please explain your reasoning for this step.
Student: Sure! Let's analyze the ninth bit of our binary representation, which currently is "11011011". We need to place 2 ones in the remaining 5 positions (from position 9 to position 13). Our updated target index for the remaining combinations is now 10.

### Step 1: Analyze the ninth position

1. **If we place a **0** in the ninth position**:
   - We will have 4 remaining positions (from position 10 to position 13) to place the remaining 2 ones.
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(4, 2) = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
   \]

2. **If we place a **1** in the ninth position**:
   - Our prefix becomes "110110111", which means we have used 7 ones so far. Now we need to place the remaining 1 one in the remaining 4 positions (from position 10 to position 13).
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(4, 1) = 4
   \]

### Step 2: Compare the counts

Now, we need to compare the counts with our target index (10):
- If the ninth bit is **0**, we can form **6** valid combinations. This means that the numbers formed with the ninth bit as 0 will occupy positions 1 through 6.
- If the ninth bit is **1**, we can form **4** valid combinations, which will occupy positions 7 through 10.

Since \( 10 \) falls at the end of the range for the second case (positions 7 through 10), this indicates that the ninth bit should be **1**.

### Current Binary Representation:
- So far, we have determined that the binary representation is **110110111**.

Now, we have used 7 ones (from "110110111") and need to place 1 one in the remaining 4 positions (from position 10 to position 13).

Shall I proceed to determine the next bit (the tenth position) using the same method?
Teacher: Excellent work on determining the ninth bit! With your careful reasoning, we now have the prefix "110110111" (9 bits), and we’ve used 7 ones so far. This leaves us with 4 positions (positions 10–13) in which we must place exactly 1 remaining one. Also, recall that our updated target index for the remaining combinations was 10 before you decided on the ninth bit; after choosing a 1 for the ninth bit (which covers positions 7–10 within that block), the new target index becomes 10 – 6 = 4 (since if you had chosen 0 you would have accounted for 6 combinations, but here you chose the second block).

Now, let’s move on to the next step:

Step 9 (tenth bit):  
• Our current prefix is "110110111" and we have 4 positions left with exactly 1 one to place.  
• For the tenth bit, consider:  
 ○ If you choose 0, then you have 3 positions remaining (positions 11–13) to place that 1 one, which gives C(3, 1) completions.  
 ○ If you choose 1, then your prefix becomes "1101101111" (using the extra one), leaving you with 3 positions to place 0 ones (which is C(3, 0)).  

Could you please calculate C(3, 1) and C(3, 0), determine the ranges they occupy with respect to our current target index of 4, and decide whether the tenth bit should be 0 or 1? Just focus on the tenth bit step and share your reasoning for that decision.
Student: Sure! Let's analyze the tenth bit of our binary representation, which currently is "110110111". We need to place 1 one in the remaining 4 positions (from position 10 to position 13). Our updated target index for the remaining combinations is now 4.

### Step 1: Analyze the tenth position

1. **If we place a **0** in the tenth position**:
   - We will have 3 remaining positions (from position 11 to position 13) to place the remaining 1 one.
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(3, 1) = 3
   \]

2. **If we place a **1** in the tenth position**:
   - Our prefix becomes "1101101111", which means we have used all 8 ones now. We would have no ones left to place in the remaining 3 positions (from position 11 to position 13).
   - The number of ways to do this is given by:
   \[
   C(3, 0) = 1
   \]

### Step 2: Compare the counts

Now, we need to compare the counts with our target index (4):
- If the tenth bit is **0**, we can form **3** valid combinations. This means that the numbers formed with the tenth bit as 0 will occupy positions 1 through 3.
- If the tenth bit is **1**, we can form **1** valid combination, which will occupy position 4.

Since \( 4 \) falls exactly at the end of the range for the second case (positions 4), this indicates that the tenth bit should be **1**.

### Current Binary Representation:
- So far, we have determined that the binary representation is **1101101111**.

Now, we have used all 8 ones, and we are left with 2 positions (positions 11 to 13) where we don’t need to place any more ones. 

Shall I proceed to determine the next bit (the eleventh position) using the same method?
Teacher: Great work so far! Let's review our current status before moving on:

• So far, you have determined the first 10 bits of our 13‐digit binary number as  
  1101101111  
• This prefix uses all 8 ones (positions 1–10).  
• Therefore, in the remaining 3 positions (positions 11 to 13) we cannot add any more ones; they must all be 0.  

This means that the full binary representation of our 1000th number in S is:  
  1101101111 000

Now that we have the complete 13‐digit binary number:
  1101101111000

The next (and final) step is to find the remainder when this number is divided by 1000. What would be your plan for converting this binary number into decimal and then computing its remainder mod 1000? Please describe your plan (and any calculations you do) before proceeding to compute the final remainder.
Student: To find the remainder when the binary number \( 1101101111000 \) is divided by 1000, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert the Binary Number to Decimal**:
   The binary number \( 1101101111000 \) can be converted to decimal by evaluating each bit's contribution based on its position. The binary representation can be expanded as follows:
   \[
   1 \times 2^{12} + 1 \times 2^{11} + 0 \times 2^{10} + 1 \times 2^{9} + 1 \times 2^{8} + 0 \times 2^{7} + 1 \times 2^{6} + 1 \times 2^{5} + 1 \times 2^{4} + 0 \times 2^{3} + 0 \times 2^{2} + 0 \times 2^{1} + 0 \times 2^{0}
   \]

   Calculating each term:
   - \( 1 \times 2^{12} = 4096 \)
   - \( 1 \times 2^{11} = 2048 \)
   - \( 0 \times 2^{10} = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \times 2^{9} = 512 \)
   - \( 1 \times 2^{8} = 256 \)
   - \( 0 \times 2^{7} = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \times 2^{6} = 64 \)
   - \( 1 \times 2^{5} = 32 \)
   - \( 1 \times 2^{4} = 16 \)
   - \( 0 \times 2^{3} = 0 \)
   - \( 0 \times 2^{2} = 0 \)
   - \( 0 \times 2^{1} = 0 \)
   - \( 0 \times 2^{0} = 0 \)

   Now summing these values:
   \[
   4096 + 2048 + 0 + 512 + 256 + 0 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 6144
   \]

2. **Calculate the Remainder**:
   Now that we have the decimal equivalent of the binary number, which is \( 6144 \), we need to find the remainder when dividing \( 6144 \) by \( 1000 \):
   \[
   6144 \mod 1000
   \]

   Performing the division:
   \[
   6144 \div 1000 = 6 \quad \text{(quotient)}
   \]
   \[
   6 \times 1000 = 6000
   \]
   \[
   6144 - 6000 = 144
   \]

Thus, the remainder when \( 6144 \) is divided by \( 1000 \) is \( 144 \).

### Final Answer:
The remainder when \( N \) is divided by \( 1000 \) is \( \boxed{144} \).
Teacher: Your plan for converting the binary number to decimal and then finding the remainder mod 1000 is on the right track. However, take a moment to re‐examine your conversion step carefully. Notice that the binary number is

  1101101111000

and it has 13 digits. Label the positions from 12 down to 0 (with position 12 being the leftmost bit). Be sure to account for every bit correctly. For example, verify whether the bit at position 3 is 0 or 1. Once you have the correct contributions from each bit (2^(position) if that bit is 1, and 0 if it is 0), sum them up to get the decimal value and then compute the remainder when divided by 1000.

Could you please recalculate the decimal value of 1101101111000 carefully (making sure to correctly count all the bits), and then compute N mod 1000? Explain your work as you do it.
Student: Sure! Let's carefully convert the binary number \( 1101101111000 \) to decimal, making sure to correctly account for each bit's contribution based on its position.

### Step 1: Convert the Binary Number to Decimal

The binary number \( 1101101111000 \) can be expanded as follows:

\[
1 \times 2^{12} + 1 \times 2^{11} + 0 \times 2^{10} + 1 \times 2^{9} + 1 \times 2^{8} + 0 \times 2^{7} + 1 \times 2^{6} + 1 \times 2^{5} + 1 \times 2^{4} + 0 \times 2^{3} + 0 \times 2^{2} + 0 \times 2^{1} + 0 \times 2^{0}
\]

Calculating each term:

- \( 1 \times 2^{12} = 4096 \)
- \( 1 \times 2^{11} = 2048 \)
- \( 0 \times 2^{10} = 0 \)
- \( 1 \times 2^{9} = 512 \)
- \( 1 \times 2^{8} = 256 \)
- \( 0 \times 2^{7} = 0 \)
- \( 1 \times 2^{6} = 64 \)
- \( 1 \times 2^{5} = 32 \)
- \( 1 \times 2^{4} = 16 \)
- \( 0 \times 2^{3} = 0 \)
- \( 0 \times 2^{2} = 0 \)
- \( 0 \times 2^{1} = 0 \)
- \( 0 \times 2^{0} = 0 \)

Now summing these values:

\[
4096 + 2048 + 0 + 512 + 256 + 0 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 6144
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Remainder

Now that we have the decimal equivalent of the binary number, which is \( 6144 \), we need to find the remainder when dividing \( 6144 \) by \( 1000 \):

\[
6144 \mod 1000
\]

Performing the division:

\[
6144 \div 1000 = 6 \quad \text{(quotient)}
\]

Calculating the product:

\[
6 \times 1000 = 6000
\]

Finding the remainder:

\[
6144 - 6000 = 144
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the remainder when \( N \) is divided by \( 1000 \) is \( \boxed{144} \).
Teacher: You've made a good effort converting the binary number to decimal. However, it looks like there is a small misstep in accounting for each bit's value. Let's reexamine the binary number carefully:

Our complete 13‐digit binary number is  
  1101101111000  
Label the positions from 12 down to 0 (with position 12 being the leftmost bit). Write down the digits with their positions:

  Position: 12  11  10  9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0  
  Digit:   1   1   0  1   1  0  1  1  1  1  0  0  0

Now, the contribution of each 1 is 2^(position):

• Position 12: 1 → 2¹² = 4096  
• Position 11: 1 → 2¹¹ = 2048  
• Position 10: 0 → 0  
• Position 9:  1 → 2⁹ = 512  
• Position 8:  1 → 2⁸ = 256  
• Position 7:  0 → 0  
• Position 6:  1 → 2⁶ = 64  
• Position 5:  1 → 2⁵ = 32  
• Position 4:  1 → 2⁴ = 16  
• Position 3:  1 → 2³ = 8  
• Positions 2, 1, 0 are 0’s.

Now, summing these contributions gives:  
  4096 + 2048 = 6144  
  6144 + 512 = 6656  
  6656 + 256 = 6912  
  6912 + 64 = 6976  
  6976 + 32 = 7008  
  7008 + 16 = 7024  
  7024 + 8 = 7032

Thus, the decimal equivalent of 1101101111000 is 7032.

Now to find the remainder when 7032 is divided by 1000:
  7032 ÷ 1000 gives a quotient of 7 (since 7×1000 = 7000) and a remainder of:
