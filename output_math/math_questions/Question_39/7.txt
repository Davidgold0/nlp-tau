Question: Let $S$ be the increasing sequence of positive integers whose binary representation has exactly $8$ ones. Let $N$ be the 1000th number in $S$. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.
3o-mini: We wish to list in increasing order all positive integers whose binary representation has exactly 8 ones. Let S be this sequence, and let N be the 1000th element of S. We are asked to compute N mod 1000.

Step 1. Count How Many Numbers Have Exactly 8 Ones by Bit‐Length

Any positive integer is represented in binary with a “leading 1”. Thus if an integer has n bits (with n ≥ 8, since to have 8 ones the number must have at least 8 digits) then its most‐significant bit is fixed to 1 and we must choose exactly 7 more 1’s from the remaining n – 1 positions. Hence, the number of n–bit numbers with exactly 8 ones is

  C(n – 1, 7).

Now, count them by n:

• For n = 8: C(7, 7) = 1.
• For n = 9: C(8, 7) = 8.
• For n = 10: C(9, 7) = 36.
• For n = 11: C(10, 7) = 120.
• For n = 12: C(11, 7) = 330.
• For n = 13: C(12, 7) = 792.

Compute the cumulative counts:
  n = 8: 1
  n = 9: 1 + 8 = 9
  n = 10: 9 + 36 = 45
  n = 11: 45 + 120 = 165
  n = 12: 165 + 330 = 495
  n = 13: 495 + 792 = 1287

Since the cumulative number reaches 495 by n = 12 and 1287 by n = 13, the 1000th number lies among the 13–bit numbers. In fact, it is the (1000 – 495) = 505th smallest 13–bit number with exactly 8 ones.

Step 2. Find the 505th 13–Bit Number with Exactly 8 Ones

A 13–bit number has bit positions 12 down to 0 (with bit 12 as the most significant). The most significant bit is fixed to 1. Then we need to fill positions 11 through 0 with exactly 7 ones. To “build” the number in increasing order it is most convenient to decide the digits from the next most significant (bit 11) to the least (bit 0); note that in numbers of fixed bit–length, the numerical order agrees with the lexicographic order of the bits.

Let k denote the count (starting with k = 505) among the 13–bit numbers. At each step we decide if a bit should be 0 or 1 by comparing how many numbers would result if we set that bit to 0.

Define:
 • remaining positions: the positions yet to be decided,
 • r: the number of 1’s still needed,
 • k: the index in the ordering among numbers with the prefix chosen so far.

Initially, for the 13–bit numbers:
 • The most significant bit (bit 12) is 1.
 • Remaining positions: 12 (bits 11 down to 0).
 • r = 7 (we need 7 additional ones).

Now, decide each bit from bit 11 downwards:

1. Bit 11:
 • Option: Set bit 11 = 0.
  Number of completions = C(11, 7) = 330.
 • Since 330 < k = 505, the kth number is not among those with bit 11 = 0.
  Thus, set bit 11 = 1.
  Update: subtract 330, so new k = 505 – 330 = 175.
  Also, one “1” is used, so r becomes 6.
  Remaining positions: 11 (bits 10 down to 0).

2. Bit 10:
 • Option: Set bit 10 = 0.
  Number of completions = C(10, 6) = 210.
 • Since 175 ≤ 210, we choose bit 10 = 0.
  No subtraction from k; k remains 175.
  r stays at 6.
  Remaining positions: 10 (bits 9 down to 0).

3. Bit 9:
 • Option: Set bit 9 = 0.
  Number of completions = C(9, 6) = C(9, 3) = 84.
 • Since 84 < k = 175, we skip these.
  Thus, set bit 9 = 1.
  Update: k = 175 – 84 = 91.
  r becomes 5 (since we used one more 1).
  Remaining positions: 9 (bits 8 down to 0).

4. Bit 8:
 • Option: Set bit 8 = 0.
  Number of completions = C(8, 5) = C(8, 3) = 56.
 • Since 56 < k = 91, choose bit 8 = 1.
  Update: k = 91 – 56 = 35.
  r becomes 4.
  Remaining positions: 8 (bits 7 down to 0).

5. Bit 7:
 • Option: Set bit 7 = 0.
  Number of completions = C(7, 4) = 35.
 • Since 35 = k (k ≤ 35), we choose bit 7 = 0.
  Update: k remains 35.
  r remains 4.
  Remaining positions: 7 (bits 6 down to 0).

6. Bit 6:
 • Option: Set bit 6 = 0.
  Number of completions = C(6, 4) = 15.
 • Since 15 < k = 35, choose bit 6 = 1.
  Update: k = 35 – 15 = 20.
  r becomes 3.
  Remaining positions: 6 (bits 5 down to 0).

7. Bit 5:
 • Option: Set bit 5 = 0.
  Number of completions = C(5, 3) = 10.
 • Since 10 < k = 20, choose bit 5 = 1.
  Update: k = 20 – 10 = 10.
  r becomes 2.
  Remaining positions: 5 (bits 4 down to 0).

8. Bit 4:
 • Option: Set bit 4 = 0.
  Number of completions = C(4, 2) = 6.
 • Since 6 < k = 10, choose bit 4 = 1.
  Update: k = 10 – 6 = 4.
  r becomes 1.
  Remaining positions: 4 (bits 3 down to 0).

9. Bit 3:
 • Option: Set bit 3 = 0.
  Number of completions = C(3, 1) = 3.
 • Since 3 < k = 4, choose bit 3 = 1.
  Update: k = 4 – 3 = 1.
  r becomes 0.
  Remaining positions: 3 (bits 2 down to 0).

10. Bits 2, 1, 0:
 Since r = 0, the remaining bits must all be 0.

Step 3. Write Out the Binary Representation

Recall that the full 13–bit number has bits numbered 12 down to 0. We have determined:

• Bit 12: 1   (always)
• Bit 11: 1
• Bit 10: 0
• Bit 9: 1
• Bit 8: 1
• Bit 7: 0
• Bit 6: 1
• Bit 5: 1
• Bit 4: 1
• Bit 3: 1
• Bit 2: 0
• Bit 1: 0
• Bit 0: 0

So the binary number is: 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0

Step 4. Compute Its Decimal Value

Assign powers of 2 to each bit (bit positions 12 to 0):

• Bit 12: 2^12 = 4096
• Bit 11: 2^11 = 2048
• Bit 10: 0
• Bit 9: 2^9 = 512
• Bit 8: 2^8 = 256
• Bit 7: 0
• Bit 6: 2^6 = 64
• Bit 5: 2^5 = 32
• Bit 4: 2^4 = 16
• Bit 3: 2^3 = 8
• Bits 2, 1, 0: all 0

Now sum these values:
 4096 + 2048 = 6144
 6144 + 512 = 6656
 6656 + 256 = 6912
 6912 + 64 = 6976
 6976 + 32 = 7008
 7008 + 16 = 7024
 7024 + 8 = 7032

Thus, N = 7032.

Step 5. Find the Remainder When Dividing by 1000

Calculate 7032 mod 1000. Since 7032 – 7000 = 32, the remainder is 32.

Final Answer: 32.
