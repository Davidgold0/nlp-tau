Question: If $n$ is the smallest positive integer for which there exist positive real numbers $a$ and $b$ such that_x000D_
\[(a + bi)^n = (a - bi)^n,\]compute $\frac{b}{a}.$
3o-mini: We begin with the equation

  (a + bi)ⁿ = (a – bi)ⁿ.

Since a and b are positive real numbers, write a + bi in polar form:

  a + bi = r (cos θ + i sin θ)  with r = √(a² + b²) and θ = arctan(b/a).

Then its conjugate is

  a – bi = r (cos θ – i sin θ).

Raising both to the power n gives

  (a + bi)ⁿ = rⁿ (cos (nθ) + i sin (nθ)),
  (a – bi)ⁿ = rⁿ (cos (nθ) – i sin (nθ)).

For these two expressions to be equal, we require that the imaginary parts cancel, meaning

  cos(nθ) + i sin(nθ) = cos(nθ) – i sin(nθ).

This equality holds if and only if

  i sin(nθ) = -i sin(nθ)  ⟹  2i sin(nθ) = 0  ⟹  sin(nθ) = 0.

Thus, nθ must be an integer multiple of π:

  nθ = πk  for some integer k.

Since a and b are positive, the angle θ must lie in the interval (0, π/2). To satisfy nθ ∈ (0, n(π/2)), we look for the smallest positive integer n that yields a valid angle:

1. For n = 1, we have θ = πk. The only possibility is k = 0 or 1, but θ = 0 produces b = 0 and θ = π gives an angle outside (0, π/2). Hence, n = 1 is not valid.

2. For n = 2, choose k = 1 to get θ = π/2. However, θ = π/2 would imply that a = 0 (since arctan(b/a) = π/2 only when a = 0), which contradicts a > 0.

3. For n = 3, choose k = 1 to obtain
  3θ = π  ⟹  θ = π/3.
This θ lies within (0, π/2) and is acceptable.

Now, since tan θ = b/a, we have

  b/a = tan(π/3) = √3.

Thus, the desired result is √3.
