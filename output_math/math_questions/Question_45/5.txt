Question: If $n$ is the smallest positive integer for which there exist positive real numbers $a$ and $b$ such that_x000D_
\[(a + bi)^n = (a - bi)^n,\]compute $\frac{b}{a}.$
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem in our own words. We are given that a and b are positive real numbers and the equation

  (a + bi)ⁿ = (a − bi)ⁿ

holds for some positive integer n (with n as small as possible). Notice that a + bi and a − bi are complex conjugates. A common strategy is to express these complex numbers in polar form and consider what happens when you raise them to the nth power.

Here’s an outline of steps we might follow:

1. Express the complex number a + bi in polar form. That means writing it as r·[cos(θ) + i·sin(θ)], where r = √(a² + b²) and θ = arctan(b/a).
2. Recognize that the conjugate a − bi in polar form is r·[cos(θ) − i·sin(θ)] or, equivalently, r·[cos(−θ) + i·sin(−θ)].
3. Raise both expressions to the nth power. Use De Moivre’s Theorem so that (a + bi)ⁿ becomes rⁿ·[cos(nθ) + i·sin(nθ)] and (a − bi)ⁿ becomes rⁿ·[cos(nθ) − i·sin(nθ)].
4. Set these two equal to each other. Since the moduli (rⁿ) are the same, the equality forces the angles to satisfy a relationship.
5. Deduce what condition must be true for cos(nθ) + i·sin(nθ) to equal cos(nθ) − i·sin(nθ). (Hint: Think about what must happen to the sine term.)
6. Use the fact that a and b are positive (and hence θ is in the interval (0, π/2)) to find the smallest possible integer n that makes the equation hold.
7. Finally, relate θ to a and b (since tan(θ) = b/a) and use the value of θ found to compute b/a.

Let’s begin with the first step.

Step 1: Write the polar representation for a + bi, expressing it in the form r·[cos(θ) + i·sin(θ)], where r = √(a² + b²) and θ = arctan(b/a).

Please show me your work for this first step. What do you get for the polar form of a + bi and its corresponding conjugate?
Student: Sure! Let's start with the polar representation of the complex number \( a + bi \).

1. **Calculate the modulus \( r \)**:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
   \]

2. **Calculate the argument \( \theta \)**:
   \[
   \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)
   \]

Now we can express \( a + bi \) in polar form:
\[
a + bi = r \left( \cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta) \right) = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \left( \cos\left(\arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\right) + i \sin\left(\arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\right) \right)
\]

Next, for the conjugate \( a - bi \):
\[
a - bi = r \left( \cos(\theta) - i \sin(\theta) \right) = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \left( \cos\left(\arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\right) - i \sin\left(\arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\right) \right)
\]

So we have:
- \( a + bi = r \left( \cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta) \right) \)
- \( a - bi = r \left( \cos(\theta) - i \sin(\theta) \right) \)

Now, I've expressed both complex numbers in polar form. Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify or do next?
Teacher: Your work is correct! You've successfully expressed a + bi (and its conjugate) in polar form as follows:

  a + bi = √(a² + b²)·[cos(arctan(b/a)) + i·sin(arctan(b/a))]
  a − bi = √(a² + b²)·[cos(arctan(b/a)) − i·sin(arctan(b/a))]

Now, let’s move to the next step of the process.

Step 2: Use De Moivre’s Theorem to raise these expressions to the nth power. That is, express (a + bi)ⁿ and (a − bi)ⁿ accordingly.

Please show your work for this step (just the next step). What are your expressions for (a + bi)ⁿ and (a − bi)ⁿ using De Moivre's Theorem?
Student: Sure! Let's apply De Moivre’s Theorem to raise both expressions to the nth power.

According to De Moivre's Theorem, if we have a complex number in polar form \( r(\cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)) \), then raising it to the nth power gives us:

\[
(r(\cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta}))^n = r^n (\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta))
\]

Now, applying this to our expressions:

1. For \( (a + bi)^n \):
   \[
   (a + bi)^n = \left( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \right)^n \left( \cos(n \cdot \arctan(b/a)) + i \sin(n \cdot \arctan(b/a)) \right)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   (a + bi)^n = (a^2 + b^2)^{n/2} \left( \cos(n \cdot \arctan(b/a)) + i \sin(n \cdot \arctan(b/a)) \right)
   \]

2. For \( (a - bi)^n \):
   \[
   (a - bi)^n = \left( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \right)^n \left( \cos(n \cdot \arctan(b/a)) - i \sin(n \cdot \arctan(b/a)) \right)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   (a - bi)^n = (a^2 + b^2)^{n/2} \left( \cos(n \cdot \arctan(b/a)) - i \sin(n \cdot \arctan(b/a)) \right)
   \]

Now we have both \( (a + bi)^n \) and \( (a - bi)^n \) expressed in terms of \( r \) and \( \theta \). 

Would you like me to proceed to the next step?
Teacher: Great work on applying De Moivre's Theorem! Now, let's move to the next step.

Step 3: We know that (a + bi)ⁿ and (a − bi)ⁿ are equal, and since they both contain the same modulus (a² + b²)^(n/2), the equality must come from their angular parts. In other words, you have:

  cos(nθ) + i·sin(nθ) = cos(nθ) − i·sin(nθ)

What does this tell you about the sine term? In particular, what must be true about sin(nθ) for the two expressions to be identical? Please solve just this step by showing the necessary condition that arises from equating the expressions.
Student: To analyze the equality of \( (a + bi)^n \) and \( (a - bi)^n \), we have:

\[
\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta) = \cos(n\theta) - i\sin(n\theta)
\]

For these two expressions to be equal, both the real parts and the imaginary parts must be equal. The real parts are already equal since they both contain \( \cos(n\theta) \). Therefore, we need to focus on the imaginary parts:

\[
i\sin(n\theta) = -i\sin(n\theta)
\]

This implies that:

\[
\sin(n\theta) = -\sin(n\theta)
\]

For this equation to hold true, it must be that:

\[
\sin(n\theta) = 0
\]

The sine function equals zero at integer multiples of \( \pi \), which leads us to the condition:

\[
n\theta = k\pi \quad \text{for some integer } k
\]

Since \( \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \), we can rewrite this as:

\[
n \cdot \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = k\pi
\]

Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that this condition holds. 

Would you like to proceed with finding the smallest \( n \) and relating \( \theta \) to \( \frac{b}{a} \)?
Teacher: Great job on finding that sin(nθ) = 0, which led us to the condition

  nθ = kπ   (where k is some integer).

Since θ = arctan(b/a) and a, b > 0, we know that θ is in the interval (0, π/2). Now, for the equality to hold—you need to choose an integer k such that when you solve for θ, it remains in (0, π/2).

To proceed:

1. Use the equation nθ = kπ. What restrictions does θ ∈ (0, π/2) impose on k for a given n?  
2. Identify the smallest positive integer n for which there exist positive real numbers a and b. (Hint: Try starting with k = 1. Does that lead to a suitable value of n?)  
3. Once you have n and hence θ = π/n, remember that since tan(θ) = b/a, you'll have b/a = tan(π/n).  

Now, please work through this step:  
(a) Determine the appropriate value of k (likely k = 1) and then find the smallest possible integer n along with the corresponding θ, ensuring that θ is in (0, π/2).  
(b) Finally, use that to express b/a as tan(π/n).

Please show your work and reasoning for this step.
Student: Sure! Let's work through the steps you've outlined.

1. **Determining the value of k**: We start with the equation \( n\theta = k\pi \). Given that \( \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \) and \( \theta \) must be in the interval \( (0, \pi/2) \), we want to choose \( k \) such that \( \frac{k\pi}{n} \) remains in this interval. 

   Since \( \theta > 0 \), we need \( k > 0 \). Let's start with \( k = 1 \):
   \[
   n\theta = \pi \implies \theta = \frac{\pi}{n}
   \]

2. **Finding the smallest positive integer n**: Now we have:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{\pi}{n}
   \]
   We also know that \( \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \). Therefore, we can set:
   \[
   \frac{\pi}{n} = \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)
   \]

   Now, we need to find \( n \) such that \( \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \) is in \( (0, \pi/2) \). Since \( b/a \) is positive (as both \( a \) and \( b \) are positive), \( \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \) is indeed in \( (0, \pi/2) \) for any positive \( a \) and \( b \).

   If we take \( k = 1 \), we have \( n = 1 \) as the smallest integer that satisfies this equation, which gives:
   \[
   \theta = \pi
   \]
   However, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{n} \) needs to be in \( (0, \pi/2) \), so we should try \( k = 2 \):
   \[
   n\theta = 2\pi \implies \theta = \frac{2\pi}{n}
   \]
   If \( n = 2 \), then:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{2\pi}{2} = \pi
   \]
   This is still not in \( (0, \pi/2) \). 

   Let's try \( k = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \):
   \[
   n\theta = \pi \implies \theta = \frac{\pi}{2}
   \]
   This is still not valid.

   The next option is to try \( k = 1 \) with \( n = 3 \):
   \[
   n\theta = \pi \implies \theta = \frac{\pi}{3}
   \]

   Now, \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is in \( (0, \pi/2) \). So, we can take \( n = 3 \).

3. **Expressing \( \frac{b}{a} \)**: Now we have:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{\pi}{3} \implies \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \sqrt{3}
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{b}{a} = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \sqrt{3}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\frac{b}{a} = \sqrt{3}
\]

Is there anything else you would like me to clarify or further explain?
Teacher: Great work working through those steps! Let’s review what we did:

• We used the condition nθ = kπ and, noticing that θ = arctan(b/a) must be in (0, π/2), we set k = 1 to obtain θ = π/n.
• Since π/n must be between 0 and π/2, the smallest integer n that works is n = 3 (since if n = 2 then π/2 is at the boundary, not strictly within (0, π/2)).
• With n = 3, we have θ = π/3 which leads to b/a = tan(π/3) = √3.

Your reasoning is on track and your work is correct.

Your final answer is:
√3$
