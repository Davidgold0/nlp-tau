Question: If $n$ is the smallest positive integer for which there exist positive real numbers $a$ and $b$ such that_x000D_
\[(a + bi)^n = (a - bi)^n,\]compute $\frac{b}{a}.$
3o-mini: Let z = a + bi, where a and b are positive real numbers, and write z in polar form:
  z = r·e^(iθ), with r = √(a² + b²) and θ = arctan(b/a).

Then its conjugate is
  a - bi = r·e^(–iθ).

Raising z and its conjugate to the power n gives:
  (a + bi)ⁿ = rⁿ·e^(i nθ),
  (a – bi)ⁿ = rⁿ·e^(–i nθ).

The given equation is
  rⁿ·e^(i nθ) = rⁿ·e^(–i nθ).

Since rⁿ is positive, we can cancel it:
  e^(i nθ) = e^(–i nθ).

Multiply both sides by e^(i nθ) to obtain:
  e^(2i nθ) = 1.

Thus, 2nθ must be an integer multiple of 2π:
  2nθ = 2πk  for some integer k,
or equivalently,
  nθ = πk.

Since a and b are positive, the angle θ satisfies
  0 < θ < π/2.

To have a nonzero angle, k must be a positive integer. We need to find the smallest positive n for which there exists an integer k such that:
  θ = (πk)/n
lies in (0, π/2).

Test n = 1:
  θ = πk. For k = 1, θ = π, which is not in (0, π/2).
Test n = 2:
  For k = 1, θ = π/2, but then cos(θ) = 0, which would force a = 0. That violates a > 0.
Test n = 3:
  For k = 1, θ = π/3, and π/3 is in (0, π/2). This works.

Thus, the smallest positive integer n for which such a pair (a, b) exists is n = 3, and we have:
  θ = π/3.

Since tan(θ) = b/a, we compute:
  b/a = tan(π/3) = √3.

Therefore, the answer is √3.
