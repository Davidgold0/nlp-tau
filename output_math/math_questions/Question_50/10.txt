Question: If $F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c \times d$, what is the value of $x$ such that $F(2, x, 4, 11) = 300$?
3o-mini: The function F(a, b, c, d) is defined as F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + (c × d). We are given F(2, x, 4, 11) = 300, so substitute the values into the function:

  2^x + (4 × 11) = 300

Calculate 4 × 11:

  2^x + 44 = 300

Subtract 44 from both sides:

  2^x = 300 − 44
  2^x = 256

Since 256 is 2 raised to the 8th power (2^8):

  2^x = 2^8

Thus, x must be 8.
