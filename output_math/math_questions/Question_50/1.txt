Question: If $F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c \times d$, what is the value of $x$ such that $F(2, x, 4, 11) = 300$?
Teacher: Let's break down the problem into manageable steps.

Restating the question in our own words: We have the function F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c × d, and we need to find the value of x such that when a = 2, b = x, c = 4, and d = 11, the function equals 300. In other words, we're solving:

  2^x + 4 × 11 = 300.

Here's how we can approach this problem step by step:
1. Substitute the values into the function.
2. Compute the multiplication 4 × 11.
3. Set up the equation and isolate the term containing x.
4. Solve the resulting equation involving the exponent 2^x.

Let’s start with the first part:
What is the value of 4 × 11? Please calculate that and explain your step.
Student: To calculate \( 4 \times 11 \), we simply multiply the two numbers together:

\[
4 \times 11 = 44.
\]

So, the value of \( 4 \times 11 \) is 44. 

Now we can substitute this back into our equation. We have:

\[
2^x + 44 = 300.
\]

Shall we move on to the next step?
Teacher: Great work calculating 4 × 11! Now, let's move on to the next step.

We have the equation:  
2^x + 44 = 300.

To isolate the term with the exponent x, we need to eliminate the 44 from the left side. Can you show how to do that by subtracting 44 from both sides and then compute what 2^x equals? Please explain your steps.
Student: Student: Sure! To isolate the term with the exponent \( x \), we need to subtract 44 from both sides of the equation:

\[
2^x + 44 - 44 = 300 - 44.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2^x = 256.
\]

Now we have the equation \( 2^x = 256 \). 

Next, we can express 256 as a power of 2. Since \( 256 = 2^8 \), we can set the exponents equal to each other:

\[
x = 8.
\]

Shall I summarize this solution or do you want me to elaborate on any part?
Teacher: Excellent work! You correctly isolated the term to get 2^x = 256 and identified that 256 can be written as 2^8. This shows that x must be 8. 

Your reasoning is solid. The next step is to state the final answer. Please provide your final answer following the guidelines.
Student: The final answer to the question is:

\[
x = 8.
\]

This means that when we substitute \( x = 8 \) into the function \( F(2, x, 4, 11) \), it satisfies the equation \( F(2, 8, 4, 11) = 300 \). Thank you for guiding me through the steps!
Teacher: Great job working through each step! You've correctly determined that x = 8. Now, please state the final answer exactly as required, followed immediately by a $, with nothing else after the $.
