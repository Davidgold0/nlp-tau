3o-mini: We are given a right triangle (with one right angle) in which one of the acute angles (say at vertex A) satisfies

  tan(α/2) = 1/∛2             (1)

From vertex A we draw both the median AD (to the midpoint of the opposite side BC) and the internal angle bisector AE. We wish to find tan θ, where θ is the (smaller) angle between these two segments (i.e. the angle between AD and AE at A).

One approach is to introduce coordinates so that the computations become tractable.

Step 1. Setting up the triangle

We label our triangle as △ABC and choose vertex A to be the vertex where the acute angle α (with tan(α/2)= 1/∛2) is located. (The fact that the triangle is right‐angled will be used to get some nice relations among the side lengths; we choose the right angle to be at vertex B.)

Place:
  A = (0, 0),
  B = (1, 0).

Since B is the right angle, the segments AB and BC are perpendicular. Taking BC to be vertical, we can let
  C = (1, k)                (with k > 0).

Then side lengths become:
  AB = distance A to B = 1,
  AC = √[ (1–0)² + (k–0)² ] = √(1 + k²).

Next, determine angle A. At A the sides are along the vectors
  AB = (1, 0) and AC = (1, k),
so
  tan α = (k)/(1) = k.
Thus, α = arctan k.

Step 2. Relate k and the given tan(α/2)

We use a useful formula for the half–angle tangent:
  tan(α/2) = k/(√(1+k²)+1). 
(One way to see this is to note that from the vectors (1,0) and (1,k) the cosine and sine of α satisfy cosα = 1/√(1+k²) and sinα = k/√(1+k²), so that tan(α/2) = sinα/(1+cosα).)

We are given tan(α/2)= 1/∛2. Hence,
  k/(√(1+k²)+1) = 1/∛2.          (2)

It is convenient to let
  r = √(1+k²).
Then (2) becomes
  k/(r+1) = 1/∛2.            (3)

We will use (3) later.

Step 3. Locate the points D and E

• D is the midpoint of BC. With
  B = (1, 0) and C = (1, k),
we have
  D = (1, k/2).

• E is the point where the internal angle bisector from A meets side BC. By the Angle Bisector Theorem, the ratio in which E divides BC is the same as the ratio of the adjacent side lengths from A:
  BE : EC = AB : AC = 1 : r.
Since B = (1, 0) and C = (1, k), the point E must have the form
  E = (1, y),
and the distance from B to E is
  BE = y = k/(1+r).
Thus,
  E = (1, k/(1+r)).        (4)

Step 4. Compute the angle between AD and AE

The rays from A have endpoints:
  D = (1, k/2) and E = (1, k/(1+r)).
Thus, their vectors are:
  AD = (1, k/2)  and AE = (1, k/(1+r)).

The angle θ between AD and AE (with vertex A) can be computed from the difference of their direction angles. A useful formula is that if the vectors have slopes m₁ and m₂, then
  tan θ = |(m₁ – m₂)/(1 + m₁ m₂)|.

Here, the slopes (i.e. the tangent of the angles that the vectors make with the positive x–axis) are
  m_AD = (k/2)/1 = k/2  and  m_AE = (k/(1+r))/1 = k/(1+r).

Thus,
  tan θ = |(k/2 – k/(1+r))| / [1 + (k/2)(k/(1+r))].

Simplify the numerator:
  k/2 – k/(1+r) = k[(1+r) – 2] / [2(1+r)] = k(r – 1) / [2(1+r)].

Simplify the denominator:
  1 + (k²)/(2(1+r)).

Thus,
  tan θ = { k(r – 1) / [2(1+r)] } / { 1 + [k²/(2(1+r))] }.

Write the denominator as a single fraction:
  1 + k²/(2(1+r)) = [2(1+r) + k²] / [2(1+r)].

Then
  tan θ = [k(r – 1)] / [2(1+r)] × [2(1+r) / (2(1+r) + k²)] = k(r – 1) / [2(1+r) + k²].    (5)

But observe that
  r² = 1 + k² ⟹ k² = r² – 1.
So the denominator in (5) becomes:
  2(1+r) + (r² – 1) = 2 + 2r + r² – 1 = r² + 2r + 1 = (r+1)².

Thus (5) becomes:
  tan θ = [k(r – 1)] / (r+1)².        (6)

Now use equation (3): k/(r+1) = 1/∛2. That is, k = (r+1)/∛2.

Substitute this into (6):
  tan θ = [((r+1)/∛2) (r – 1)] / (r+1)² = (r – 1) / [∛2 (r+1)].

Step 5. Express (r – 1)/(r+1) in terms of 2^(1/3)

We can find (r – 1)/(r+1) by returning to (3). Square (3) to eliminate the square root:
  (k/(r+1))² = 1/2^(2/3).
But k² = r² – 1, so:
  (r² – 1)/(r+1)² = 1/2^(2/3).

Notice that r² – 1 factors as (r – 1)(r + 1). Thus,
  (r – 1)(r+1)/(r+1)² = (r – 1)/(r+1) = 1/2^(2/3).    (7)

Returning to (6), we now have:
  tan θ = (1/∛2)*(r – 1)/(r+1) = (1/∛2)·(1/2^(2/3)) = 1/2^(1/3+2/3) = 1/2.

Thus, the answer is:
  tan θ = 1/2.

Final Answer:
  tan θ = 1/2.
