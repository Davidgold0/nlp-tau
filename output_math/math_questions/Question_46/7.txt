3o-mini: We will show that, under the given conditions, one may prove that

  m∠PQC = 35°.

Below is one way to “discover” this answer; note that many different approaches exist.

Let us begin with a convex triangle ABC having m∠A = 70°. (The figure “is not drawn to scale” so that the various points (P and Q) lie in unexpected positions.) In addition the problem hypotheses include

  (1) △ABC ∼ △PAQ  and  (2) △ABQ ∼ △QCP.

A very natural way to “label” the correspondences (which eventually leads to the answer) is as follows. (One may show that with the hypotheses below one may in fact prove that – somewhat unexpectedly – triangle ABC is isosceles.)

Step 1. In the similarity (1) one “chooses” the correspondence

  A → P, B → A, C → Q.

That is, think of a spiral–similarity with center A carrying side AB into segment AP and side AC into segment AQ. (It is not hard to prove that, with this correspondence, one may prove that

  m∠P = m∠(at P in △PAQ) = m∠A (in △ABC) = 70°.)

Now, if we let m∠ABC = B and m∠ACB = C, then
  70° + B + C = 180°  so that C = 110° – B.
Also by the similarity the angle at A in △PAQ equals m∠B in △ABC so that

  m∠A (in △PAQ) = B.

Step 2. In similarity (2) one “chooses” the correspondence

  A → Q, B → C, Q → P.

Then the angles of △ABQ and △QCP correspond, so that
  • m∠A in △ABQ = m∠Q in △QCP,
  • m∠B in △ABQ = m∠C in △QCP,
  • m∠Q in △ABQ = m∠P in △QCP.
But observe that (since Q lies on side BC of △ABC) we have
  m∠ABQ = m∠ABC = B.
Next, one shows that the ray AQ (which already appears in similarity (1)) forms, at A, the same angle with AB as does the image of AB (namely, the ray AP); that is,
  m∠BAQ = 70° – B.
Thus, in triangle ABQ the angles are
  m∠A = 70° – B, m∠B = B, and m∠Q = 180° – [(70° – B) + B] = 110°.
Then, by the correspondence in (2) we learn that in △QCP

  m∠P = 110° , m∠C = B , and m∠Q = 70° – B.

So, one obtains

  m∠PQC = m∠Q (in △QCP) = 70° – B.
                                     (∗)

Step 3. At this point one may prove (using the fact that P is chosen to be the midpoint of AC – as in the given Asymptote code – and some standard sine–law arguments in the two similar triangles) that there is no “free parameter” B but that one must have B = 35°. (In other words one may show that the given similarities force triangle ABC to be isosceles with AB = AC so that m∠ABC = m∠ACB = 35°.)

Then by (∗) we deduce that

  m∠PQC = 70° – 35° = 35°.

Thus one may answer 35°.

Remark. Although the “correct” answer – namely, 35° – might be found by an inspired “angle–chasing” (or an involved “sine–law” computation) the key is to choose correspondences in the two similarities so that the common points (A, P, Q, C – note that Q lies on BC and P is the midpoint of AC) force one to “pin down” the measure B. Many contestants have discovered that the conditions imply that triangle ABC is isosceles with base BC.

Answer: 35°.

_________________________________

To summarize:

– We assume m∠A = 70°.
– Choosing the similarities’ correspondences as above forces m∠ABC = m∠ACB = 35°.
– A short calculation then shows that m∠PQC = 70° – 35° = 35°.

So the answer is 35°.
