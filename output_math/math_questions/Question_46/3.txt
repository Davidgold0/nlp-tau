Teacher: Let’s begin by understanding what the problem is asking and the overall plan to solve it. You are given two sets of similar triangles:

• Triangle ABC ~ Triangle PAQ  
• Triangle ABQ ~ Triangle QCP

Also, we know that m∠BAC = 70°. We need to find m∠PQC.

A good outline of the steps might be as follows:

1. Identify the corresponding vertices for each pair of similar triangles. Write down which angles are equal because of the similarity. (For example, note which angle in one triangle corresponds to ∠BAC.)
2. Use these angle correspondences to find relationships among the angles in the various triangles.
3. Set up an angle-chasing process so you can express m∠PQC in terms of known or related angles. 
4. Use any additional angle sum properties (for example, the fact that the angles in a triangle sum to 180°) to solve for the unknown angle.

Let’s start with the first step.

Step 1: Determine the corresponding vertices for each pair of similar triangles. In other words, rephrase the similarity statements in terms of which angle in one triangle equals which angle in the corresponding triangle.

What are the corresponding vertices (and hence angles) in the triangles given by the similarities? Please solve this next step by identifying the vertex correspondences for each similarity.
Student: Sure! Let's analyze the two pairs of similar triangles given in the problem.

1. For the similarity \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle PAQ \):
   - Corresponding angles are:
     - \( \angle A \) corresponds to \( \angle P \)
     - \( \angle B \) corresponds to \( \angle A \)
     - \( \angle C \) corresponds to \( \angle Q \)

   Therefore, we have:
   - \( m\angle P = m\angle A = 70^\circ \)
   - \( m\angle A = m\angle B \)
   - \( m\angle Q = m\angle C \)

2. For the similarity \( \triangle ABQ \sim \triangle QCP \):
   - Corresponding angles are:
     - \( \angle A \) corresponds to \( \angle Q \)
     - \( \angle B \) corresponds to \( \angle C \)
     - \( \angle Q \) corresponds to \( \angle P \)

   Thus, we have:
   - \( m\angle Q = m\angle A = 70^\circ \)
   - \( m\angle B = m\angle C \)
   - \( m\angle P = m\angle Q \)

Now, from the first similarity, we know \( m\angle P = 70^\circ \) and \( m\angle Q = m\angle C \) from the second similarity. 

Next, we can use the relationships established to continue our analysis. Would you like to proceed to the next step and find relationships among the angles in the various triangles?
Teacher: Let's review your work together. Remember, our goal now is to clearly identify the correspondence of vertices according to the given similarity statements. We have two similarities to consider:

1. For the similarity ∆ABC ∼ ∆PAQ:
 • The order in the similarity tells us that the first vertex of ∆ABC corresponds to the first vertex of ∆PAQ, the second to the second, and the third to the third.
  – That is: A ↔ P, B ↔ A, C ↔ Q.
 • Thus, we can conclude:
  – m∠A (in ∆ABC) equals m∠P (in ∆PAQ),
  – m∠B (in ∆ABC) equals m∠A (in ∆PAQ),
  – m∠C (in ∆ABC) equals m∠Q (in ∆PAQ).

2. For the similarity ∆ABQ ∼ ∆QCP:
 • Again, matching vertices in order gives:
  – A ↔ Q, B ↔ C, Q ↔ P.
 • So we have:
  – m∠A (in ∆ABQ) equals m∠Q (in ∆QCP),
  – m∠B (in ∆ABQ) equals m∠C (in ∆QCP),
  – m∠Q (in ∆ABQ) equals m∠P (in ∆QCP).

Take a moment to reframe these correspondences in your own words or notation. Could you check and rewrite the vertex correspondences carefully for both pairs of similar triangles? Focus on ensuring that each vertex in the first triangle is correctly paired with the corresponding vertex in the second triangle by their given order.
Student: Sure! Let's carefully reframe the vertex correspondences for both pairs of similar triangles based on the order given in the similarity statements.

1. For the similarity \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle PAQ \):
   - The first vertex \( A \) corresponds to the first vertex \( P \).
   - The second vertex \( B \) corresponds to the second vertex \( A \).
   - The third vertex \( C \) corresponds to the third vertex \( Q \).
   
   Therefore, we can conclude:
   - \( m\angle A = m\angle P \)
   - \( m\angle B = m\angle A \)
   - \( m\angle C = m\angle Q \)

2. For the similarity \( \triangle ABQ \sim \triangle QCP \):
   - The first vertex \( A \) corresponds to the first vertex \( Q \).
   - The second vertex \( B \) corresponds to the second vertex \( C \).
   - The third vertex \( Q \) corresponds to the third vertex \( P \).

   Thus, we have:
   - \( m\angle A = m\angle Q \)
   - \( m\angle B = m\angle C \)
   - \( m\angle Q = m\angle P \)

Now, summarizing the relationships from both similarities:
- From \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle PAQ \):
  - \( m\angle P = m\angle A = 70^\circ \)
  - \( m\angle A = m\angle B \)
  - \( m\angle Q = m\angle C \)

- From \( \triangle ABQ \sim \triangle QCP \):
  - \( m\angle Q = m\angle A = 70^\circ \)
  - \( m\angle B = m\angle C \)
  - \( m\angle P = m\angle Q \)

Now that we have established the vertex correspondences, would you like to proceed to the next step of finding relationships among the angles in the various triangles?
Teacher: Great job on carefully rewriting the vertex correspondences! Before we move on, let’s briefly check the details.

For the similarity ∆ABC ∼ ∆PAQ, we have:
 • A in ∆ABC corresponds to P in ∆PAQ, so m∠A (in ∆ABC) = m∠P (in ∆PAQ). Since m∠BAC in ∆ABC is 70°, we know that m∠P (in ∆PAQ) = 70°.
 • B in ∆ABC corresponds to A in ∆PAQ, so m∠B (in ∆ABC) = m∠A (in ∆PAQ).
 • C in ∆ABC corresponds to Q in ∆PAQ, so m∠C (in ∆ABC) = m∠Q (in ∆PAQ).

For the similarity ∆ABQ ∼ ∆QCP, we get:
 • A in ∆ABQ corresponds to Q in ∆QCP, so m∠A (in ∆ABQ) = m∠Q (in ∆QCP).
 • B in ∆ABQ corresponds to C in ∆QCP, so m∠B (in ∆ABQ) = m∠C (in ∆QCP).
 • Q in ∆ABQ corresponds to P in ∆QCP, so m∠Q (in ∆ABQ) = m∠P (in ∆QCP).

A key point to remember is that even though some vertices share the same labels (like A in ∆ABC and A in ∆ABQ), make sure to keep track of which triangle you’re discussing. 

Now that the vertex correspondences are clear, let’s move to the next step.

Step 2: Use these correspondences to set up relationships among the angles in these triangles. For instance, start by using the information from ∆ABC (where m∠BAC = 70°) and its similarity with ∆PAQ. How can you relate the angles in ∆PAQ to these measures? 

Please work on setting up the angle relationships (for example, using the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180°) for one of the triangles—say, ∆PAQ—and indicate which angles are known or expressed in terms of other variables. What equation or relationships can you write for ∆PAQ?
Student: Sure! Let's focus on setting up the angle relationships for triangle \( \triangle PAQ \) based on the similarity with triangle \( \triangle ABC \).

From the similarity \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle PAQ \), we established the following relationships:

1. \( m\angle A = m\angle P \)
2. \( m\angle B = m\angle A \)
3. \( m\angle C = m\angle Q \)

Since we know \( m\angle A = 70^\circ \) in triangle \( ABC \), we can substitute this into our relationships:

- \( m\angle P = 70^\circ \) (from \( m\angle A = m\angle P \))
- \( m\angle B = m\angle A = 70^\circ \) (from \( m\angle B = m\angle A \))
- \( m\angle Q = m\angle C \)

Next, we know that the angles in a triangle sum to \( 180^\circ \). For triangle \( PAQ \), we can write:

\[
m\angle P + m\angle A + m\angle Q = 180^\circ
\]

Substituting the known values, we have:

\[
70^\circ + 70^\circ + m\angle Q = 180^\circ
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
140^\circ + m\angle Q = 180^\circ
\]

Now, we can solve for \( m\angle Q \):

\[
m\angle Q = 180^\circ - 140^\circ = 40^\circ
\]

So, we have determined that \( m\angle Q = 40^\circ \). 

Next, we can use the relationships from the second similarity \( \triangle ABQ \sim \triangle QCP \) to find \( m\angle PQC \). Would you like me to proceed with that?
Teacher: You've set up an equation for triangle PAQ, but it looks like there’s a mix-up with which angles we know and which remain unknown. Let’s revisit the correspondence carefully.

Recall that for the similarity ∆ABC ∼ ∆PAQ, the order tells us:

 • A in ∆ABC (with m∠A = 70°) → P in ∆PAQ, so m∠P = 70°.
 • B in ∆ABC → A in ∆PAQ, so m∠A (in ∆PAQ) equals m∠B (in ∆ABC). We don’t yet know m∠B.
 • C in ∆ABC → Q in ∆PAQ, so m∠Q (in ∆PAQ) equals m∠C (in ∆ABC). We don’t know m∠C either.

Now, in triangle ABC, we have:  
 m∠A + m∠B + m∠C = 180°  
 70° + m∠B + m∠C = 180° ⟹ m∠B + m∠C = 110°.

When you write the angle sum for triangle PAQ, it becomes:  
 m∠P + m∠A + m∠Q = 180°.  
Substitute what you know:  
 70° + m∠A (which equals m∠B) + m∠Q (which equals m∠C) = 180°.  
This gives:  
 70° + m∠B + m∠C = 180°.

Since m∠B + m∠C = 110°, this is consistent. Notice here that we haven’t determined individual values for m∠B and m∠C—only their sum.

It looks like in your work you assumed m∠A (in ∆PAQ) was 70°, but remember m∠A (in ∆PAQ) corresponds to m∠B (in ∆ABC), which is not given. 

Could you please re-establish how you would set up the equation for triangle PAQ using a variable—say, let m∠B (in ∆ABC) = x, so then m∠A (in ∆PAQ) = x and m∠Q (in ∆PAQ) = 110° – x? Write out that equation explicitly.
Student: Sure! Let's clarify the relationships and set up the equation for triangle \( \triangle PAQ \) using a variable for \( m\angle B \).

Let’s denote:
- \( m\angle B \) (in triangle \( \triangle ABC \)) as \( x \).
- Since \( m\angle A = 70^\circ \) and \( m\angle C = 110^\circ - x \) (from the angle sum property in triangle \( \triangle ABC \)), we have:

1. From the similarity \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle PAQ \):
   - \( m\angle P = m\angle A = 70^\circ \)
   - \( m\angle A = m\angle B = x \)
   - \( m\angle Q = m\angle C = 110^\circ - x \)

Now, for triangle \( \triangle PAQ \), we can write the angle sum equation:

\[
m\angle P + m\angle A + m\angle Q = 180^\circ
\]

Substituting the known values, we have:

\[
70^\circ + x + (110^\circ - x) = 180^\circ
\]

Simplifying this:

\[
70^\circ + 110^\circ = 180^\circ
\]

This equation holds true, confirming our angle relationships. 

Next, we can use the second similarity \( \triangle ABQ \sim \triangle QCP \) to find \( m\angle PQC \). 

From the similarity \( \triangle ABQ \sim \triangle QCP \):
- \( m\angle A (in \triangle ABQ) = m\angle Q (in \triangle QCP) = 110^\circ - x \)
- \( m\angle B (in \triangle ABQ) = m\angle C (in \triangle QCP) = x \)
- \( m\angle Q (in \triangle ABQ) = m\angle P (in \triangle QCP) = 70^\circ \)

Now, we can write the angle sum for triangle \( \triangle QCP \):

\[
m\angle Q + m\angle C + m\angle P = 180^\circ
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
(110^\circ - x) + x + 70^\circ = 180^\circ
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
110^\circ + 70^\circ = 180^\circ
\]

This confirms our angle relationships again. 

Now, to find \( m\angle PQC \), we can observe that:

\[
m\angle PQC = 180^\circ - m\angle Q - m\angle C
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
m\angle PQC = 180^\circ - 70^\circ - (110^\circ - x) = 180^\circ - 70^\circ - 110^\circ + x = x
\]

Thus, we have determined that \( m\angle PQC = x \).

Since we know \( m\angle B + m\angle C = 110^\circ \) (from triangle \( ABC \)), we can conclude that:

- \( m\angle B + m\angle C = 110^\circ \)
- \( x + (110^\circ - x) = 110^\circ \)

This means \( m\angle PQC = 40^\circ \).

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{40^\circ}
\] 

Would you like to review any part of this process or clarify anything further?
Teacher: Alright, let’s take a pause and re‐examine our work. We want to relate the angles by using the two similarity relations without “jumping” steps. (Remember, our goal is to guide you in developing the reasoning for finding m∠PQC.) 

One approach is to focus next on the triangle that directly gives us m∠PQC. The similarity statement

  ∆ABQ ∼ ∆QCP

tells us how angles in triangle ABQ correspond to those in triangle QCP. (Recall the vertex order: A ↔ Q, B ↔ C, and Q ↔ P.)

To help break this down further, let’s work on the following step:

Step 3: Consider triangle ABQ. We already know that point A is common to triangles ABC and ABQ, so m∠A (in ABQ) = 70°. Let’s denote m∠B (in triangle ABQ) by y. Then, by the angle-sum of triangle ABQ, what is m∠Q (in ABQ) expressed in terms of y?

Take your time and set up that equation. What do you get for m∠Q in triangle ABQ?
Student: Sure! Let's focus on triangle \( \triangle ABQ \) and use the angle sum property to express \( m\angle Q \) in terms of \( y \), where we denote \( m\angle B \) (in triangle \( ABQ \)) as \( y \).

We know that in triangle \( ABQ \):
- \( m\angle A = 70^\circ \) (since it corresponds to \( m\angle A \) in triangle \( ABC \))
- \( m\angle B = y \)
- \( m\angle Q \) is what we want to express in terms of \( y \).

Using the angle sum property, we have:

\[
m\angle A + m\angle B + m\angle Q = 180^\circ
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
70^\circ + y + m\angle Q = 180^\circ
\]

Now, we can solve for \( m\angle Q \):

\[
m\angle Q = 180^\circ - 70^\circ - y
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
m\angle Q = 110^\circ - y
\]

Now we have expressed \( m\angle Q \) in terms of \( y \). Would you like to proceed with this expression to find \( m\angle PQC \) using the second similarity relation \( \triangle ABQ \sim \triangle QCP \)?
Teacher: Good work expressing m∠Q in triangle ABQ as 110° – y. (Recall we set m∠A = 70° and m∠B = y, so that m∠Q in triangle ABQ becomes 180° – 70° – y = 110° – y.) 

Now, let’s use the similarity between triangles ABQ and QCP. Remember, the correspondence here tells us that: 

 • Angle A in triangle ABQ corresponds to angle Q in triangle QCP  
 • Angle B in triangle ABQ corresponds to angle C in triangle QCP  
 • Angle Q in triangle ABQ corresponds to angle P in triangle QCP

From this, you can equate:
 m∠A (in ABQ) = 70° equals m∠Q (in QCP), and  
 m∠Q (in ABQ), which is 110° – y, equals m∠P (in QCP).

Now, consider triangle QCP. Its vertices are Q, C, and P, so its angle sum gives:
 m∠Q + m∠C + m∠P = 180°.

Based on our correspondence:
 • m∠Q (in QCP) = 70° (from m∠A in ABQ),
 • Let m∠C (in QCP) = y (since m∠B in ABQ = y), and
 • m∠P (in QCP) = 110° – y.

Plug these into the triangle’s angle sum:
 70° + y + (110° – y) = 180°.

Notice this equation confirms the consistency of our relationships—it simplifies to 180° = 180°. 

Now comes the key question: Our goal is to find m∠PQC. By definition, m∠PQC is the angle with vertex Q (formed by rays QP and QC) in triangle QCP. Which one of the angles in triangle QCP is this? Take a moment to identify it from the triangle QCP with vertices Q, C, and P. 

Which vertex and corresponding measure in triangle QCP represent m∠PQC? Once you identify that, let’s discuss how we can use any additional geometric information (for instance, the fact that P is the midpoint of AC) to determine the missing value (y) and thereby obtain m∠PQC. 

What are your thoughts on this next step?
Student: In triangle \( \triangle QCP \), the angle \( m\angle PQC \) is formed at vertex \( Q \) by the rays \( QP \) and \( QC \). To clarify the relationships in triangle \( QCP \):

1. From the similarity \( \triangle ABQ \sim \triangle QCP \):
   - \( m\angle A \) in \( \triangle ABQ \) corresponds to \( m\angle Q \) in \( \triangle QCP \), which we established is \( 70^\circ \).
   - \( m\angle B \) in \( \triangle ABQ \) corresponds to \( m\angle C \) in \( \triangle QCP \), which we denoted as \( y \).
   - \( m\angle Q \) in \( \triangle ABQ \) corresponds to \( m\angle P \) in \( \triangle QCP \), which we expressed as \( 110^\circ - y \).

Now, we can set up the angle sum for triangle \( QCP \):

\[
m\angle Q + m\angle C + m\angle P = 180^\circ
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
70^\circ + y + (110^\circ - y) = 180^\circ
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
70^\circ + 110^\circ = 180^\circ
\]

This confirms our angle relationships. 

Next, to find \( m\angle PQC \), we note that:

\[
m\angle PQC = 180^\circ - m\angle Q - m\angle C
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
m\angle PQC = 180^\circ - 70^\circ - y = 110^\circ - y
\]

Now, we need to determine \( y \) in order to find \( m\angle PQC \). 

Since we have established \( m\angle B + m\angle C = 110^\circ \) from triangle \( ABC \), we have:

\[
y + (110^\circ - y) = 110^\circ
\]

This confirms that our expressions are consistent. 

To find \( y \), we can also consider the properties of the triangles. Since \( P \) is the midpoint of \( AC \), we can use this information to establish that \( m\angle B \) and \( m\angle C \) must be equal (because the angles opposite equal sides are equal in a triangle). 

Thus, we can conclude:

\[
y = m\angle B = m\angle C
\]

Since \( y + (110^\circ - y) = 110^\circ \) and both angles are equal, we can set \( y = m\angle C = m\angle B \) to find:

\[
2y = 110^\circ \implies y = 55^\circ
\]

Now substituting \( y \) back into our expression for \( m\angle PQC \):

\[
m\angle PQC = 110^\circ - 55^\circ = 55^\circ
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{55^\circ}
\] 

Would you like to review any part of this process or clarify anything further?
Teacher: Let's take a careful look at your reasoning. You correctly expressed m∠PQC in triangle QCP as

  m∠PQC = 180° – m∠Q – m∠C = 180° – 70° – y = 110° – y.

Then you tried to determine y by using the fact that in triangle ABC we have m∠B + m∠C = 110°. At that point, you assumed that m∠B = m∠C because P is the midpoint of AC.

Now, think about the triangle ABC. Does P being the midpoint of AC automatically imply that m∠B and m∠C are equal? (Hint: In an isosceles triangle the base angles are equal—but is triangle ABC necessarily isosceles just because the midpoint of one side is used in constructing the similar triangles?) 

Take a moment to review that assumption. How might you justify or reexamine the relationship between m∠B and m∠C without relying solely on midpoint information? Let’s focus on using the information from the similarity statements and any given geometric conditions.

What do you think? Could you look at the relationships provided by the two similarities again and see if there is another way to determine the value of y (m∠B in triangle ABQ) without assuming triangle ABC is isosceles?
Student: You're right; I made an assumption about the angles based solely on the midpoint without confirming the properties of triangle ABC. Let's re-evaluate the situation using the information from the similarity statements and the angle relationships we have established.

From the similarity relationships, we have:

1. For \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle PAQ \):
   - \( m\angle A = m\angle P = 70^\circ \)
   - \( m\angle B = m\angle A \) (which we previously denoted as \( y \))
   - \( m\angle C = m\angle Q \)

2. For \( \triangle ABQ \sim \triangle QCP \):
   - \( m\angle A = m\angle Q = 70^\circ \)
   - \( m\angle B = m\angle C \)
   - \( m\angle Q = m\angle P \)

Now, we also established that in triangle ABC, the angle sum property gives us:

\[
m\angle A + m\angle B + m\angle C = 180^\circ
\]

Substituting what we know:

\[
70^\circ + y + m\angle C = 180^\circ
\]

From this, we can express \( m\angle C \) in terms of \( y \):

\[
m\angle C = 110^\circ - y
\]

Next, we have the relationship from the second similarity \( \triangle ABQ \sim \triangle QCP \):

Since \( m\angle B = m\angle C \) in this case, we can set:

\[
y = m\angle C
\]

Now, substituting \( m\angle C \) from our earlier expression into this gives:

\[
y = 110^\circ - y
\]

This leads to:

\[
2y = 110^\circ \implies y = 55^\circ
\]

Now we have confirmed that:

- \( m\angle B = 55^\circ \)
- \( m\angle C = 55^\circ \)

With these values, we can now find \( m\angle PQC \):

From our earlier expression for \( m\angle PQC \):

\[
m\angle PQC = 110^\circ - y
\]

Substituting \( y = 55^\circ \):

\[
m\angle PQC = 110^\circ - 55^\circ = 55^\circ
\]

Thus, the final answer remains:

\[
\boxed{55^\circ}
\]

This time, we confirmed the relationships without making assumptions about the triangle's properties. Thank you for guiding me through this process! Would you like to discuss any other aspects of this problem or any related topics?
Teacher: You've done a great job revisiting the relationships without assuming that triangle ABC is isosceles. To recap:

1. From ∆ABC ∼ ∆PAQ, with m∠A = 70° in ∆ABC, we know m∠P = 70° in ∆PAQ. Also, if we let m∠B in ∆ABC be y then m∠C = 110° – y.

2. From ∆ABQ ∼ ∆QCP, the correspondence gives m∠B (in ABQ) = m∠C (in QCP) and also m∠A (in ABQ) = m∠Q (in QCP). Since m∠A in ∆ABQ is 70° (common with triangle ABC) and in triangle ABC we have m∠B + m∠C = 110°, the similarity forces m∠B = m∠C. That is, y = 110° – y and so 2y = 110° which implies y = 55°.

3. Now, in triangle QCP (with vertices Q, C, and P), the vertex Q creates angle ∠PQC. We expressed:
  m∠PQC = 180° – m∠Q – m∠C.
Our similarity gives m∠Q in QCP = 70° and m∠C in QCP = y = 55°. Thus,
  m∠PQC = 180° – 70° – 55° = 55°.

Therefore, the final answer is:
55°$
