Question: Given that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the roots of $x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0,$ find $5 \alpha^4 + 12 \beta^3.$
Teacher: Let's begin by breaking the problem down. We have the quadratic equation x² - 2x - 1 = 0 with roots α and β, and we're asked to find 5α⁴ + 12β³. Here’s an outline of the steps we might take:

1. Find the roots α and β of the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.
2. Once you have the roots, consider how to compute α⁴ and β³. (Hint: You might need to raise the expressions for the roots to the appropriate powers.)
3. Multiply α⁴ by 5 and β³ by 12.
4. Add the results to get the final expression.

Let's start with the very first step. Could you please use the quadratic formula to find the roots α and β of the equation x² - 2x - 1 = 0? Tell me what you get for each root.
Student: To find the roots \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) of the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula, we start by identifying the coefficients:

- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = -2 \)
- \( c = -1 \)

The quadratic formula is given by:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Now, let's calculate \( b^2 - 4ac \):

\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 4 + 4 = 8
\]

Now we can substitute back into the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-(-2) \pm \sqrt{8}}{2(1)} = \frac{2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Thus, the roots are:

\[
\alpha = 1 + \sqrt{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \beta = 1 - \sqrt{2}
\]

Would you like me to proceed to the next step of calculating \( \alpha^4 \) and \( \beta^3 \)?
Teacher: Great work finding the roots correctly! Now, let’s move on to the next step. We need to compute α⁴ and β³ based on the values we found (α = 1 + √2 and β = 1 − √2). 

Take one of these—say, α—to calculate α⁴. How would you go about expanding (1 + √2)⁴? (You might consider using the binomial theorem.) Please show your work for this step.
Student: To calculate \( \alpha^4 \) where \( \alpha = 1 + \sqrt{2} \), I can use the binomial theorem, which states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \( a = 1 \), \( b = \sqrt{2} \), and \( n = 4 \). So we have:

\[
(1 + \sqrt{2})^4 = \sum_{k=0}^{4} \binom{4}{k} (1)^{4-k} (\sqrt{2})^k
\]

Calculating each term of the sum:

- For \( k = 0 \): \( \binom{4}{0} (1)^4 (\sqrt{2})^0 = 1 \)
- For \( k = 1 \): \( \binom{4}{1} (1)^3 (\sqrt{2})^1 = 4\sqrt{2} \)
- For \( k = 2 \): \( \binom{4}{2} (1)^2 (\sqrt{2})^2 = 6 \cdot 2 = 12 \)
- For \( k = 3 \): \( \binom{4}{3} (1)^1 (\sqrt{2})^3 = 4 \cdot 2\sqrt{2} = 8\sqrt{2} \)
- For \( k = 4 \): \( \binom{4}{4} (1)^0 (\sqrt{2})^4 = 1 \cdot 4 = 4 \)

Now, putting all the terms together:

\[
(1 + \sqrt{2})^4 = 1 + 4\sqrt{2} + 12 + 8\sqrt{2} + 4
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
= (1 + 12 + 4) + (4\sqrt{2} + 8\sqrt{2}) = 17 + 12\sqrt{2}
\]

So, we find that:

\[
\alpha^4 = 17 + 12\sqrt{2}
\]

Now, would you like me to calculate \( \beta^3 \) next?
Teacher: Excellent work calculating α⁴! Now, let's move on to finding β³ for β = 1 - √2. Using a similar approach—namely, the binomial theorem—could you expand (1 - √2)³? Remember to show each step of your work.
Student: To calculate \( \beta^3 \) where \( \beta = 1 - \sqrt{2} \), I will again use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -\sqrt{2} \), and \( n = 3 \). So we have:

\[
(1 - \sqrt{2})^3 = \sum_{k=0}^{3} \binom{3}{k} (1)^{3-k} (-\sqrt{2})^k
\]

Calculating each term of the sum:

- For \( k = 0 \): \( \binom{3}{0} (1)^3 (-\sqrt{2})^0 = 1 \)
- For \( k = 1 \): \( \binom{3}{1} (1)^2 (-\sqrt{2})^1 = -3\sqrt{2} \)
- For \( k = 2 \): \( \binom{3}{2} (1)^1 (-\sqrt{2})^2 = 3 \cdot 2 = 6 \)
- For \( k = 3 \): \( \binom{3}{3} (1)^0 (-\sqrt{2})^3 = -1 \cdot 2\sqrt{2} = -2\sqrt{2} \)

Now, putting all the terms together:

\[
(1 - \sqrt{2})^3 = 1 - 3\sqrt{2} + 6 - 2\sqrt{2}
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
= (1 + 6) + (-3\sqrt{2} - 2\sqrt{2}) = 7 - 5\sqrt{2}
\]

So, we find that:

\[
\beta^3 = 7 - 5\sqrt{2}
\]

Would you like me to proceed to the next step of calculating \( 5\alpha^4 + 12\beta^3 \) now?
Teacher: Great job so far! Now we have α⁴ = 17 + 12√2 and β³ = 7 − 5√2. The next step is to find 5α⁴ and 12β³, and then add the results together. Could you please calculate:

1. 5(17 + 12√2)
2. 12(7 − 5√2)

After you compute these, add them together. Give it a try and show your work for each multiplication and the final addition.
Student: To find \( 5\alpha^4 \) and \( 12\beta^3 \), I'll start with the calculations step by step.

1. **Calculating \( 5\alpha^4 \)**:
   \[
   5\alpha^4 = 5(17 + 12\sqrt{2}) = 5 \times 17 + 5 \times 12\sqrt{2}
   \]
   \[
   = 85 + 60\sqrt{2}
   \]

2. **Calculating \( 12\beta^3 \)**:
   \[
   12\beta^3 = 12(7 - 5\sqrt{2}) = 12 \times 7 - 12 \times 5\sqrt{2}
   \]
   \[
   = 84 - 60\sqrt{2}
   \]

3. **Adding the results**:
   Now, I will add \( 5\alpha^4 \) and \( 12\beta^3 \):
   \[
   5\alpha^4 + 12\beta^3 = (85 + 60\sqrt{2}) + (84 - 60\sqrt{2})
   \]
   \[
   = 85 + 84 + 60\sqrt{2} - 60\sqrt{2}
   \]
   \[
   = 169 + 0\sqrt{2} = 169
   \]

Thus, the final result is:
\[
5\alpha^4 + 12\beta^3 = 169
\]

Would you like me to summarize the entire solution or provide any further details?
Teacher: You've done an excellent job working through the problem! Let's briefly summarize our process together:

1. We started with the quadratic equation x² – 2x – 1 = 0 and used the quadratic formula to find its roots, α = 1 + √2 and β = 1 – √2.
2. You then expanded (1 + √2)⁴ using the binomial theorem and found that α⁴ = 17 + 12√2.
3. Next, you expanded (1 – √2)³ using the binomial theorem to obtain β³ = 7 – 5√2.
4. Finally, you computed 5α⁴ = 85 + 60√2 and 12β³ = 84 – 60√2, and upon adding them, the √2 terms cancelled, resulting in 169.

The final answer is:
169$
