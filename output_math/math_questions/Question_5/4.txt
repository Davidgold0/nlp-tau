Question: Given that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the roots of $x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0,$ find $5 \alpha^4 + 12 \beta^3.$
Teacher: Let's begin by outlining the steps to tackle this problem:

1. Write down the quadratic equation x² – 2x – 1 = 0 and identify the roots α and β. You can use the quadratic formula to find their explicit forms, or note any relationships (such as Vieta’s formulas) that might be useful.

2. Once you have α and β (or their relationships), notice that the expression we need to compute involves α raised to the fourth power and β raised to the third power. Consider how you might use the fact that α and β satisfy the quadratic equation to reduce these higher powers to lower ones.

3. Express α⁴ and β³ in terms of α and β (using the relation satisfied by the roots from the quadratic) so that they become easier to work with.

4. Finally, combine the expressions to compute 5α⁴ + 12β³.

Let’s start with the first step. Could you please find the roots of the quadratic equation x² – 2x – 1 = 0 using the quadratic formula (or by any method you prefer)? What do you get for α and β?
Student: To find the roots of the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0 \), I will use the quadratic formula, which is given by:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In this equation, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = -1 \).

Now, I will calculate the discriminant \( b^2 - 4ac \):

\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 4 + 4 = 8
\]

Now, substituting the values into the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-(-2) \pm \sqrt{8}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Thus, the roots are:

\[
\alpha = 1 + \sqrt{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \beta = 1 - \sqrt{2}
\]

Would you like me to proceed to the next step of expressing \( \alpha^4 \) and \( \beta^3 \) in terms of \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \)?
Teacher: Great work finding the roots! Now, let’s move on to the next step. Remember that because α and β are roots of the quadratic x² – 2x – 1 = 0, they satisfy the equation, which means you can express higher powers in terms of lower ones.

For example, if you plug α into the equation, you have:
  α² – 2α – 1 = 0  ⟹  α² = 2α + 1.
And similarly for β:
  β² = 2β + 1.

Our goal now is to express α⁴ and β³ in simpler terms. 

Let’s start with α⁴. How would you express α⁴ using the fact that α² = 2α + 1? Could you please work out what (α²)² gives you, and simplify the expression as much as you can?
Student: To express \( \alpha^4 \) using the relationship \( \alpha^2 = 2\alpha + 1 \), I will first calculate \( \alpha^4 \) as follows:

\[
\alpha^4 = (\alpha^2)^2
\]

Now substituting the expression for \( \alpha^2 \):

\[
\alpha^4 = (2\alpha + 1)^2
\]

Now, expanding this expression:

\[
\alpha^4 = (2\alpha + 1)(2\alpha + 1) = 4\alpha^2 + 4\alpha + 1
\]

Next, I will substitute \( \alpha^2 = 2\alpha + 1 \) into this equation:

\[
\alpha^4 = 4(2\alpha + 1) + 4\alpha + 1
\]

Distributing the 4:

\[
\alpha^4 = 8\alpha + 4 + 4\alpha + 1
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
\alpha^4 = 12\alpha + 5
\]

So we have expressed \( \alpha^4 \) in terms of \( \alpha \):

\[
\alpha^4 = 12\alpha + 5
\]

Now, I will move on to finding \( \beta^3 \). We know that \( \beta^2 = 2\beta + 1 \). To find \( \beta^3 \), I can multiply \( \beta^2 \) by \( \beta \):

\[
\beta^3 = \beta \cdot \beta^2 = \beta(2\beta + 1) = 2\beta^2 + \beta
\]

Now substituting \( \beta^2 = 2\beta + 1 \) into this equation:

\[
\beta^3 = 2(2\beta + 1) + \beta = 4\beta + 2 + \beta = 5\beta + 2
\]

So we have expressed \( \beta^3 \) in terms of \( \beta \):

\[
\beta^3 = 5\beta + 2
\]

With both \( \alpha^4 \) and \( \beta^3 \) expressed in terms of \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \), I can now substitute these into the expression \( 5\alpha^4 + 12\beta^3 \). Would you like me to proceed with that?
Teacher: Great job on finding α⁴ = 12α + 5 and β³ = 5β + 2. Now, let's move on to the next step:

We need to compute the expression 5α⁴ + 12β³. Since you already have α⁴ and β³ in terms of α and β, please substitute these into the expression. That is, form the expression:

  5(12α + 5) + 12(5β + 2).

Once you've done that, simplify it as much as you can. A hint: You might want to use Vieta's formula (α + β = 2, from the quadratic equation) at some point to combine the terms involving α and β.

Could you please work out this substitution and simplification for the next step?
Student: Sure! Let's substitute the expressions for \( \alpha^4 \) and \( \beta^3 \) into the expression \( 5\alpha^4 + 12\beta^3 \):

We have:
\[
\alpha^4 = 12\alpha + 5
\]
\[
\beta^3 = 5\beta + 2
\]

Now substituting these into the expression:

\[
5\alpha^4 + 12\beta^3 = 5(12\alpha + 5) + 12(5\beta + 2)
\]

Now, let's expand both terms:

1. For \( 5(12\alpha + 5) \):
\[
5(12\alpha) + 5(5) = 60\alpha + 25
\]

2. For \( 12(5\beta + 2) \):
\[
12(5\beta) + 12(2) = 60\beta + 24
\]

Now, we can combine these results:

\[
5\alpha^4 + 12\beta^3 = 60\alpha + 25 + 60\beta + 24
\]

Combining like terms gives us:

\[
5\alpha^4 + 12\beta^3 = 60\alpha + 60\beta + 49
\]

Using Vieta's formulas, we know that \( \alpha + \beta = 2 \). Thus, we can substitute \( \alpha + \beta \) into our expression:

\[
60(\alpha + \beta) + 49 = 60(2) + 49 = 120 + 49 = 169
\]

So, the final result is:

\[
5\alpha^4 + 12\beta^3 = 169
\]

Would you like me to summarize or clarify anything further?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've successfully simplified the expressions and combined them correctly. You reached the result:

 60(α + β) + 49 = 60(2) + 49 = 120 + 49 = 169

Thus, the final answer is 169$
