Question: Find all values of $k$ so that the domain of_x000D_
\[b(x) = \frac{kx^2 + 2x - 5}{-5x^2 + 2x + k}\]is the set of all real numbers.
3o-mini: To determine the values of k for which the domain of

  b(x) = (kx² + 2x – 5) / (–5x² + 2x + k)

is all real numbers, we need the denominator to be nonzero for every real x.

Step 1. Examine the Denominator
The denominator is a quadratic function:
  d(x) = –5x² + 2x + k

For d(x) to be nonzero for all x, the quadratic must have no real roots.

Step 2. Use the Discriminant
A quadratic ax² + bx + c has no real roots when its discriminant is negative, i.e.,
  Δ = b² – 4ac < 0

Here, a = –5, b = 2, and c = k, so:
  Δ = (2)² – 4(–5)(k) = 4 + 20k

We require:
  4 + 20k < 0

Step 3. Solve the Inequality
Solve for k:
  20k < –4
  k < –4/20
  k < –1/5

Thus, when k < –1/5, the discriminant is negative and the denominator quadratic has no real roots. Therefore, the denominator never becomes zero and the function b(x) is defined for every x in ℝ.

Conclusion
The domain of b(x) is all real numbers provided that k < –1/5.

Answer: All values of k such that k < –1/5.
