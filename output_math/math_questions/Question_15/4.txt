Question: Find all values of $k$ so that the domain of_x000D_
\[b(x) = \frac{kx^2 + 2x - 5}{-5x^2 + 2x + k}\]is the set of all real numbers.
Teacher: Let's begin by rephrasing the problem in our own words. We have the function

  b(x) = (kx² + 2x – 5) / (–5x² + 2x + k).

We need to find all values of k such that the domain of b(x) is all real numbers. In other words, we want b(x) to be defined for every real number.

The key issue is when the denominator equals zero. So, to have the domain be all reals, the denominator must never be zero for any real x.

Step 1: Can you explain what condition the denominator must satisfy (with respect to its quadratic equation) in order for it never to be zero? Please focus just on that next step.
Student: Sure! To ensure that the denominator of the function \( b(x) = \frac{kx^2 + 2x - 5}{-5x^2 + 2x + k} \) is never zero for any real number \( x \), we need to analyze the quadratic equation in the denominator:

\[
-5x^2 + 2x + k.
\]

For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c \) to never be zero, its discriminant must be less than zero. The discriminant \( D \) is given by the formula:

\[
D = b^2 - 4ac.
\]

In our case, \( a = -5 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = k \). So, the discriminant is:

\[
D = 2^2 - 4(-5)(k) = 4 + 20k.
\]

To ensure that the denominator never equals zero, we need:

\[
4 + 20k < 0.
\]

This inequality will help us find the values of \( k \). Would you like me to solve this inequality next?
Teacher: Great explanation! Your next step is to solve the inequality 4 + 20k < 0 to find for which values of k this holds. Could you work through this step and tell me what inequality you get for k? Let's focus on isolating k in that inequality.
Student: Sure! Let's solve the inequality \( 4 + 20k < 0 \) step by step.

1. First, we will subtract 4 from both sides:

\[
20k < -4.
\]

2. Next, we will divide both sides by 20. Since 20 is positive, the direction of the inequality remains the same:

\[
k < -\frac{4}{20}.
\]

3. Simplifying the fraction gives us:

\[
k < -\frac{1}{5}.
\]

So, the inequality we have found is \( k < -\frac{1}{5} \). 

Would you like me to summarize the values of \( k \) that ensure the domain of \( b(x) \) is all real numbers?
Teacher: Your work so far looks great! To summarize what we've done:

• We noted that for b(x) to be defined for all real numbers, the denominator –5x² + 2x + k must never be zero.
• We realized that means the quadratic must have no real roots, which happens if its discriminant is less than zero.
• We computed the discriminant, D = 4 + 20k, and set up the inequality 4 + 20k < 0.
• Finally, by solving that inequality we reached k < -1/5.

Before proceeding to the final answer, please summarize your reasoning and state the final answer for k. What is your final statement on the values of k that work?
Student: Sure! Here’s a summary of my reasoning:

1. We started with the function \( b(x) = \frac{kx^2 + 2x - 5}{-5x^2 + 2x + k} \) and needed to find the values of \( k \) such that the domain of \( b(x) \) includes all real numbers.

2. We determined that the key issue was the denominator \( -5x^2 + 2x + k \) never being zero. 

3. To ensure this quadratic expression has no real roots, we calculated the discriminant, \( D = 4 + 20k \), and set the condition \( D < 0 \).

4. By solving the inequality \( 4 + 20k < 0 \), we found that \( k < -\frac{1}{5} \).

Thus, the final answer is that the values of \( k \) for which the domain of \( b(x) \) is all real numbers are:

\[
k < -\frac{1}{5}.
\]
Teacher: You've worked through the problem very well. Let's review the main points of our discussion:

• We began by noting that for the function b(x) = (kx² + 2x – 5) / (–5x² + 2x + k) to be defined for every real number, the denominator must never equal zero.
• Recognizing the denominator is a quadratic –5x² + 2x + k, we used the fact that a quadratic has no real roots if its discriminant, D = b² – 4ac, is less than 0.
• Plugging in the coefficients a = –5, b = 2, and c = k, the discriminant was found to be D = 4 + 20k.
• We set the inequality 4 + 20k < 0 and solved for k, arriving at k < –1/5.

Thus, the final answer on the values of k is: 

k < -1/5$
