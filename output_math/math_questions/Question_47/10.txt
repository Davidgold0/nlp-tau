Question: What is the average of all positive integers that have three digits when written in base $5$, but two digits when written in base $8$? Write your answer in base $10$.
3o-mini: To solve the problem, we first determine the range of positive integers that meet both conditions:

1. Three-digit numbers in base 5:
 • A three‐digit number in base 5 ranges from 100₅ to 444₅.
 • Convert these to base 10:
  – 100₅ = 1×5² + 0×5 + 0 = 25.
  – 444₅ = 4×5² + 4×5 + 4 = 4×25 + 20 + 4 = 100 + 20 + 4 = 124.
 • So, in base 10, numbers that have three digits in base 5 are from 25 to 124.

2. Two-digit numbers in base 8:
 • A two‐digit number in base 8 ranges from 10₈ to 77₈.
 • Convert these to base 10:
  – 10₈ = 1×8 + 0 = 8.
  – 77₈ = 7×8 + 7 = 56 + 7 = 63.
 • So, in base 10, numbers that have two digits in base 8 are from 8 to 63.

Now, we take the intersection of these two ranges. The number must be at least 25 (from the base‑5 condition) and at most 63 (from the base‑8 condition). Thus, the numbers we consider are those from 25 to 63 (inclusive).

To find the average of all integers from 25 to 63, we use the formula for the average of an arithmetic series, which is (first term + last term) / 2:
 Average = (25 + 63) / 2 = 88 / 2 = 44.

Thus, the average of all positive integers that satisfy the conditions is 44 (in base 10).
