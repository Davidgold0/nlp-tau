Question: What is the average of all positive integers that have three digits when written in base $5$, but two digits when written in base $8$? Write your answer in base $10$.
3o-mini: A positive integer has three digits in base 5 if it is between 100₅ and 444₅. Converting these to base 10:

• 100₅ = 1·5² + 0·5¹ + 0 = 25  
• 444₅ = 4·5² + 4·5¹ + 4 = 100 + 20 + 4 = 124

So, these integers are in the range 25 to 124 in base 10.

Similarly, a positive integer has two digits in base 8 if it is between 10₈ and 77₈. Converting to base 10:

• 10₈ = 1·8¹ + 0 = 8  
• 77₈ = 7·8¹ + 7 = 56 + 7 = 63

Thus, these integers are in the range 8 to 63 in base 10.

The numbers that meet both criteria must be in the intersection of the ranges 25 to 124 and 8 to 63, which is from 25 to 63.

To find the average of all numbers from 25 to 63 (inclusive), note that these numbers form an arithmetic sequence. The average of an arithmetic sequence is given by (first term + last term)/2:

  Average = (25 + 63)/2 = 88/2 = 44

Therefore, the average of all positive integers that have three digits when written in base 5 and two digits when written in base 8 is 44 (in base 10).
