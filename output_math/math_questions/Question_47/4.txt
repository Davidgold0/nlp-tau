Question: What is the average of all positive integers that have three digits when written in base $5$, but two digits when written in base $8$? Write your answer in base $10$.
Teacher: Let's begin by understanding the conditions step by step. First, let’s rephrase the problem in our own words:

We need to find the average (in base 10) of all positive integers that meet the following two conditions:
• They have exactly three digits when written in base 5.
• They have exactly two digits when written in base 8.

A good first step is to determine what numbers in base 10 correspond to having three digits in base 5.

Remember, the smallest three-digit number in any base is given by "100" in that base, and the largest is the one where every digit is the maximum allowed digit in that base (for base 5, that’s 4).

For base 5:
• What is the smallest three-digit number (written as 100 in base 5) in base 10?
• What is the largest three-digit number (written as 444 in base 5) in base 10?

Please calculate these two values in base 10 and share your work.
Student: Sure! Let's start with the smallest three-digit number in base 5, which is represented as "100" in that base.

To convert "100" from base 5 to base 10, we can expand it using the place values:
\[
100_5 = 1 \cdot 5^2 + 0 \cdot 5^1 + 0 \cdot 5^0 = 1 \cdot 25 + 0 \cdot 5 + 0 \cdot 1 = 25_{10}
\]

Next, let's find the largest three-digit number in base 5, which is represented as "444" in that base.

To convert "444" from base 5 to base 10, we do a similar expansion:
\[
444_5 = 4 \cdot 5^2 + 4 \cdot 5^1 + 4 \cdot 5^0 = 4 \cdot 25 + 4 \cdot 5 + 4 \cdot 1 = 100 + 20 + 4 = 124_{10}
\]

So, the smallest three-digit number in base 5 is \( 25_{10} \) and the largest is \( 124_{10} \). 

Now, I will summarize these findings:
- Smallest three-digit number in base 5: \( 25_{10} \)
- Largest three-digit number in base 5: \( 124_{10} \)

What should I do next?
Teacher: Great work on converting the base‑5 numbers into base 10. Now, let’s tackle the next step.

We need to determine the range for numbers that have exactly two digits when written in base 8. Remember:
• The smallest two-digit number in base 8 is “10” (in base 8).
• The largest two-digit number in base 8 is “77” (in base 8).

Your task now is to convert these two numbers—“10” and “77” in base 8—into base 10. Please show your work on these conversions.
Student: Sure! Let's start with the smallest two-digit number in base 8, which is represented as "10" in that base.

To convert "10" from base 8 to base 10, we can expand it using the place values:
\[
10_8 = 1 \cdot 8^1 + 0 \cdot 8^0 = 1 \cdot 8 + 0 \cdot 1 = 8_{10}
\]

Next, let's find the largest two-digit number in base 8, which is represented as "77" in that base.

To convert "77" from base 8 to base 10, we do a similar expansion:
\[
77_8 = 7 \cdot 8^1 + 7 \cdot 8^0 = 7 \cdot 8 + 7 \cdot 1 = 56 + 7 = 63_{10}
\]

So, the smallest two-digit number in base 8 is \( 8_{10} \) and the largest is \( 63_{10} \).

To summarize:
- Smallest two-digit number in base 8: \( 8_{10} \)
- Largest two-digit number in base 8: \( 63_{10} \)

Now, I have established the ranges for both conditions:
- The range for three-digit numbers in base 5 is from \( 25_{10} \) to \( 124_{10} \).
- The range for two-digit numbers in base 8 is from \( 8_{10} \) to \( 63_{10} \).

Next, I need to find the overlap between these two ranges. What should I do next?
Teacher: Excellent work so far! Now we need to find the intersection of the two ranges:

• For three-digit numbers in base 5, the range in base 10 is from 25 to 124.
• For two-digit numbers in base 8, the range in base 10 is from 8 to 63.

The intersection (overlap) of these two ranges will give us the numbers that satisfy both conditions. 

Please determine the interval that represents this overlap (i.e., find the smallest and largest numbers in base 10 that are common to both ranges). What is the intersection of these intervals?
Student: To find the intersection of the two ranges, we need to identify the smallest and largest numbers that fall within both ranges.

1. The range for three-digit numbers in base 5 is from \(25_{10}\) to \(124_{10}\).
2. The range for two-digit numbers in base 8 is from \(8_{10}\) to \(63_{10}\).

Now, let's determine the overlap:

- The smallest number in the intersection is the maximum of the lower bounds:
  \[
  \text{max}(25, 8) = 25
  \]

- The largest number in the intersection is the minimum of the upper bounds:
  \[
  \text{min}(124, 63) = 63
  \]

Thus, the intersection of the two ranges is:
\[
[25, 63]
\]

This means the numbers that satisfy both conditions are those integers from \(25\) to \(63\) inclusive. 

What should I do next?
Teacher: Great! Now that we've identified the overlapping interval as the numbers from 25 to 63 (inclusive), our next step is to compute the average of these integers.

Recall that when you have an arithmetic sequence (consecutive integers, in this case), the average can be computed as:
  Average = (first term + last term) / 2

Using this formula, please calculate the average of the numbers from 25 to 63. Show your work, and let me know your result.
Student: Sure! To calculate the average of the integers from 25 to 63 inclusive, we can use the formula for the average of an arithmetic sequence:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{first term} + \text{last term}}{2}
\]

Here, the first term is 25 and the last term is 63. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{25 + 63}{2}
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum in the numerator:

\[
25 + 63 = 88
\]

Next, we divide by 2 to find the average:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{88}{2} = 44
\]

Therefore, the average of all positive integers that have three digits in base 5 and two digits in base 8 is \( 44 \) in base 10.

Is there anything else you would like me to do?
Teacher: You've done a great job working through all the steps! Your final conclusion is that the average of the numbers from 25 to 63 is 44 in base 10.

Final Answer: 44$
