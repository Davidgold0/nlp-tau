Question: What is the average of all positive integers that have three digits when written in base $5$, but two digits when written in base $8$? Write your answer in base $10$.
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem. We need to find the average of all numbers that meet both of these criteria:

1. They have three digits when written in base 5.
2. They have two digits when written in base 8.

First, let's rephrase what these mean:

• For a three-digit number in base 5, the smallest number is written as 100₅ and the largest as 444₅.
• For a two-digit number in base 8, the possibilities range from 10₈ to 77₈.

Step 1: Let’s convert the smallest and largest three-digit numbers in base 5 (100₅ and 444₅) to base 10. 

Can you calculate what 100₅ and 444₅ are in base 10? Please show your working on this step.
Student: Sure! Let's start by converting the base 5 numbers to base 10.

1. **Convert \(100_5\) to base 10:**
   - The number \(100_5\) represents:
   \[
   1 \cdot 5^2 + 0 \cdot 5^1 + 0 \cdot 5^0 = 1 \cdot 25 + 0 \cdot 5 + 0 \cdot 1 = 25
   \]
   So, \(100_5 = 25_{10}\).

2. **Convert \(444_5\) to base 10:**
   - The number \(444_5\) represents:
   \[
   4 \cdot 5^2 + 4 \cdot 5^1 + 4 \cdot 5^0 = 4 \cdot 25 + 4 \cdot 5 + 4 \cdot 1 = 100 + 20 + 4 = 124
   \]
   So, \(444_5 = 124_{10}\).

Now we have the range of numbers in base 10: from 25 to 124. 

What should we do next?
Teacher: Great work on converting from base 5 to base 10! Now that we know the range from the three-digit base‐5 numbers is from 25 to 124 in base 10, let's move on to the next step:

Step 2: Convert the smallest and largest two-digit numbers in base 8 to base 10. In base 8, the smallest two-digit number is 10₈ and the largest is 77₈.

Could you calculate what 10₈ and 77₈ are in base 10? Please show your working on this step.
Student: Sure! Let's convert the base 8 numbers to base 10.

1. **Convert \(10_8\) to base 10:**
   - The number \(10_8\) represents:
   \[
   1 \cdot 8^1 + 0 \cdot 8^0 = 1 \cdot 8 + 0 \cdot 1 = 8
   \]
   So, \(10_8 = 8_{10}\).

2. **Convert \(77_8\) to base 10:**
   - The number \(77_8\) represents:
   \[
   7 \cdot 8^1 + 7 \cdot 8^0 = 7 \cdot 8 + 7 \cdot 1 = 56 + 7 = 63
   \]
   So, \(77_8 = 63_{10}\).

Now we have the range of numbers in base 10 for the two-digit base‐8 numbers: from 8 to 63. 

Next, what do we need to do to find the numbers that satisfy both conditions?
Teacher: Great work on converting the base 8 numbers! Now, to have a number that satisfies both conditions, it must be in both ranges we found. The three-digit base-5 numbers (in base 10) range from 25 to 124, and the two-digit base-8 numbers (in base 10) range from 8 to 63.

Step 3: Find the intersection of these ranges. In other words, identify the set of numbers that are common to both intervals. Could you determine what the overlapping range is? Please show your reasoning.
Student: Sure! To find the intersection of the two ranges we have:

1. The range for three-digit numbers in base 5 is from **25 to 124** (in base 10).
2. The range for two-digit numbers in base 8 is from **8 to 63** (in base 10).

Now, we need to find the overlapping part of these two ranges:

- The lower bound of the intersection will be the maximum of the two lower bounds: 
  - The lower bound from base 5 is 25.
  - The lower bound from base 8 is 8.
  
  So the maximum of 25 and 8 is **25**.

- The upper bound of the intersection will be the minimum of the two upper bounds:
  - The upper bound from base 5 is 124.
  - The upper bound from base 8 is 63.
  
  So the minimum of 124 and 63 is **63**.

Therefore, the overlapping range of numbers that satisfy both conditions is from **25 to 63**.

What should we do next?
Teacher: Excellent work finding the overlapping range! We now know that the numbers satisfying both conditions are those from 25 to 63 (inclusive).

Step 4: Our next task is to calculate the average of all integers in this range. To do that, consider these two approaches:

a. You could sum all the numbers from 25 to 63 and then divide by the total number of terms.
b. Or, recall that for an arithmetic sequence (with a common difference of 1), the average of the terms is simply the average of the first and last term.

Please choose one of these approaches and show me the next step in using it. What would be your next step?
Student: Student: I think using the second approach will be simpler since we have an arithmetic sequence. 

To find the average of the integers from 25 to 63, we can use the formula for the average of an arithmetic sequence, which is the average of the first and last terms. 

1. The first term (lower bound) is \(25\).
2. The last term (upper bound) is \(63\).

Now, we can calculate the average:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{First term} + \text{Last term}}{2} = \frac{25 + 63}{2}
\]

Let's calculate that:

\[
25 + 63 = 88
\]
\[
\frac{88}{2} = 44
\]

So, the average of all positive integers that have three digits when written in base 5 and two digits when written in base 8 is **44** in base 10.

Is there anything else I should check or clarify?
Teacher: Great job! Your calculation using the arithmetic sequence's average was spot on: (25 + 63)/2 equals 44 in base 10. Before we conclude, can you briefly summarize why taking the average of the first and last terms works in this situation? Once you've done that, we'll confirm your final answer.
Student: Student: Sure! The reason taking the average of the first and last terms works in this situation is because the numbers from 25 to 63 form an arithmetic sequence where each number increases by 1. 

In an arithmetic sequence, the average can be found by taking the mean of the first and last terms because the numbers are evenly distributed between them. Since there are no gaps or variations in the differences between consecutive numbers, this method gives us the correct average for all the integers in that range.

So, to summarize: The average of all integers from 25 to 63 is calculated by finding the average of the first term (25) and the last term (63), which results in 44. 

With that, I confirm that the average of all positive integers that have three digits when written in base 5 and two digits when written in base 8 is indeed **44** in base 10. Thank you for your guidance!
Teacher: That's an excellent summary! You've clearly explained that since the integers from 25 to 63 form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1, the average is simply the mean of the first and last terms: (25 + 63) / 2 = 44.

So the final answer is 44$
