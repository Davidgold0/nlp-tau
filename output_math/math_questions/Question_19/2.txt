Question: The operation $\clubsuit$ is defined by $x\clubsuit y =|x|^3+y$. What is the value of $2\clubsuit 4$?
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem step by step. The operation is defined as x clubsuit y = |x|³ + y. The question asks: What is the value of 2 clubsuit 4?

Step 1: Write down the expression for 2 clubsuit 4 using the definition.

What expression do you get when you substitute x = 2 and y = 4 into the definition? Please show your work for this step.
Student: Sure! According to the definition of the operation \( x \clubsuit y = |x|^3 + y \), we need to substitute \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 4 \).

So, the expression for \( 2 \clubsuit 4 \) becomes:

\[
2 \clubsuit 4 = |2|^3 + 4
\]

Now, I need to calculate \( |2|^3 \). Since \( |2| = 2 \), we have:

\[
|2|^3 = 2^3 = 8
\]

Now, substituting this back into the expression:

\[
2 \clubsuit 4 = 8 + 4
\]

What should I do next?
Teacher: Great job outlining the steps and simplifying to the expression:

  2 clubsuit 4 = |2|³ + 4 = 8 + 4

Now, the next step is to add 8 and 4 together. What do you get when you add these numbers? Please show your work for this addition.
Student: Student: Thank you! Now, I'll add \( 8 \) and \( 4 \) together.

\[
8 + 4 = 12
\]

Therefore, the value of \( 2 \clubsuit 4 \) is \( 12 \). 

Is there anything else you would like me to clarify?
Teacher: You've done an excellent job! Your calculation is correct. The final answer is 12$
