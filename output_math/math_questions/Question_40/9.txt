3o-mini: We begin by placing the points in the coordinate plane. According to the provided diagram:

• Let A = (0, 0)
• Let P = (4, 0)
• Let B = (4, 4)
• Let D = (4, –4) (so that P is the midpoint of BD)
• Let C = (12, –4)

Check that the given conditions hold:
1. AP = distance from (0,0) to (4,0) is 4.
2. BP = distance from (4,4) to (4,0) is 4.
3. AP ⟂ BD since AP is horizontal and BD is vertical.
4. BD ⟂ DC since BD is vertical and DC is horizontal (from D = (4, –4) to C = (12, –4)).
5. AB ⟂ BC which can be verified by checking the slopes of AB (from (0,0) to (4,4)) and BC (from (4,4) to (12, –4)). Their slopes are 1 and –1, respectively, whose product is –1.

Now, the pentagon's vertices (in order) are A, B, C, D, and P. We find the lengths of the sides:

1. AB:  
Distance from A (0,0) to B (4,4) is  
√[(4 – 0)² + (4 – 0)²] = √(16 + 16) = √32 = 4√2.

2. BC:  
Distance from B (4,4) to C (12,–4) is  
√[(12 – 4)² + (–4 – 4)²] = √(8² + (–8)²] = √(64 + 64) = √128 = 8√2.

3. CD:  
Distance from C (12,–4) to D (4,–4) is  
√[(4 – 12)² + (–4 – (–4))²] = √((–8)² + 0²] = 8.

4. DP:  
Distance from D (4,–4) to P (4,0) is  
√[(4 – 4)² + (0 – (–4))²] = √(0 + 4²] = 4.

5. PA:  
Distance from P (4,0) to A (0,0) is  
√[(0 – 4)² + (0 – 0)²] = √(4²) = 4.

Now add all the side lengths to get the perimeter:
AB + BC + CD + DP + PA = 4√2 + 8√2 + 8 + 4 + 4.

Combine like terms:
• The √2 terms: 4√2 + 8√2 = 12√2.
• The constant terms: 8 + 4 + 4 = 16.

Thus, the perimeter is 12√2 + 16.

The final answer in simple radical form is: 12√2 + 16.
