Question: What is the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $8x^2 - 38x + 35 = 0$? Express your answer as a decimal.
Teacher: Great! Let's start by outlining the steps we need to follow to solve this problem:

1. Rewrite the equation in the standard quadratic form (ax² + bx + c = 0) and identify the coefficients a, b, and c.
2. Write down the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a).
3. Substitute the coefficients into the formula and compute the discriminant (b² - 4ac).
4. Compute both solutions using the + and – in the formula.
5. Compare the solutions and choose the smallest value of x.
6. Express that smallest value as a decimal.

Now, let's begin with the first step:
Please identify the coefficients a, b, and c from the equation 8x² - 38x + 35 = 0. What values do you get?
Student: Sure! From the equation \(8x^2 - 38x + 35 = 0\), I can identify the coefficients as follows:

- \(a = 8\) (the coefficient of \(x^2\))
- \(b = -38\) (the coefficient of \(x\))
- \(c = 35\) (the constant term)

So, the coefficients are \(a = 8\), \(b = -38\), and \(c = 35\). What should I do next?
Teacher: Great job! You correctly identified a = 8, b = -38, and c = 35.

Now, please write down the quadratic formula used to solve quadratic equations. What does the quadratic formula look like?
Student: Sure! The quadratic formula used to solve quadratic equations is:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

This formula allows us to find the values of \(x\) for any quadratic equation in the standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). What should I do next?
Teacher: Excellent work so far! You've correctly written down the quadratic formula. Now, for the next step, please compute the discriminant, which is the expression under the square root in the quadratic formula. That is:

  discriminant = b² - 4ac

Using the coefficients a = 8, b = -38, and c = 35, please calculate this value. What do you get?
Student: To calculate the discriminant, I will use the formula \(b^2 - 4ac\) with the coefficients \(a = 8\), \(b = -38\), and \(c = 35\).

First, I will compute \(b^2\):
\[
b^2 = (-38)^2 = 1444
\]

Next, I will compute \(4ac\):
\[
4ac = 4 \cdot 8 \cdot 35 = 1120
\]

Now, I will subtract \(4ac\) from \(b^2\) to find the discriminant:
\[
\text{discriminant} = 1444 - 1120 = 324
\]

So, the value of the discriminant is \(324\). What should I do next?
Teacher: Great work calculating the discriminant! The next step is to compute the square root of the discriminant, √324. This value will then be used in the quadratic formula.

Please calculate √324 and provide its value. What do you get?
Student: To calculate the square root of the discriminant, \( \sqrt{324} \):

\[
\sqrt{324} = 18
\]

So, the value of \( \sqrt{324} \) is \( 18 \). What should I do next?
Teacher: Great job calculating the square root! We're making excellent progress.

Now, please substitute the values back into the quadratic formula:
  x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a).

With a = 8, b = -38, and √(b² - 4ac) = 18, the expression becomes:
  x = (-(-38) ± 18) / (2·8).

Please compute the two solutions (first the one with +, then with –) and simplify them. What do you get?
Student: To find the two solutions using the quadratic formula, I will substitute the values into the formula:

\[
x = \frac{-(-38) \pm 18}{2 \cdot 8}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = \frac{38 \pm 18}{16}
\]

Now, I will compute the two solutions:

1. **For the positive case (+):**
\[
x_1 = \frac{38 + 18}{16} = \frac{56}{16} = 3.5
\]

2. **For the negative case (−):**
\[
x_2 = \frac{38 - 18}{16} = \frac{20}{16} = 1.25
\]

So, the two solutions are \(x_1 = 3.5\) and \(x_2 = 1.25\). What should I do next?
Teacher: Excellent work finding the two solutions! Now let's compare them. Which value is smaller: 3.5 or 1.25? Please provide your answer for the smallest value of x.
Student: The smaller value between 3.5 and 1.25 is 1.25. 

Therefore, the smallest value of \(x\) that satisfies the equation \(8x^2 - 38x + 35 = 0\) is \(1.25\). 

Would you like me to express this value in any other format?
Teacher: You've done a wonderful job working through each step! Let's quickly summarize our process:

1. We identified the coefficients: a = 8, b = -38, c = 35.
2. We applied the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac))/(2a).
3. We computed the discriminant: 324.
4. We then found √324 = 18.
5. Substituting these into the quadratic formula gave us two solutions: 3.5 and 1.25.
6. Finally, we determined that the smallest value is 1.25.

Excellent work, and your final answer is: 1.25$
