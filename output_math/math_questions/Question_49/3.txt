Question: What is the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $8x^2 - 38x + 35 = 0$? Express your answer as a decimal.
Teacher: Let's begin by outlining the steps we would take to solve the quadratic equation 8x² - 38x + 35 = 0:

1. Identify the coefficients a, b, and c from the equation.
2. Write the quadratic formula: x = (−b ± √(b² − 4ac)) / (2a).
3. Calculate the discriminant (b² − 4ac).
4. Take the square root of the discriminant.
5. Substitute the values into the quadratic formula and solve for x.
6. Compare the two solutions and identify the smallest one, then express it as a decimal.

Let's start with the first step.

What are the values of a, b, and c in the equation 8x² − 38x + 35 = 0? Please provide your answer for this first step.
Student: The coefficients from the equation \(8x^2 - 38x + 35 = 0\) are:

- \(a = 8\)
- \(b = -38\)
- \(c = 35\)

Shall we move on to the next step?
Teacher: Great job identifying a, b, and c correctly!

Now, let's move on to the next step: Calculate the discriminant. The discriminant is given by b² - 4ac. Could you calculate this value using the coefficients you identified? Please share your computation for this step.
Student: Student: Sure! To calculate the discriminant \(b^2 - 4ac\), I will use the values we identified:

- \(b = -38\)
- \(a = 8\)
- \(c = 35\)

Now, I will compute it step by step:

1. Calculate \(b^2\):
   \[
   (-38)^2 = 1444
   \]

2. Calculate \(4ac\):
   \[
   4 \cdot 8 \cdot 35 = 1120
   \]

3. Now, subtract \(4ac\) from \(b^2\):
   \[
   1444 - 1120 = 324
   \]

So, the discriminant \(b^2 - 4ac\) is \(324\). 

Shall we proceed to the next step?
Teacher: Great job calculating the discriminant correctly! Now, for the next step, we need to take the square root of the discriminant. Could you compute the square root of 324 and show your work for that step?
Student: Student: Of course! To find the square root of the discriminant \(324\), I will perform the calculation:

\[
\sqrt{324} = 18
\]

So, the square root of the discriminant is \(18\). 

Shall we move on to the next step?
Teacher: Excellent work in finding the square root of the discriminant!

Now let's move on to the next step. The quadratic formula is:

  x = (–b ± √(b² – 4ac)) / (2a)

Given our coefficients and your findings, substituting them in gives:

  x = (38 ± 18) / 16

(Remember, –b becomes 38 because b is –38.)

Please use this to compute the two solutions. What do you get for each solution, and which one is the smallest? Share your work for this step.
Student: Student: Sure! Let's substitute the values into the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{38 \pm 18}{16}
\]

Now, I will calculate the two possible solutions:

1. **First Solution (using +18)**:
   \[
   x_1 = \frac{38 + 18}{16} = \frac{56}{16} = 3.5
   \]

2. **Second Solution (using -18)**:
   \[
   x_2 = \frac{38 - 18}{16} = \frac{20}{16} = 1.25
   \]

Now we have the two solutions:
- \(x_1 = 3.5\)
- \(x_2 = 1.25\)

The smallest value of \(x\) that satisfies the equation is \(1.25\).

Shall we summarize the final answer?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've successfully applied the quadratic formula step by step:

1. First, you identified the coefficients: a = 8, b = –38, and c = 35.
2. Then you computed the discriminant: b² – 4ac = 1444 – 1120 = 324.
3. You found the square root of the discriminant: √324 = 18.
4. Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, you got:
  x = (38 ± 18) / 16,
  which leads to two solutions: x₁ = 56/16 = 3.5 and x₂ = 20/16 = 1.25.
5. Since we are looking for the smallest value of x, the final answer is 1.25.

Final answer: 1.25$
