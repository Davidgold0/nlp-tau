Question: Nancy generates a two-digit integer by rolling a six-sided die twice. The result of her first roll is the tens digit, and the result of her second roll is the ones digit. What is the probability that the resulting integer is divisible by 8? Express your answer as a common fraction.
Teacher: Let's begin by breaking down the problem into several clear steps. First, let’s rephrase: Nancy makes a two-digit integer by rolling a six-sided die twice (first roll = tens digit, second roll = ones digit). We need to determine the probability that the number she generates is divisible by 8.

Here’s an outline of the steps we need to follow:

1. Determine the total number of possible two-digit numbers Nancy can generate.
2. Identify which of those numbers are divisible by 8.
3. Count the favorable outcomes.
4. Calculate the probability by dividing the favorable count by the total outcomes, and then simplify the fraction if needed.

Let's start with the first step. Can you determine the total number of outcomes (two-digit numbers) that can be generated from rolling a six-sided die twice? Please explain your reasoning.
Student: To determine the total number of two-digit numbers Nancy can generate by rolling a six-sided die twice, we need to consider the following:

1. **First Roll (Tens Digit)**: The first roll can result in any number from 1 to 6. This means there are 6 possible outcomes for the tens digit.
2. **Second Roll (Ones Digit)**: The second roll can also result in any number from 1 to 6, giving us another 6 possible outcomes for the ones digit.

To find the total number of two-digit numbers, we multiply the number of outcomes for the tens digit by the number of outcomes for the ones digit:

Total outcomes = (Number of outcomes for tens digit) × (Number of outcomes for ones digit)  
Total outcomes = 6 × 6 = 36

So, Nancy can generate a total of 36 different two-digit numbers. 

Is this reasoning correct? Should I move on to the next step?
Teacher: Your reasoning for determining the total number of outcomes is absolutely correct!

Now, let's move on to the next step. We need to identify which of these two-digit numbers (constructed from pairs of die rolls, with each digit between 1 and 6) are divisible by 8.

Can you list out the numbers among these 36 possibilities that are divisible by 8 and explain your process for checking divisibility by 8?
Student: Student: To find the two-digit numbers that are divisible by 8, we first need to understand that a number is divisible by 8 if the number formed by its last three digits is divisible by 8. In our case, since we are only dealing with two-digit numbers, we can check each number formed by the tens and ones digits.

The two-digit numbers Nancy can generate range from 11 to 66, with the first digit being the result of the first roll (1 to 6) and the second digit being the result of the second roll (1 to 6). 

Now, let's list out all the possible two-digit numbers:

- From 1 as the tens digit: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16
- From 2 as the tens digit: 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26
- From 3 as the tens digit: 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36
- From 4 as the tens digit: 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46
- From 5 as the tens digit: 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56
- From 6 as the tens digit: 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66

Next, I will check each of these numbers for divisibility by 8:

- **11**: Not divisible by 8
- **12**: Not divisible by 8
- **13**: Not divisible by 8
- **14**: Not divisible by 8
- **15**: Not divisible by 8
- **16**: Divisible by 8
- **21**: Not divisible by 8
- **22**: Not divisible by 8
- **23**: Not divisible by 8
- **24**: Divisible by 8
- **25**: Not divisible by 8
- **26**: Not divisible by 8
- **31**: Not divisible by 8
- **32**: Divisible by 8
- **33**: Not divisible by 8
- **34**: Not divisible by 8
- **35**: Not divisible by 8
- **36**: Not divisible by 8
- **41**: Not divisible by 8
- **42**: Not divisible by 8
- **43**: Not divisible by 8
- **44**: Not divisible by 8
- **45**: Not divisible by 8
- **46**: Not divisible by 8
- **51**: Not divisible by 8
- **52**: Not divisible by 8
- **53**: Not divisible by 8
- **54**: Not divisible by 8
- **55**: Not divisible by 8
- **56**: Divisible by 8
- **61**: Not divisible by 8
- **62**: Not divisible by 8
- **63**: Not divisible by 8
- **64**: Divisible by 8
- **65**: Not divisible by 8
- **66**: Not divisible by 8

From this list, the numbers that are divisible by 8 are: **16, 24, 32, 56, and 64**.

So, there are 5 favorable outcomes that are divisible by 8. 

Should I move on to the next step of counting the favorable outcomes and calculating the probability?
Teacher: Great work listing all the outcomes and identifying the ones divisible by 8! You correctly found that the favorable outcomes are 16, 24, 32, 56, and 64 (a total of 5 numbers).

Now, moving on to the next step: We need to calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.

Can you compute the probability of Nancy generating a two-digit number divisible by 8 (favorable outcomes over total outcomes), and explain if this fraction is in simplest form?
Student: Student: Sure! We have already determined the total number of outcomes, which is 36, and the number of favorable outcomes, which is 5. 

Now, we can calculate the probability:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of Favorable Outcomes}}{\text{Total Outcomes}} = \frac{5}{36}
\]

Next, we need to check if this fraction is in its simplest form. The numerator is 5 and the denominator is 36. Since 5 is a prime number and does not divide 36, there are no common factors between them other than 1. Therefore, the fraction \(\frac{5}{36}\) is already in simplest form.

So, the final probability that the resulting integer is divisible by 8 is:

\[
\frac{5}{36}
\]

Is there anything else I should consider or do next?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly figured out that there are 5 favorable outcomes (16, 24, 32, 56, and 64) out of 36 possible outcomes, and you confirmed that the probability is 5/36 in its simplest form.

To summarize: we first determined there are 36 total two‐digit numbers made from two die rolls. Then by checking divisibility by 8, we identified 5 numbers that meet the condition. Finally, we computed the probability as 5/36.

Your final answer is: 5/36$
