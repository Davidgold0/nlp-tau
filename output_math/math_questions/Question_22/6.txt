Question: Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $1.2n-4.4<5.2$.
3o-mini: We start with the inequality:

  1.2n - 4.4 < 5.2

Step 1: Add 4.4 to both sides to isolate the term containing n:
  1.2n < 5.2 + 4.4
  1.2n < 9.6

Step 2: Divide both sides by 1.2:
  n < 9.6 / 1.2
  n < 8

Since we are looking for positive integers, n can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

Step 3: Find the sum of these integers:
  Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7

We can use the formula for the sum of the first k positive integers, where k = 7:
  Sum = (7 × 8) / 2 = 28

Thus, the sum of all positive integers n for which the inequality holds is 28.
