Question: Sam decides to start a rumor. Sam tells the rumor to her three friends. Each of Sam's three friends then tells the rumor to three friends who have not heard the rumor. This continues for five total cycles. Sam telling her three friends was the first cycle. How many people, not including Sam, will have heard the rumor when the fifth cycle is complete?
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem. We have a rumor spreading in cycles:
• In the first cycle, Sam tells the rumor to 3 friends.
• Then, in every subsequent cycle, each person who just heard the rumor passes it on to 3 new people.
• This continues for a total of 5 cycles (with Sam telling her 3 friends in the first cycle).

A good approach is to notice that this forms a geometric sequence. Here’s a step-by-step outline:

1. Identify how many people hear the rumor in each cycle.
   • Cycle 1: Sam tells 3 people.
   • Cycle 2: Each of those 3 people tells 3 new people.
   • Continue this process until Cycle 5.
   
2. Write down the number of people for each cycle.

3. Sum these numbers to get the total count of people (remember: not including Sam).

4. Verify you understand what parts of the total count are needed for the answer.

Now, for the first step: Can you determine how many people hear the rumor in the first cycle? Please solve this step and share your reasoning.
Student: In the first cycle, Sam tells the rumor to 3 friends. So, the number of people who hear the rumor in the first cycle is simply 3. 

To summarize:

- **Cycle 1**: 3 people hear the rumor (Sam's 3 friends).

Is this correct? Would you like me to proceed to the next cycle?
Teacher: You're absolutely correct—the first cycle involves 3 people hearing the rumor. 

Now, let's move on to the second cycle. In the second cycle, each person from the previous cycle tells the rumor to 3 new friends. Can you calculate how many people hear the rumor in this cycle? Please share your reasoning for this step.
Student: Student: In the second cycle, each of the 3 friends from the first cycle tells the rumor to 3 new friends. 

So, we calculate it as follows:

- **Cycle 2**: 3 friends × 3 new friends each = 3 × 3 = 9 people hear the rumor.

To summarize:

- **Cycle 1**: 3 people hear the rumor.
- **Cycle 2**: 9 people hear the rumor.

Is this calculation correct? Should I proceed to the next cycle?
Teacher: Great job with cycle 2! Your calculation is correct—9 people hear the rumor in cycle 2. 

Now, let's move on to cycle 3. In cycle 3, each of the 9 people from cycle 2 will tell the rumor to 3 new friends. Can you figure out how many people will hear the rumor in this third cycle? Please explain your reasoning step by step.
Student: Student: In cycle 3, each of the 9 people from cycle 2 tells the rumor to 3 new friends. 

To calculate how many people hear the rumor in this cycle, we can use the following reasoning:

- **Cycle 3**: 9 people × 3 new friends each = 9 × 3 = 27 people hear the rumor.

To summarize:

- **Cycle 1**: 3 people hear the rumor.
- **Cycle 2**: 9 people hear the rumor.
- **Cycle 3**: 27 people hear the rumor.

Is this calculation correct? Should I move on to cycle 4?
Teacher: Your calculation for cycle 3 is exactly right—27 people hear the rumor. Well done!

Now, let's work on cycle 4. Remember, in cycle 4 every one of the 27 people from cycle 3 will tell the rumor to 3 new friends. Could you calculate how many people will hear the rumor in cycle 4? Please share your reasoning for this next step.
Student: Student: In cycle 4, each of the 27 people from cycle 3 will tell the rumor to 3 new friends. 

To find out how many people hear the rumor in this cycle, we can calculate it as follows:

- **Cycle 4**: 27 people × 3 new friends each = 27 × 3 = 81 people hear the rumor.

To summarize:

- **Cycle 1**: 3 people hear the rumor.
- **Cycle 2**: 9 people hear the rumor.
- **Cycle 3**: 27 people hear the rumor.
- **Cycle 4**: 81 people hear the rumor.

Is this calculation correct? Should I proceed to cycle 5?
Teacher: Excellent work on cycle 4! Now, let’s move on to cycle 5. Remember: in cycle 5, each of the 81 people from cycle 4 tells the rumor to 3 new friends. Could you please calculate how many people hear the rumor in cycle 5? Share your reasoning for this step.
Student: Student: In cycle 5, each of the 81 people from cycle 4 will tell the rumor to 3 new friends. 

To find out how many people hear the rumor in this cycle, we can calculate it as follows:

- **Cycle 5**: 81 people × 3 new friends each = 81 × 3 = 243 people hear the rumor.

To summarize:

- **Cycle 1**: 3 people hear the rumor.
- **Cycle 2**: 9 people hear the rumor.
- **Cycle 3**: 27 people hear the rumor.
- **Cycle 4**: 81 people hear the rumor.
- **Cycle 5**: 243 people hear the rumor.

Is this calculation correct? Would you like me to sum all the cycles to find the total number of people who have heard the rumor?
Teacher: Great work on cycle 5! Now we have the following numbers for each cycle:

• Cycle 1: 3 people  
• Cycle 2: 9 people  
• Cycle 3: 27 people  
• Cycle 4: 81 people  
• Cycle 5: 243 people  

The next step is to find the total number of people who have heard the rumor (not including Sam) by summing up these numbers. Can you please add these together and share your reasoning for finding the total?
Student: Student: To find the total number of people who have heard the rumor after all five cycles, I will sum the number of people from each cycle:

- **Cycle 1**: 3 people  
- **Cycle 2**: 9 people  
- **Cycle 3**: 27 people  
- **Cycle 4**: 81 people  
- **Cycle 5**: 243 people  

Now, let's add these numbers together step by step:

1. First, I’ll add Cycle 1 and Cycle 2:
   - 3 + 9 = 12

2. Next, I’ll add the result to Cycle 3:
   - 12 + 27 = 39

3. Then, I’ll add the result to Cycle 4:
   - 39 + 81 = 120

4. Finally, I’ll add the result to Cycle 5:
   - 120 + 243 = 363

So, the total number of people who have heard the rumor after five cycles is **363** (not including Sam).

To summarize:

- Total number of people who heard the rumor: **363**.

Is this the correct total?
Teacher: You've done a fantastic job working through each cycle. Let's quickly review your reasoning:

• In Cycle 1: 3 people heard the rumor.  
• In Cycle 2: 3 × 3 = 9 people.  
• In Cycle 3: 9 × 3 = 27 people.  
• In Cycle 4: 27 × 3 = 81 people.  
• In Cycle 5: 81 × 3 = 243 people.

Then, you summed these numbers:  
3 + 9 = 12  
12 + 27 = 39  
39 + 81 = 120  
120 + 243 = 363

Your final calculation is correct. The total number of people (not including Sam) who have heard the rumor after five cycles is:

363$
