Question: Sam decides to start a rumor. Sam tells the rumor to her three friends. Each of Sam's three friends then tells the rumor to three friends who have not heard the rumor. This continues for five total cycles. Sam telling her three friends was the first cycle. How many people, not including Sam, will have heard the rumor when the fifth cycle is complete?
3o-mini: This problem involves a geometric sequence. In the first cycle, Sam tells 3 friends. Each subsequent cycle, every person who has just heard the rumor tells it to 3 new friends.

Cycle 1: 3 people  
Cycle 2: 3 × 3 = 9 people  
Cycle 3: 9 × 3 = 27 people  
Cycle 4: 27 × 3 = 81 people  
Cycle 5: 81 × 3 = 243 people  

To find the total number of people (not including Sam), add the counts from each cycle:

Total = 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 = 363

Thus, when the fifth cycle is complete, 363 people will have heard the rumor.
