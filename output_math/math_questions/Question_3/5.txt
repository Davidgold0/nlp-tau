Question: The owners of a house that is assessed at $\$120,\!000$ pay $\$3,\!000$ in taxes. At the same rate, what is the tax, in dollars, for a house assessed at $\$160,\!000$?
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem. We know that a house assessed at $120,000 has a tax of $3,000. That allows us to find the tax rate by dividing the tax by the assessed value. 

Step 1: Find the tax rate.
What is 3000 divided by 120000? Please calculate that, and let me know your answer for the tax rate.
Student: To find the tax rate, I will divide the tax amount by the assessed value of the house.

So, I will calculate:

\[
\text{Tax Rate} = \frac{3000}{120000}
\]

Now, performing the division:

\[
\text{Tax Rate} = 0.025
\]

The tax rate is \(0.025\) or \(2.5\%\). 

Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Great job! Your calculation of the tax rate was correct: 3000 divided by 120000 gives a rate of 0.025 (or 2.5%).

Now, for the next step: We'll use this tax rate to calculate the tax for a house assessed at 160,000. What expression would you write for the tax on the 160,000 assessment, and what result do you get when you compute it? Please show your work for this multiplication step.
Student: To find the tax for a house assessed at $160,000 using the tax rate we calculated, I will use the following expression:

\[
\text{Tax} = \text{Tax Rate} \times \text{Assessed Value}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Tax} = 0.025 \times 160000
\]

Now, I will perform the multiplication:

\[
\text{Tax} = 0.025 \times 160000 = 4000
\]

So, the tax for a house assessed at $160,000 is $4,000. 

Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Great work! You correctly set up the multiplication by using the found tax rate, and your calculation of 0.025 × 160,000 = 4,000 is spot on.

To summarize our process:

1. We calculated the tax rate by dividing $3,000 by $120,000, arriving at 0.025 (or 2.5%).
2. Using this tax rate, we found the tax for the $160,000 assessment by computing 0.025 × 160,000, which equals 4,000.

Final answer: 4000$
