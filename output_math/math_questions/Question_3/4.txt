Question: The owners of a house that is assessed at $\$120,\!000$ pay $\$3,\!000$ in taxes. At the same rate, what is the tax, in dollars, for a house assessed at $\$160,\!000$?
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem into clear steps. 

The question tells us that a house assessed at $120,000 has taxes of $3,000, and we need to find out how much tax would be due for a house assessed at $160,000 at the same tax rate.

Here are the steps we might consider:

1. Determine the tax rate by comparing the tax amount to the assessed value for the first house.
2. Once we have the tax rate, apply it to the assessed value of the second house.
3. Calculate the tax for the second house using that rate.

Let's focus on the first step: Finding the tax rate. 

How would you determine the tax rate from the given information of a $120,000 house having $3,000 in taxes? Please work on just that step, and share your thoughts or calculations.
Student: To determine the tax rate from the information provided, I can use the formula for the tax rate, which is:

\[
\text{Tax Rate} = \frac{\text{Tax Amount}}{\text{Assessed Value}}
\]

In this case, the tax amount is $3,000 and the assessed value is $120,000. 

So, I would calculate the tax rate as follows:

\[
\text{Tax Rate} = \frac{3,000}{120,000}
\]

Now, let me compute that:

\[
\text{Tax Rate} = \frac{3,000}{120,000} = 0.025
\]

This means the tax rate is 0.025, or 2.5%. 

Is that the correct approach for finding the tax rate?
Teacher: Great work! You've correctly determined the tax rate as 0.025 (or 2.5%). Now, let's move to the next step:

Apply this tax rate to the second house, which is assessed at $160,000. How would you set up the calculation for finding the tax on the $160,000 house using the tax rate you calculated? Please share the setup or formula you would use.
Student: Student: To find the tax on the house assessed at $160,000 using the tax rate of 0.025, I can set up the calculation like this:

\[
\text{Tax} = \text{Tax Rate} \times \text{Assessed Value}
\]

In this case, the assessed value is $160,000, so I would substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Tax} = 0.025 \times 160,000
\]

Now, let me compute that:

\[
\text{Tax} = 0.025 \times 160,000 = 4,000
\]

So, the tax for the house assessed at $160,000 would be $4,000. Is that correct?
Teacher: Excellent work! Your reasoning is correct. To summarize what we've done:

1. We determined the tax rate by dividing the tax amount by the assessed value (3,000 รท 120,000 = 0.025 or 2.5%).
2. Then we applied that rate to the second house by multiplying the tax rate by its assessed value (0.025 ร 160,000).

Since you correctly set up and computed the calculation for the second house, your final answer is correct.

4000$
