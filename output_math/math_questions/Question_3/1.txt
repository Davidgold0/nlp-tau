Question: The owners of a house that is assessed at $\$120,\!000$ pay $\$3,\!000$ in taxes. At the same rate, what is the tax, in dollars, for a house assessed at $\$160,\!000$?
Teacher: Let's start by outlining the steps we need to take to solve the problem:

1. Restate the Problem:  
   We have a house assessed at $120,000 with taxes of $3,000. We need to find the tax rate first. Then, using that rate, we’ll calculate the tax for a house assessed at $160,000.

2. Determine the Tax Rate:  
   The tax rate can be found by dividing the amount of tax by the assessed value of the house.

3. Apply the Tax Rate to the New Assessment:  
   Multiply the tax rate by the new assessment value ($160,000) to get the tax owed.

Let's work through the first step together:  
Step 1: Calculate the tax rate using the given information.  
What calculation would you perform to find the tax rate? Please show your work for just this step.
Student: To find the tax rate, I will divide the amount of tax paid by the assessed value of the house. 

The calculation is as follows:

\[
\text{Tax Rate} = \frac{\text{Amount of Tax}}{\text{Assessed Value}} = \frac{3000}{120000}
\]

Now, I will perform the division:

\[
\text{Tax Rate} = \frac{3000}{120000} = 0.025
\]

So, the tax rate is 0.025, or 2.5%. 

Is this correct, teacher?
Teacher: You're on the right track! Your calculation of the tax rate is correct: 3000 ÷ 120000 = 0.025, which means a tax rate of 2.5%. 

Now let's move on to the next step: calculate the tax for a house assessed at $160,000 by using this tax rate.

What calculation will you perform next? Please show your work for just this step.
Student: To calculate the tax for a house assessed at $160,000 using the tax rate of 0.025 (or 2.5%), I will multiply the assessed value of the new house by the tax rate.

The calculation is as follows:

\[
\text{Tax} = \text{Assessed Value} \times \text{Tax Rate} = 160000 \times 0.025
\]

Now, I will perform the multiplication:

\[
\text{Tax} = 160000 \times 0.025 = 4000
\]

So, the tax for a house assessed at $160,000 is $4,000. 

Is this correct, teacher?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly determined the tax rate and then applied it to the new assessed value.

To summarize:
1. You calculated the tax rate as 3000 ÷ 120000 = 0.025 (or 2.5%).
2. Then you applied this rate to the $160,000 assessment: 160000 × 0.025 = 4000.

Your answer of $4,000 is correct.

4000$
