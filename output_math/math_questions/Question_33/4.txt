Question: William is taking the 25-question, multiple choice American Mathematics Competition. Each question has five answer choices. William guesses random answers for the last four questions. What is the probability that he will get at least one of these final four questions right?
Teacher: Let's break down the problem into clear steps. The question tells us that William is guessing randomly on the last four multiple choice questions (each with 5 choices). To find the probability that he gets at least one correct answer, we can follow these steps:

1. First, determine the probability that he gets a single question wrong.
2. Then, find the probability that he gets all four questions wrong.
3. Use the complement rule to calculate the probability of getting at least one correct answer—that is, subtract the probability of getting all four wrong from 1.

Let's start with the first step.

What is the probability that William gets one question wrong? Please show your work for this step, and we'll discuss your reasoning together.
Student: To find the probability that William gets one question wrong, we can start by looking at the number of answer choices available for each question. Since each question has 5 answer choices and only one of them is correct, the probability of getting a question wrong is the number of wrong choices divided by the total number of choices.

1. **Total choices**: 5
2. **Wrong choices**: 4 (since there is 1 correct answer)

Now, we can calculate the probability of getting one question wrong:

\[
P(\text{wrong}) = \frac{\text{number of wrong choices}}{\text{total choices}} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

So, the probability that William gets one question wrong is \(\frac{4}{5}\).

Does this make sense? What should we do next?
Teacher: Great job on finding the probability of getting one question wrong! 

Now, let's move on to the next step: finding the probability that William gets all four of the final questions wrong. 

Remember, because his guesses are independent, you'll need to multiply the probability of getting one question wrong (which is 4/5) by itself four times. 

What is the probability that he gets all four questions wrong? Please show your work for this step.
Student: Student: Thank you for the guidance! Since we have already determined that the probability of getting one question wrong is \(\frac{4}{5}\), we can find the probability of getting all four questions wrong by multiplying this probability by itself four times, since each guess is independent.

So, we calculate:

\[
P(\text{all four wrong}) = P(\text{wrong}) \times P(\text{wrong}) \times P(\text{wrong}) \times P(\text{wrong}) = \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^4
\]

Now, let's compute \(\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^4\):

\[
\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^4 = \frac{4^4}{5^4} = \frac{256}{625}
\]

Thus, the probability that William gets all four questions wrong is \(\frac{256}{625}\).

What should we do next?
Teacher: Great work on computing the probability that all four answers are wrong. Now, let's move on to the final step.

Step 3: Use the complement rule. The complement rule tells us that the probability of at least one success (in this case, getting at least one correct answer) is 1 minus the probability of no successes (getting all four wrong).

In other words, you need to calculate:  
Probability of at least one correct = 1 – Probability (all four wrong).

You already found that the probability of all four wrong is 256/625.

Could you please compute the probability of at least one correct answer by using the complement rule and show your work for this step?
Student: Sure! To find the probability that William gets at least one of the final four questions correct, we can use the complement rule as you mentioned.

We already found that the probability of getting all four questions wrong is:

\[
P(\text{all four wrong}) = \frac{256}{625}
\]

Now, we can use the complement rule:

\[
P(\text{at least one correct}) = 1 - P(\text{all four wrong})
\]

Substituting the value we found:

\[
P(\text{at least one correct}) = 1 - \frac{256}{625}
\]

To perform the subtraction, we need to express 1 in terms of the same denominator:

\[
1 = \frac{625}{625}
\]

Now we can subtract:

\[
P(\text{at least one correct}) = \frac{625}{625} - \frac{256}{625} = \frac{625 - 256}{625} = \frac{369}{625}
\]

Therefore, the probability that William gets at least one of the last four questions correct is:

\[
\frac{369}{625}
\]

Does this answer make sense? What do you think?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly computed the probability that William gets at least one of his four final questions correct.

To summarize our steps:  
1. We determined the probability of getting one question wrong is 4/5.  
2. We found the probability of getting all four questions wrong by raising 4/5 to the 4th power, which is 256/625.  
3. Finally, we used the complement rule to compute the probability of getting at least one correct as 1 – 256/625 = 369/625.

Your final answer is 369/625$
