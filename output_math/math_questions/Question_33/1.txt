Question: William is taking the 25-question, multiple choice American Mathematics Competition. Each question has five answer choices. William guesses random answers for the last four questions. What is the probability that he will get at least one of these final four questions right?
Teacher: Let's break down the problem together. The question asks: "What is the probability that William gets at least one of the final four questions right if he guesses randomly on each question (each with 5 choices)?" 

To tackle this, we can follow these steps:
1. Find the probability of getting a single question wrong.
2. Use that to determine the probability that William gets all four questions wrong.
3. Use the complement rule (1 minus the probability of all being wrong) to find the probability of getting at least one question right.

Let's start with the first step:

Step 1: What is the probability that William gets a single question wrong? Please show your work for this part.
Student: To find the probability that William gets a single question wrong, we first need to consider the number of choices he has for each question. Since there are 5 answer choices for each question, and only one of those choices is correct, the probability of guessing incorrectly can be calculated as follows:

1. The total number of choices = 5
2. The number of incorrect choices = 5 - 1 = 4

Now, the probability of getting a single question wrong is:

\[
P(\text{wrong}) = \frac{\text{Number of incorrect choices}}{\text{Total number of choices}} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

So, the probability that William gets a single question wrong is \(\frac{4}{5}\). 

Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Great job on the first step! You correctly found that the probability of getting a single question wrong is 4/5.

Now, let's move on to the next step:

Step 2: What is the probability that William gets all four of the final questions wrong? Please work through this step and share your calculation.
Student: Student: Thank you, Teacher! Now, to find the probability that William gets all four of the final questions wrong, we can use the probability we found in the first step.

Since the probability of getting a single question wrong is \(\frac{4}{5}\), and the questions are independent (the outcome of one question does not affect the others), we can multiply the probabilities for all four questions:

\[
P(\text{all four wrong}) = P(\text{wrong}) \times P(\text{wrong}) \times P(\text{wrong}) \times P(\text{wrong}) = \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^4
\]

Now, let's calculate \(\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^4\):

\[
\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^4 = \frac{4^4}{5^4} = \frac{256}{625}
\]

So, the probability that William gets all four questions wrong is \(\frac{256}{625}\).

Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Excellent work on the second step! You correctly computed that the probability that William gets all four questions wrong is 256/625.

Now, let's move on to the final step:

Step 3: What is the probability that William gets at least one of the final four questions right? Remember, you'll need to use the complement rule here. Please show your work for finding 1 minus the probability that he gets them all wrong.
Student: Student: Thank you, Teacher! Now, to find the probability that William gets at least one of the final four questions right, we will use the complement rule. This means we will subtract the probability of getting all four questions wrong from 1.

We already found that the probability of getting all four questions wrong is \(\frac{256}{625}\). 

So, we can calculate the probability of getting at least one question right as follows:

\[
P(\text{at least one right}) = 1 - P(\text{all four wrong}) = 1 - \frac{256}{625}
\]

Now, we need to perform the subtraction:

To subtract \(\frac{256}{625}\) from 1, we can express 1 as \(\frac{625}{625}\):

\[
P(\text{at least one right}) = \frac{625}{625} - \frac{256}{625} = \frac{625 - 256}{625} = \frac{369}{625}
\]

Thus, the probability that William gets at least one of the final four questions right is \(\frac{369}{625}\).

Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Great work on the final step! You correctly applied the complement rule and completed the subtraction to find the probability. Your calculation shows that the probability of getting at least one question right is 369/625.

If you're ready to finalize your answer, please provide your final answer exactly as required. Remember, your final answer should be written as a number followed immediately by a $.

What is your final answer?
Student: My final answer is \( \frac{369}{625} \) or 0.5904 when expressed as a decimal. So, the final answer is:

369/625$
Teacher: Excellent work throughout the process! You've correctly determined that the probability of William getting at least one of the final four questions right is found by using the complement rule, and your work shows that the final probability is 369/625. 

Your final answer is:
369/625$
