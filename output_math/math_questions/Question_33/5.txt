Question: William is taking the 25-question, multiple choice American Mathematics Competition. Each question has five answer choices. William guesses random answers for the last four questions. What is the probability that he will get at least one of these final four questions right?
Teacher: Let's break down the problem together. We want to find the probability that William gets at least one of the final four questions right when he guesses randomly. Here’s an outline of the steps we can follow:

1. Determine the probability that he gets a single question correct when guessing.
2. Determine the probability that he gets a single question wrong.
3. Use the complement rule: Calculate the probability that he gets all four questions wrong.
4. Subtract that probability from 1 to find the probability that he gets at least one question right.

Let’s start with the first step:

Step 1: What is the probability that William gets a single question right by guessing, given that there are 5 answer choices?

Please calculate this, and tell me your answer for the probability of guessing one question correctly.
Student: To find the probability that William gets a single question right by guessing, we can use the information that there are 5 answer choices for each question. Since only one of those choices is correct, the probability of guessing correctly is:

\[
P(\text{correct}) = \frac{1}{5}
\]

So, the probability that William gets a single question correct by guessing is \( \frac{1}{5} \) or 0.2. 

Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Great job! Your calculation is correct: the probability of guessing one question correctly is indeed 1/5. 

Now, let's move to the next step: What is the probability that William gets a single question wrong? Please calculate that probability and share your answer.
Student: To find the probability that William gets a single question wrong, we can use the fact that there are 5 answer choices and only one of them is correct. Therefore, the probability of guessing incorrectly is:

\[
P(\text{wrong}) = 1 - P(\text{correct}) = 1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

So, the probability that William gets a single question wrong by guessing is \( \frac{4}{5} \) or 0.8.

Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: That's right; the probability of getting one question wrong is 4/5.

Now, let's work on the next step: We need to find the probability that William gets all four of his final questions wrong. Using what you've already found (that each question is answered incorrectly with probability 4/5), how would you calculate the probability that he gets all four questions wrong? Please show your work for this step.
Student: To find the probability that William gets all four of his final questions wrong, we can use the probability of getting one question wrong, which we found to be \( \frac{4}{5} \).

Since the questions are independent (the outcome of one question does not affect the others), we can multiply the probability of getting a single question wrong by itself for all four questions. Therefore, we have:

\[
P(\text{all four wrong}) = P(\text{wrong})^4 = \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^4
\]

Now, let's calculate \( \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^4 \):

\[
\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^4 = \frac{4^4}{5^4} = \frac{256}{625}
\]

So, the probability that William gets all four questions wrong is \( \frac{256}{625} \).

Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Great work! You've correctly calculated the probability that William gets all four questions wrong as 256/625.

Now, for the final step, let’s find the probability that he gets at least one question right. Remember, we can use the complement rule: instead of calculating the probability of at least one right directly, we subtract the probability of getting all four wrong from 1.

Please calculate the probability that William gets at least one question right by using this idea. What result do you get when you compute 1 - (256/625)?
Student: To find the probability that William gets at least one question right, we will use the complement rule as you mentioned. We need to subtract the probability that he gets all four questions wrong from 1.

We already calculated that the probability of getting all four questions wrong is \( \frac{256}{625} \). Now we can compute:

\[
P(\text{at least one right}) = 1 - P(\text{all four wrong}) = 1 - \frac{256}{625}
\]

To perform the subtraction, we first convert 1 into a fraction with a denominator of 625:

\[
1 = \frac{625}{625}
\]

Now, we can subtract:

\[
P(\text{at least one right}) = \frac{625}{625} - \frac{256}{625} = \frac{625 - 256}{625} = \frac{369}{625}
\]

Therefore, the probability that William gets at least one question right is \( \frac{369}{625} \).

Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Excellent work! You correctly used the complement rule to find the probability that William gets at least one question right. Your process was spot on. The final answer is:

369/625$
