Question: The equation $x^2-6x+2=29$ has two solutions, $a$ and $b$, with $a\geq b$. What is the value of $2a-3b$?
Teacher: Let's begin by understanding the problem together. We’re given the equation

  x² – 6x + 2 = 29

and we need to find its two solutions (let’s call them a and b, with a ≥ b) and then compute the expression 2a – 3b.

A good first step is to rewrite the equation so that one side is zero. Can you tell me what the equation becomes after you subtract 29 from both sides?
Student: Sure! If we start with the equation \( x^2 - 6x + 2 = 29 \) and subtract 29 from both sides, we get:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 2 - 29 = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 6x - 27 = 0
\]

Is this correct?
Teacher: Great job! You correctly subtracted 29 from both sides to obtain x² - 6x - 27 = 0. For the next step, we need to solve this quadratic equation. One approach is to factor the quadratic expression if possible. Can you try to factor x² - 6x - 27? What pair of numbers would multiply to -27 and add up to -6?
Student: Student: To factor the expression \( x^2 - 6x - 27 \), we need to find two numbers that multiply to \(-27\) and add up to \(-6\). 

The pair of numbers that works is \( -9 \) and \( 3 \) because:

\[
-9 \times 3 = -27 \quad \text{and} \quad -9 + 3 = -6.
\]

So, we can factor the quadratic as:

\[
(x - 9)(x + 3) = 0.
\]

Is that correct?
Teacher: You're on the right track with factoring the quadratic expression! Now that you've factored it as (x – 9)(x + 3) = 0, the next step is to solve each equation separately to find the values of x. 

Can you set up the equations from these factors and solve for x? Please show your work for this step.
Student: Sure! From the factored form \((x - 9)(x + 3) = 0\), we can set each factor equal to zero:

1. \(x - 9 = 0\)
2. \(x + 3 = 0\)

Now, let's solve each equation:

1. For \(x - 9 = 0\):
   \[
   x = 9
   \]

2. For \(x + 3 = 0\):
   \[
   x = -3
   \]

So, the two solutions are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -3\). Since we defined \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a \geq b\), we have:

- \(a = 9\)
- \(b = -3\)

What should we do next?
Teacher: Great job finding the solutions and correctly identifying a = 9 and b = -3. Now that we have these values, the next step is to compute the expression 2a – 3b. 

Please substitute a = 9 and b = -3 into the expression and calculate 2a – 3b. What do you get?
Student: Sure! Let's substitute \( a = 9 \) and \( b = -3 \) into the expression \( 2a - 3b \):

\[
2a - 3b = 2(9) - 3(-3).
\]

Now, let's calculate each part:

1. Calculate \( 2(9) \):
   \[
   2(9) = 18.
   \]

2. Calculate \( -3(-3) \):
   \[
   -3(-3) = 9.
   \]

Now, putting it all together:

\[
2a - 3b = 18 + 9 = 27.
\]

So, the final value of \( 2a - 3b \) is \( 27 \).
