Question: The equation $x^2-6x+2=29$ has two solutions, $a$ and $b$, with $a\geq b$. What is the value of $2a-3b$?
Teacher: Let's begin by outlining the steps needed to solve the problem without jumping to the final answer.

Step 1: Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form by moving all terms to one side. That is, subtract 29 from both sides of the equation x² - 6x + 2 = 29.

Could you please perform this first step and show your work for rewriting the equation?
Student: Sure! To rewrite the equation \(x^2 - 6x + 2 = 29\) in standard quadratic form, I will subtract 29 from both sides.

Starting with the original equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 2 - 29 = 0
\]

Now, simplifying the left side:

\[
x^2 - 6x - 27 = 0
\]

So, the equation in standard quadratic form is:

\[
x^2 - 6x - 27 = 0
\]

Is this step correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Great job on rewriting the equation correctly into standard form! Now let's move on to the next step.

Step 2: Solve the quadratic equation x² - 6x - 27 = 0 by factoring it (if possible) to find its two solutions. Remember, we need to identify a and b such that a ≥ b.

Could you please attempt to factor the quadratic equation and find the values of x?
Student: Sure! To solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 6x - 27 = 0\) by factoring, I need to find two numbers that multiply to \(-27\) (the constant term) and add up to \(-6\) (the coefficient of the linear term).

After considering the factors of \(-27\), I find that the numbers \(-9\) and \(3\) work because:

\[
-9 \times 3 = -27 \quad \text{and} \quad -9 + 3 = -6
\]

Now, I can factor the quadratic equation as follows:

\[
(x - 9)(x + 3) = 0
\]

Next, I can set each factor equal to zero to find the solutions for \(x\):

1. \(x - 9 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 9\)
2. \(x + 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -3\)

So, the two solutions are \(a = 9\) and \(b = -3\) (with \(a \geq b\)). 

Is this correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Great job on factoring the quadratic and identifying the solutions a = 9 and b = -3!

Now, let's move on to Step 3: We need to calculate the value of 2a - 3b using these values. Could you please substitute a = 9 and b = -3 into the expression 2a - 3b and show your work?
Student: Sure! To calculate the value of \(2a - 3b\) using the values \(a = 9\) and \(b = -3\), I will substitute these values into the expression.

Starting with the expression:

\[
2a - 3b
\]

Substituting \(a = 9\) and \(b = -3\):

\[
2(9) - 3(-3)
\]

Now, calculating each term:

\[
2(9) = 18
\]

And for the second term:

\[
-3(-3) = 9
\]

Now, combining these results:

\[
18 + 9 = 27
\]

So, the value of \(2a - 3b\) is:

\[
\boxed{27}
\]

Is this correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Excellent work! Your process was accurate. You first rewrote the equation to standard form, then correctly factored the quadratic and identified the solutions a = 9 and b = –3. Finally, you accurately substituted these values into the expression 2a–3b and simplified to obtain 27.

Now, please confirm your final answer by stating it, followed immediately by a $ with nothing else after it.
Student: The final answer is \(27\) $
Teacher: Your final answer is correct.
