Question: The equation $x^2-6x+2=29$ has two solutions, $a$ and $b$, with $a\geq b$. What is the value of $2a-3b$?
Teacher: Let's start by outlining the steps to solve the problem:

1. Rephrase the equation: Write the equation x² - 6x + 2 = 29 in standard form (set equal to zero).
2. Solve the quadratic equation: You can either factor it (if it factors nicely) or use the quadratic formula to find the two solutions, naming them a and b (with a ≥ b).
3. Compute the expression: Once you have a and b, substitute them in the expression 2a - 3b to get the final value.

Now, please begin with the first step: Rewrite the equation in standard form by moving all terms to one side (i.e., subtract 29 from both sides). What equation do you get?
Student: To rewrite the equation \( x^2 - 6x + 2 = 29 \) in standard form, I will subtract 29 from both sides. 

Starting with the original equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 2 - 29 = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 6x - 27 = 0
\]

So the equation in standard form is \( x^2 - 6x - 27 = 0 \). 

What should I do next?
Teacher: Great job rewriting the equation in standard form! Now, let's move to the next step: solving the quadratic equation x² - 6x - 27 = 0. 

To solve it, one method is to factor the quadratic. Do you think you can find two numbers that multiply to -27 and add up to -6, which might allow you to factor the equation? Give that a try—focus on finding those two numbers.
Student: To factor the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 6x - 27 = 0 \), I need to find two numbers that multiply to \(-27\) (the constant term) and add up to \(-6\) (the coefficient of \(x\)).

The numbers that meet these conditions are \(-9\) and \(3\), because:

- \(-9 \times 3 = -27\)
- \(-9 + 3 = -6\)

Using these numbers, I can factor the equation as follows:

\[
(x - 9)(x + 3) = 0
\]

Now, I can set each factor equal to zero to find the solutions:

1. \(x - 9 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 9\)
2. \(x + 3 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -3\)

So the solutions are \(a = 9\) and \(b = -3\) (with \(a \geq b\)). 

What should I do next?
Teacher: Excellent work factoring the quadratic and finding a = 9 and b = -3. Now, let's move on to the next step: computing the value of 2a - 3b. 

Since you have a and b, please substitute these values into the expression 2a - 3b and simplify step-by-step. What result do you obtain?
Student: To compute the value of \(2a - 3b\) using the values \(a = 9\) and \(b = -3\), I will substitute these values into the expression:

\[
2a - 3b = 2(9) - 3(-3)
\]

Now, I will calculate each part:

1. Calculate \(2(9)\):
\[
2(9) = 18
\]

2. Calculate \(-3(-3)\):
\[
-3(-3) = 9
\]

Now, I can combine these results:

\[
2a - 3b = 18 + 9 = 27
\]

Thus, the value of \(2a - 3b\) is \(27\). 

Is there anything else you would like me to consider?
Teacher: Great work on finding the values a = 9 and b = -3 and using them to compute 2a - 3b. To summarize:

• You rewrote the equation as x² – 6x – 27 = 0.
• You factored the quadratic into (x – 9)(x + 3) = 0 to find the solutions a = 9 and b = -3.
• You substituted these into 2a – 3b to get 2(9) – 3(–3) = 18 + 9 = 27.

The final answer is 27$
