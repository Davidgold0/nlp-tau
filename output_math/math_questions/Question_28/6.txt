Question: Find the minimum value of_x000D_
\[\frac{\left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^6 - \left( x^6 + \dfrac{1}{x^6} \right) - 2}{\left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^3 + \left( x^3 + \dfrac{1}{x^3} \right)}\]for $x > 0.$
3o-mini: We wish to minimize

  E = [ (x + 1/x)⁶ – (x⁶ + 1/x⁶) – 2 ] / [ (x + 1/x)³ + (x³ + 1/x³) ]          for x > 0.

Step 1. Express in Terms of a New Variable

Let

  y = x + 1/x.

It is known (by the standard identities) that
  x³ + 1/x³ = y³ – 3y.

Step 2. Simplify the Numerator

The numerator is
  N = (x + 1/x)⁶ – (x⁶ + 1/x⁶) – 2 = y⁶ – (x⁶ + 1/x⁶) – 2.

Notice that
  (x³ + 1/x³)² = x⁶ + 1/x⁶ + 2       (since (a)² = a² + 2ab + b² with a = x³, b =1/x³).
This implies
  x⁶ + 1/x⁶ = (x³ + 1/x³)² – 2.

Substitute into N:
  N = y⁶ – [(x³ + 1/x³)² – 2] – 2 = y⁶ – (x³ + 1/x³)².

Step 3. Factor the Numerator

Observe that
  y⁶ – (x³ + 1/x³)² = (y³)² – (x³ + 1/x³)² = (y³ – (x³ + 1/x³))·(y³ + (x³ + 1/x³)).

Step 4. Cancel with the Denominator

The denominator is
  D = (x + 1/x)³ + (x³ + 1/x³) = y³ + (x³ + 1/x³).

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
  E = { (y³ – (x³+1/x³))·(y³ + (x³+1/x³)) } / [ y³ + (x³+1/x³) ] = y³ – (x³+1/x³).

Step 5. Substitute Back Using the Identity

Recall:
  x³ + 1/x³ = y³ – 3y.
Therefore,
  E = y³ – (y³ – 3y) = 3y = 3(x + 1/x).

Step 6. Find the Minimum Value

The problem now is to minimize 3(x + 1/x) for x > 0. By the AM–GM inequality,
  x + 1/x ≥ 2,
with equality when x = 1. Hence,
  3(x + 1/x) ≥ 3·2 = 6,
and the minimum value is attained when x = 1.

Answer: The minimum value of the given expression is 6.
