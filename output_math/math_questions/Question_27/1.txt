Question: A class of 25 students includes the Smith quadruplets.  The teacher must select two students from the class to represent the class in the school's student government.  Instead of holding an election, the teacher decides to choose the two representatives at random.  What is the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets?
Teacher: Let's start by outlining the process to solve the problem:

1. Determine the total number of ways to choose any 2 students from the 25.  
2. Determine the number of ways to choose 2 students from just the Smith quadruplets.  
3. Write the probability as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (step 2) to the total outcomes (step 1).

Now, please start with the first step: finding the total number of ways to choose 2 students from the 25. What expression or value do you get for that?
Student: To find the total number of ways to choose 2 students from the 25, we can use the combination formula, which is given by:

\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

In this case, \( n = 25 \) (the total number of students) and \( r = 2 \) (the number of students we want to choose). 

So, we calculate:

\[
\binom{25}{2} = \frac{25!}{2!(25-2)!} = \frac{25!}{2! \cdot 23!}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\binom{25}{2} = \frac{25 \times 24}{2 \times 1} = \frac{600}{2} = 300
\]

Therefore, there are 300 ways to choose 2 students from the 25. 

Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Your work on finding the total number of ways to choose 2 students from 25 is correctâ€”it indeed comes out to 300. Great job!

Now, moving on to the next step: Please determine how many ways there are to choose 2 students from the 4 Smith quadruplets. Please use the combination formula as before. What expression or value do you get for that?
Student: Student: Thank you, Teacher! Now, to find the number of ways to choose 2 students from the 4 Smith quadruplets, I will use the combination formula again.

Here, \( n = 4 \) (the number of Smith quadruplets) and \( r = 2 \) (the number of students we want to choose). 

So, we calculate:

\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4!}{2! \cdot 2!}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
\]

Therefore, there are 6 ways to choose 2 students from the 4 Smith quadruplets. 

Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Excellent work! Your calculation for choosing 2 Smith quadruplets is spot on with 6 ways.

Now, let's move on to the next step: We need to determine the probability that both chosen representatives are Smith quadruplets. To do this, you'll form a ratio where the number of favorable outcomes is 6 (from choosing 2 of the quadruplets) and the total number of outcomes is 300 (from choosing any 2 students among 25).

Please calculate this probability by setting up the ratio 6/300 and simplifying it. What result do you get?
Student: Student: Thank you, Teacher! To calculate the probability that both chosen representatives are Smith quadruplets, I will set up the ratio as you mentioned:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{6}{300}
\]

Now, let's simplify this fraction:

\[
\frac{6}{300} = \frac{1}{50}
\]

So, the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets is \(\frac{1}{50}\).

Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Excellent work! You correctly determined that after choosing 2 students at random from 25 (300 ways) and noting that 2 Smith quadruplets can be chosen in 6 ways, the probability is set up as 6/300, which simplifies to 1/50.

To summarize our approach:
1. Compute total ways: 25C2 = 300.
2. Compute favorable ways: 4C2 = 6.
3. Form and simplify the probability: 6/300 = 1/50.

Your reasoning is spot on.
