Question: A class of 25 students includes the Smith quadruplets.  The teacher must select two students from the class to represent the class in the school's student government.  Instead of holding an election, the teacher decides to choose the two representatives at random.  What is the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets?
3o-mini: There are 25 students in total and 4 Smith quadruplets.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 students from 25.  
This is given by the combination formula: C(25, 2) = 25 × 24 / 2 = 300.

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 Smith quadruplets from the 4.  
This is given by: C(4, 2) = 4 × 3 / 2 = 6.

Step 3: Determine the probability that both chosen representatives are Smith quadruplets.  
Probability = (Favorable outcomes) / (Total outcomes) = 6 / 300 = 1 / 50.

Thus, the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets is 1/50.
