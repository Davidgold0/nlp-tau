Question: A class of 25 students includes the Smith quadruplets.  The teacher must select two students from the class to represent the class in the school's student government.  Instead of holding an election, the teacher decides to choose the two representatives at random.  What is the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets?
3o-mini: To find the probability that both representatives are Smith quadruplets, we first determine the total number of ways to choose 2 students from the class and then determine the number of favorable ways to choose 2 students from the Smith quadruplets.

Total number of ways to choose 2 students from 25 = 25C2 = (25 × 24)/2 = 300.

Number of ways to choose 2 Smith quadruplets = 4C2 = (4 × 3)/2 = 6.

The probability that both representatives are Smith quadruplets is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:

Probability = 6 / 300 = 1/50.

Thus, the probability is 1/50.
