Question: In triangle $ABC$, $\tan \angle CAB = \frac{22}{7}$, and the altitude from $A$ divides $\overline{BC}$ into segments of length $3$ and $17$. What is the area of triangle $ABC$?
Teacher: Let's start by outlining the approach to this problem. We are given a triangle ABC with an altitude from A to side BC. This altitude splits BC into segments of lengths 3 and 17. Also, we know that tan(∠A) = 22/7. One way to tackle the problem is as follows:

1. Draw triangle ABC and drop the altitude from A to BC (label the foot of the altitude as D). Then note that BD = 3 and DC = 17.
2. Recognize that triangles ABD and ADC are right triangles (with right angles at D). In each of these right triangles, you can express the angle at A as follows:
  • In triangle ABD, tan(angle BAD) = (altitude h) / 3.
  • In triangle ADC, tan(angle CAD) = (altitude h) / 17.
3. Notice that ∠A in triangle ABC is the sum of angles BAD and CAD. Using the tangent addition formula:
  tan(∠A) = [tan(angle BAD) + tan(angle CAD)] / [1 − tan(angle BAD)·tan(angle CAD)].
4. Substitute h/3 for tan(angle BAD) and h/17 for tan(angle CAD) into the formula and set that equal to 22/7.
5. Solve the equation for h (the altitude).
6. Once h is found, compute the area of triangle ABC using the formula:
  Area = ½ * (base BC) * h,
  noting that BC = 3 + 17.

Let’s begin with the first step: setting up the expression for tan(∠A) using the sum of the angles from the two right triangles. Can you write the equation using the tangent addition formula with tan(angle BAD) = h/3 and tan(angle CAD) = h/17?
Student: Sure! Let's start by applying the tangent addition formula to express \(\tan(\angle A)\) in terms of \(h\).

We know that:
- \(\tan(\angle BAD) = \frac{h}{3}\)
- \(\tan(\angle CAD) = \frac{h}{17}\)

Using the tangent addition formula, we have:

\[
\tan(\angle A) = \tan(\angle BAD + \angle CAD) = \frac{\tan(\angle BAD) + \tan(\angle CAD)}{1 - \tan(\angle BAD) \cdot \tan(\angle CAD)}
\]

Substituting the expressions we have for \(\tan(\angle BAD)\) and \(\tan(\angle CAD)\):

\[
\tan(\angle A) = \frac{\frac{h}{3} + \frac{h}{17}}{1 - \left(\frac{h}{3} \cdot \frac{h}{17}\right)}
\]

Now, let's simplify the numerator and the denominator.

**Numerator:**
\[
\frac{h}{3} + \frac{h}{17} = h \left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{17}\right) = h \left(\frac{17 + 3}{51}\right) = h \left(\frac{20}{51}\right)
\]

**Denominator:**
\[
1 - \left(\frac{h^2}{51}\right) = \frac{51 - h^2}{51}
\]

Putting it all together, we get:

\[
\tan(\angle A) = \frac{h \left(\frac{20}{51}\right)}{\frac{51 - h^2}{51}} = \frac{20h}{51 - h^2}
\]

Now, we know from the problem statement that \(\tan(\angle A) = \frac{22}{7}\). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{20h}{51 - h^2} = \frac{22}{7}
\]

Would you like me to proceed with solving this equation for \(h\)?
Teacher: Excellent work! Your derivation of the equation

  (20h)⁄(51 - h²) = 22⁄7

is exactly right. Now, let's move to the next step without jumping to the final answer.

Step 2: Solve the equation (20h)⁄(51 - h²) = 22⁄7 for the altitude h.

How would you approach solving this equation? Please write down the first steps (like cross-multiplying) to isolate h.
Student: Sure! To solve the equation 

\[
\frac{20h}{51 - h^2} = \frac{22}{7},
\]

we can start by cross-multiplying to eliminate the fractions. This gives us:

\[
20h \cdot 7 = 22 \cdot (51 - h^2).
\]

Now, let's simplify both sides:

\[
140h = 22(51 - h^2).
\]

Next, we can distribute \(22\) on the right side:

\[
140h = 1122 - 22h^2.
\]

Now, let's rearrange the equation to bring all terms to one side:

\[
22h^2 + 140h - 1122 = 0.
\]

This is a quadratic equation in standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) where \(a = 22\), \(b = 140\), and \(c = -1122\).

Would you like me to proceed with solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, or do you have a different method in mind?
Teacher: Great job! Your derivation of the quadratic equation

  22h² + 140h − 1122 = 0

is correct. Now, let's move on step by step.

Step 3: Solve this quadratic equation for h. The first step is to apply the quadratic formula:

  h = [−b ± √(b² − 4ac)]⁄(2a)

Here, a = 22, b = 140, and c = −1122.

Can you calculate the discriminant (b² − 4ac) and simplify it before we move further?
Student: Sure! To calculate the discriminant \(b^2 - 4ac\) for the quadratic equation \(22h^2 + 140h - 1122 = 0\), we will use the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

- \(a = 22\)
- \(b = 140\)
- \(c = -1122\)

Now, let's calculate \(b^2\) and \(4ac\):

1. Calculate \(b^2\):
\[
b^2 = 140^2 = 19600
\]

2. Calculate \(4ac\):
\[
4ac = 4 \cdot 22 \cdot (-1122) = -4 \cdot 22 \cdot 1122 = -99264
\]

Now, we can find the discriminant:
\[
b^2 - 4ac = 19600 - (-99264) = 19600 + 99264 = 118864
\]

So, the discriminant is \(118864\). 

Would you like me to proceed with calculating the value of \(h\) using the quadratic formula now?
Teacher: You've made a good start, but let's re-check the multiplication in the discriminant calculation carefully. We need to compute the discriminant using

  b² – 4ac

with a = 22, b = 140, and c = –1122.

1. Compute b²:
  140² = 19600.

2. Compute 4ac:
  4 × 22 × (–1122). First, calculate 22 × 1122. Can you re-calculate 22 × 1122 step-by-step? Once you have that, multiply by 4 (and then note the sign).
Student: Sure! Let's break down the calculation of \(22 \times 1122\) step-by-step.

1. First, we can multiply \(22\) by \(1122\):
   \[
   22 \times 1122 = 22 \times (1000 + 100 + 20 + 2)
   \]
   \[
   = 22 \times 1000 + 22 \times 100 + 22 \times 20 + 22 \times 2
   \]
   \[
   = 22000 + 2200 + 440 + 44
   \]
   \[
   = 22000 + 2200 = 24200
   \]
   \[
   = 24200 + 440 = 24640
   \]
   \[
   = 24640 + 44 = 24684
   \]

So, \(22 \times 1122 = 24684\).

2. Now, we multiply by \(4\):
   \[
   4 \times 24684 = 98736
   \]

Since \(c\) is negative, we have:
\[
4ac = -98736
\]

Now, let's calculate the discriminant:
\[
b^2 - 4ac = 19600 - (-98736) = 19600 + 98736 = 118336
\]

So the corrected discriminant is \(118336\). 

Would you like me to proceed with calculating \(h\) using the quadratic formula now?
Teacher: That's a very good correction! Now that you have the discriminant calculated as 118336, let's move forward.

Step 4: Use the quadratic formula for h:
  h = [–b ± √(b² – 4ac)]⁄(2a)

Recall:
 a = 22, b = 140, c = –1122,
and the discriminant is 118336.

Please write the expression for h using these values, and then simplify as much as possible. Remember to consider only the positive value for h since it represents a length.

What do you get for h?
Student: Sure! Let's apply the quadratic formula:

\[
h = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

- \(a = 22\)
- \(b = 140\)
- \(c = -1122\)
- Discriminant \(b^2 - 4ac = 118336\)

Now, we can plug these into the formula:

\[
h = \frac{-140 \pm \sqrt{118336}}{2 \cdot 22}
\]

First, we need to calculate \(\sqrt{118336}\):

\[
\sqrt{118336} = 344
\]

Now, substituting this back into the equation for \(h\):

\[
h = \frac{-140 \pm 344}{44}
\]

Now, we will calculate the two possible values for \(h\):

1. **Using the positive root**:
\[
h = \frac{-140 + 344}{44} = \frac{204}{44} = \frac{51}{11} \approx 4.6364
\]

2. **Using the negative root**:
\[
h = \frac{-140 - 344}{44} = \frac{-484}{44} \approx -11
\]

Since \(h\) represents a length, we discard the negative value. Thus, we have:

\[
h = \frac{51}{11}
\]

Now that we have found \(h\), would you like me to proceed to calculate the area of triangle \(ABC\) using the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times h,
\]

where the base \(BC = 3 + 17\)?
Teacher: Great work obtaining h = 51/11. Now let's move on to the final step.

Step 5: Calculate the area of triangle ABC using the formula

  Area = ½ × base × altitude.

Since the altitude h = 51/11 and the base BC = 3 + 17 = 20, please set up and simplify the expression for the area.

What expression do you get for the area?
Student: To calculate the area of triangle \(ABC\), we use the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times h.
\]

We have determined:
- The base \(BC = 3 + 17 = 20\).
- The altitude \(h = \frac{51}{11}\).

Now, substituting these values into the area formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 \times \frac{51}{11}.
\]

First, let's calculate \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 \):

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10.
\]

Now, we can substitute this back into the area expression:

\[
\text{Area} = 10 \times \frac{51}{11} = \frac{510}{11}.
\]

Thus, the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{510}{11}.
\]

Would you like me to provide the approximate decimal value or is this sufficient?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've successfully reached the final answer. To summarize, we used the tangent addition formula in the two right triangles to set up an equation in h, solved the quadratic after carefully calculating the discriminant, and then used the altitude to compute the triangle's area. Your calculations showed that h = 51/11 and the area is

  Area = ½ × (3 + 17) × (51/11) = 510/11

510/11$
