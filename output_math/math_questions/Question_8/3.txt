Question: In triangle $ABC$, $\tan \angle CAB = \frac{22}{7}$, and the altitude from $A$ divides $\overline{BC}$ into segments of length $3$ and $17$. What is the area of triangle $ABC$?
Teacher: Let’s begin by breaking the problem into steps. We have triangle ABC with altitude from A landing at point D on BC, and BC is divided into segments of lengths 3 and 17 (so BC = 3 + 17 = 20). We’re given tan(∠CAB) = 22/7. Notice that the altitude AD creates two right triangles: ABD and ADC.

Step 1: Let the altitude AD = h. Then, in triangle ABD (with BD = 3) you have tan(∠BAD) = h/3, and in triangle ADC (with DC = 17) you have tan(∠CAD) = h/17. Since ∠CAB is the sum ∠BAD + ∠CAD, using the tangent addition formula you can express tan(∠CAB) in terms of h.

Using the tangent addition formula:
  tan(∠BAD + ∠CAD) = (tan(∠BAD) + tan(∠CAD)) / [1 – tan(∠BAD)·tan(∠CAD)]

Now, rephrase this step in your own words and set up the expression for tan(∠CAB) in terms of h. What expression do you get?
Student: Sure! Let's break down the steps based on your guidance.

We have triangle \( ABC \) with the altitude \( AD \) from point \( A \) to side \( BC \), which divides \( BC \) into segments \( BD = 3 \) and \( DC = 17 \), making the total length of \( BC \) equal to \( 20 \).

We are given that \( \tan \angle CAB = \frac{22}{7} \). 

In triangle \( ABD \), we can express \( \tan \angle BAD \) as:
\[
\tan \angle BAD = \frac{h}{3}
\]
where \( h \) is the length of the altitude \( AD \).

In triangle \( ADC \), we can express \( \tan \angle CAD \) as:
\[
\tan \angle CAD = \frac{h}{17}
\]

Now, since \( \angle CAB = \angle BAD + \angle CAD \), we can use the tangent addition formula:
\[
\tan(\angle BAD + \angle CAD) = \frac{\tan \angle BAD + \tan \angle CAD}{1 - \tan \angle BAD \cdot \tan \angle CAD}
\]

Substituting the expressions we have:
\[
\tan \angle CAB = \frac{\frac{h}{3} + \frac{h}{17}}{1 - \left(\frac{h}{3}\right)\left(\frac{h}{17}\right)}
\]

Now, let's combine the terms in the numerator:
\[
\tan \angle CAB = \frac{\frac{17h + 3h}{51}}{1 - \frac{h^2}{51}} = \frac{\frac{20h}{51}}{1 - \frac{h^2}{51}}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\tan \angle CAB = \frac{20h}{51 - h^2}
\]

Now we can set this equal to the given value of \( \tan \angle CAB \):
\[
\frac{20h}{51 - h^2} = \frac{22}{7}
\]

This sets us up to solve for \( h \). Would you like me to continue solving for \( h \) from here?
Teacher: Great work rephrasing the problem and setting up the tangent addition formula! Now, we have the equation

  (20h) / (51 – h²) = 22/7

Your next step is to solve this equation for h. To make progress:

1. Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions.
2. Rearrange the resulting equation to form a quadratic in h.
3. Prepare to solve the quadratic equation.

Could you please perform the cross-multiplication and simplify the equation as the next step?
Student: Sure! Let's cross-multiply the equation:

\[
\frac{20h}{51 - h^2} = \frac{22}{7}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives us:

\[
20h \cdot 7 = 22 \cdot (51 - h^2)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
140h = 22(51 - h^2)
\]

Now, distributing on the right side:

\[
140h = 1122 - 22h^2
\]

Next, let's rearrange this equation to form a quadratic equation:

\[
22h^2 + 140h - 1122 = 0
\]

Now we have the quadratic equation in standard form. Would you like me to proceed with solving this quadratic equation for \( h \)?
Teacher: Great work! You've correctly arrived at the quadratic equation:

  22h² + 140h – 1122 = 0

Now, our next step is to solve this quadratic equation for h. Since h represents the altitude, we’re interested only in the positive solution. You can use the quadratic formula to find h. Could you please calculate the value of h using the quadratic formula?
Student: Sure! To solve the quadratic equation \( 22h^2 + 140h - 1122 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula, we use the formula:

\[
h = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In our equation, \( a = 22 \), \( b = 140 \), and \( c = -1122 \).

First, let's calculate the discriminant \( b^2 - 4ac \):

\[
b^2 = 140^2 = 19600
\]
\[
4ac = 4 \cdot 22 \cdot (-1122) = -98832
\]
\[
b^2 - 4ac = 19600 + 98832 = 118432
\]

Now we can substitute \( a \), \( b \), and the discriminant back into the quadratic formula:

\[
h = \frac{-140 \pm \sqrt{118432}}{2 \cdot 22}
\]

Calculating \( \sqrt{118432} \):

\[
\sqrt{118432} \approx 344.16
\]

Now substituting this value back into the formula for \( h \):

\[
h = \frac{-140 \pm 344.16}{44}
\]

Calculating the two potential solutions:

1. For the positive root:
\[
h = \frac{-140 + 344.16}{44} \approx \frac{204.16}{44} \approx 4.64
\]

2. For the negative root:
\[
h = \frac{-140 - 344.16}{44} \approx \frac{-484.16}{44} \approx -11
\]

Since \( h \) must be positive, we take:

\[
h \approx 4.64
\]

Now that we have the height \( h \), would you like me to proceed to find the area of triangle \( ABC \) using this height?
Teacher: Great job computing h! Now that we have h (which we determined to be h = 51/11 exactly, or approximately 4.6364), the next step is to find the area of triangle ABC.

Recall that the area of a triangle is given by the formula:
  Area = ½ × (base) × (height)

In our triangle, the base is BC, which we calculated to be 20, and the height is h from A to BC.

Could you please set up and simplify the expression to find the area of the triangle using these values? Please solve just this next step.
Student: Sure! To find the area of triangle \( ABC \), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

In our case, the base \( BC \) is \( 20 \) and the height \( h \) is approximately \( 4.64 \) or exactly \( \frac{51}{11} \).

Substituting these values into the area formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 \times h
\]

Now plugging in the exact value for \( h \):

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 \times \frac{51}{11}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Calculate \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \).
2. Now multiply by \( \frac{51}{11} \):

\[
\text{Area} = 10 \times \frac{51}{11} = \frac{510}{11}
\]

Thus, the area of triangle \( ABC \) is:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{510}{11} \approx 46.36
\]

This gives us the final area of triangle \( ABC \). Would you like any further clarification or assistance with this result?
Teacher: Fantastic work! You've set up and simplified the expression correctly to find the area of triangle ABC. To recap, you found that the area is given by

  Area = ½ × 20 × (51/11) = (510/11).

Since we are only interested in the positive solution here, the final area of triangle ABC is

  510/11$

Great job on arriving at the final answer!
Student: Thank you! I'm glad I was able to work through the problem step by step. To summarize, we found that the area of triangle \( ABC \) is 

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{510}{11}.
\]

If there's anything else you'd like me to review or if you have more questions, feel free to ask!
Teacher: Excellent work! You've clearly explained your reasoning and arrived at the correct answer. To summarize our discussion:

• We began by noting that the altitude from A, which we called h, divided side BC into segments of 3 and 17.
• With tan(∠CAB) = 22/7 and using the tangent addition formula, you formed the equation (20h)/(51 – h²) = 22/7.
• After cross-multiplying and rearranging, you obtained the quadratic 22h² + 140h – 1122 = 0.
• Using the quadratic formula and choosing the positive solution, you found h = 51/11.
• Finally, you computed the area of triangle ABC as ½ × 20 × (51/11) = 510/11.

The final answer is 

510/11$
