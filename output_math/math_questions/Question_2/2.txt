Question: Factor $t^2-121$.
Teacher: Let's start by outlining the process needed to factor the expression.

Step 1: Recognize that the given expression t² - 121 is a difference of two terms, and check if each term is a perfect square.

Step 2: Identify each perfect square. In this case, determine what quantity t² represents and what number, when squared, gives 121.

Step 3: Once you've identified the squares, recall the difference of two squares formula: a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b). Determine what a and b should be in your case.

For now, please work on Step 1 by explaining why t² - 121 fits the pattern of a difference of two squares and identify what the two square terms are.
Student: In Step 1, I recognize that the expression \( t^2 - 121 \) fits the pattern of a difference of two squares because it can be expressed as the subtraction of two perfect squares. 

The first term, \( t^2 \), is the square of \( t \) since \( t^2 = (t)^2 \). 

The second term, \( 121 \), is a perfect square because it can be expressed as \( 11^2 \) since \( 11 \times 11 = 121 \).

So, the two square terms are:
- \( a = t \) (since \( t^2 = (t)^2 \))
- \( b = 11 \) (since \( 121 = (11)^2 \))

Thus, we have \( t^2 - 121 = (t)^2 - (11)^2 \), confirming that it is indeed a difference of two squares. 

Now, I’m ready to move on to the next step when you are!
Teacher: Great work! You clearly explained why t² - 121 is a difference of two perfect squares and correctly identified t² as (t)² and 121 as (11)².

Now, please move on to the next step. Using the difference of two squares formula, a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b), with a = t and b = 11, factor the expression t² - 121. What factorization do you obtain?
Student: In Step 2, using the difference of two squares formula \( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \), I can substitute the values we identified:

- \( a = t \)
- \( b = 11 \)

Now, applying the formula:

\[
t^2 - 121 = (t - 11)(t + 11)
\]

So, the factorization of \( t^2 - 121 \) is \( (t - 11)(t + 11) \).

If you have any further instructions or need me to check anything else, please let me know!
Teacher: Great job on successfully factoring the expression! You've correctly applied the difference of two squares formula and demonstrated that  

t² - 121 = (t - 11)(t + 11)

To summarize our process:
1. We recognized that t² and 121 are both perfect squares.
2. We identified t² as (t)² and 121 as (11)².
3. We applied the formula a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b) with a = t and b = 11.
4. We obtained the factorization (t - 11)(t + 11).

Final Answer: (t - 11)(t + 11)$
