Question: Find all values of $k$ so that_x000D_
\[x^2 - (k - 3) x - k + 6 > 0\]for all $x.$
Teacher: Let's begin by outlining our approach to this problem. We want to find all the values of k for which

  x² - (k - 3)x - k + 6 > 0  (for all x).

Since this is a quadratic expression in x and its leading coefficient (the coefficient of x²) is positive (1), we know a necessary and sufficient condition for the quadratic to be positive for all x is that its discriminant is less than zero.

Step 1: Determine the condition on the discriminant of the quadratic for it to be positive for all x.

Could you please explain what condition on the discriminant must hold for the quadratic to be positive for all x, and why is that the case?
Student: Sure! For a quadratic expression of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c \) to be positive for all values of \( x \), the discriminant must be less than zero. The discriminant \( D \) of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c \) is given by the formula:

\[
D = b^2 - 4ac
\]

In our case, the quadratic expression is:

\[
x^2 - (k - 3)x - (k - 6)
\]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -(k - 3) \), and \( c = -k + 6 \). 

To ensure that the quadratic is positive for all \( x \), we need to set up the condition for the discriminant:

\[
D < 0
\]

Now, let's calculate the discriminant for our quadratic:

\[
D = (-(k - 3))^2 - 4(1)(-k + 6)
\]
\[
D = (k - 3)^2 + 4(k - 6)
\]

Next, we simplify this expression. 

Can you help me with simplifying \( D \) and then setting up the inequality \( D < 0 \)?
Teacher: Good work outlining the discriminant condition. Let's break down the next step:

Step 2: Simplify the expression you got for D. You wrote

  D = (k - 3)² + 4(k - 6).

Could you please expand (k - 3)², add 4(k - 6) to it, and then write down the resulting expression for D? After that, set up the inequality D < 0. What do you get?
Student: Sure! Let's start by expanding the expression for \( D \):

1. **Expand \( (k - 3)^2 \)**:
   \[
   (k - 3)^2 = k^2 - 6k + 9
   \]

2. **Expand \( 4(k - 6) \)**:
   \[
   4(k - 6) = 4k - 24
   \]

3. **Combine these two results to find \( D \)**:
   \[
   D = (k^2 - 6k + 9) + (4k - 24)
   \]
   \[
   D = k^2 - 6k + 4k + 9 - 24
   \]
   \[
   D = k^2 - 2k - 15
   \]

Now we have the expression for the discriminant:
\[
D = k^2 - 2k - 15
\]

Next, we need to set up the inequality \( D < 0 \):
\[
k^2 - 2k - 15 < 0
\]

Shall we proceed to find the values of \( k \) that satisfy this inequality?
Teacher: Great job expanding the expression and setting up the inequality. Now for Step 3, we need to solve the inequality

  k² - 2k - 15 < 0.

A common approach is to first find the roots of the equation k² - 2k - 15 = 0, and then determine the interval(s) where the quadratic expression is negative. Could you please find the solutions (roots) of k² - 2k - 15 = 0?
Student: Sure! To find the roots of the equation \( k^2 - 2k - 15 = 0 \), we can use the quadratic formula:

\[
k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{D}}{2a}
\]

where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = -15 \). 

First, we calculate the discriminant \( D \):

\[
D = b^2 - 4ac = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(-15) = 4 + 60 = 64
\]

Now, we can find the roots using the quadratic formula:

\[
k = \frac{-(-2) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2(1)} = \frac{2 \pm 8}{2}
\]

Calculating the two possible values for \( k \):

1. \( k = \frac{2 + 8}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \)
2. \( k = \frac{2 - 8}{2} = \frac{-6}{2} = -3 \)

So, the roots of the equation \( k^2 - 2k - 15 = 0 \) are \( k = 5 \) and \( k = -3 \).

Next, we will analyze the intervals determined by these roots to find where \( k^2 - 2k - 15 < 0 \). The intervals to check are \( (-\infty, -3) \), \( (-3, 5) \), and \( (5, \infty) \).

Shall I proceed to test these intervals to see where the quadratic expression is negative?
Teacher: Great work finding the roots correctly! Now, let's proceed with Step 4.

We have the inequality:

  k² - 2k - 15 < 0

with roots k = -3 and k = 5. These roots divide the number line into three intervals: (-∞, -3), (-3, 5), and (5, ∞).

Could you please pick one test point in each interval and substitute it into the quadratic expression to determine the sign (positive or negative) of the expression in that interval? Let's start with the interval (-∞, -3). What test point would you choose, and what is the sign of the expression there?
Student: Student: For the interval \((-∞, -3)\), a suitable test point could be \(k = -4\). 

Now, let's substitute \(k = -4\) into the quadratic expression \(k^2 - 2k - 15\):

\[
D = (-4)^2 - 2(-4) - 15
\]
\[
D = 16 + 8 - 15
\]
\[
D = 9
\]

Since \(D = 9\) is positive, the expression \(k^2 - 2k - 15\) is positive in the interval \((-∞, -3)\).

Now, let's move on to the interval \((-3, 5)\). A good test point could be \(k = 0\). 

Shall I substitute \(k = 0\) into the quadratic expression to check the sign in this interval?
Teacher: Excellent idea to move on to the next interval. Yes, please go ahead and substitute k = 0 into the expression k² - 2k - 15. Once you do that, let me know what result you get and whether the expression is positive or negative in the interval (-3, 5).
Student: Sure! Let's substitute \( k = 0 \) into the quadratic expression \( k^2 - 2k - 15 \):

\[
D = (0)^2 - 2(0) - 15
\]
\[
D = 0 - 0 - 15
\]
\[
D = -15
\]

Since \( D = -15 \) is negative, the expression \( k^2 - 2k - 15 \) is negative in the interval \((-3, 5)\).

Now, let's check the last interval, \( (5, \infty) \). A suitable test point could be \( k = 6 \). Should I go ahead and substitute \( k = 6 \) into the expression to determine the sign in this interval?
Teacher: Great! Please substitute k = 6 into the expression k² - 2k - 15 and let me know what result you get. What is the sign of the expression in the interval (5, ∞)?
Student: Sure! Let's substitute \( k = 6 \) into the quadratic expression \( k^2 - 2k - 15 \):

\[
D = (6)^2 - 2(6) - 15
\]
\[
D = 36 - 12 - 15
\]
\[
D = 36 - 27
\]
\[
D = 9
\]

Since \( D = 9 \) is positive, the expression \( k^2 - 2k - 15 \) is positive in the interval \( (5, \infty) \).

Now, we have the results for all three intervals:

1. In the interval \( (-\infty, -3) \), the expression is positive.
2. In the interval \( (-3, 5) \), the expression is negative.
3. In the interval \( (5, \infty) \), the expression is positive.

Since we want the expression \( k^2 - 2k - 15 < 0 \) to hold, the solution is the interval where the expression is negative:

\[
k \in (-3, 5)
\]

Thus, the values of \( k \) for which the original quadratic expression \( x^2 - (k - 3)x - k + 6 > 0 \) for all \( x \) are:

\[
\boxed{(-3, 5)}
\]
Teacher: Great work! Let's summarize our process:

1. We recognized that for a quadratic to be positive for all x, its discriminant must be less than 0.
2. We computed the discriminant for the quadratic x² - (k - 3)x - k + 6 and obtained D = k² - 2k - 15.
3. Setting the inequality k² - 2k - 15 < 0, we solved for k by finding its roots, which were k = -3 and k = 5.
4. Testing intervals determined by those roots, we found that the expression is negative in the interval (-3, 5).

So, the values of k for which the original quadratic is positive for all x are:

(-3, 5)$
