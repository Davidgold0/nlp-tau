Question: Simplify the following expression:   \[2x+3x^2+1-(6-2x-3x^2).\]
Teacher: Let's start by rephrasing the problem in our own words:

We need to simplify the expression:
  2x + 3x² + 1 – (6 – 2x – 3x²).

A good way to begin is by expanding the parentheses—that is, applying the negative sign to every term inside the parentheses. 

Can you tell me what you get when you distribute the negative sign across the terms in (6 – 2x – 3x²)? Please show just that step.
Student: Sure! When we distribute the negative sign across the terms in the parentheses \( (6 - 2x - 3x^2) \), we change the signs of each term inside. 

So, we have:

\[
-(6) + 2x + 3x^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-6 + 2x + 3x^2
\]

Now, we can rewrite the original expression with this distribution applied. Would you like me to continue from here?
Teacher: That's excellent work in distributing the minus sign! Now that we have rewritten the expression as

  2x + 3x² + 1 − 6 + 2x + 3x²,

the next step is to combine like terms. Could you please show me how you would combine the constant terms, the x terms, and the x² terms? Let's work on that step together.
Student: Sure! Now that we have the expression:

\[
2x + 3x² + 1 - 6 + 2x + 3x²,
\]

we can combine the like terms.

1. **Combine the constant terms**:
   - We have \(1\) and \(-6\), which gives us:
   \[
   1 - 6 = -5.
   \]

2. **Combine the x terms**:
   - We have \(2x\) and \(2x\), which gives us:
   \[
   2x + 2x = 4x.
   \]

3. **Combine the x² terms**:
   - We have \(3x²\) and \(3x²\), which gives us:
   \[
   3x² + 3x² = 6x².
   \]

Putting it all together, we have:

\[
6x² + 4x - 5.
\]

Is this the correct way to combine the terms? Would you like me to proceed with anything else?
Teacher: Great job combining the like terms! You've correctly identified that the constant terms (1 and -6) combine to -5, the x terms (2x and 2x) combine to 4x, and the x² terms (3x² and 3x²) combine to 6x².

So, you've simplified the expression to:
  6x² + 4x - 5

This is the final simplified form of the original expression. If you're ready, state your final answer by writing it out exactly, then end your answer with a $ immediately afterward.
Student: The final simplified form of the expression is:

\[ 6x² + 4x - 5 \]

$
Teacher: Excellent work! Your final simplified expression is 6x² + 4x - 5$.
