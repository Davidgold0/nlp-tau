Question: Simplify the following expression:   \[2x+3x^2+1-(6-2x-3x^2).\]
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem. We need to simplify the following expression:

  2x + 3x² + 1 – (6 – 2x – 3x²).

One way to approach this is to follow these steps:

1. Rewrite the expression without the parentheses by distributing the negative sign.
2. Combine like terms (that is, group the terms with x², the terms with x, and the constant terms).
3. Simplify the result as far as possible.

Let's focus on the first step: removing the parentheses by distributing the negative sign. Can you show me how you would rewrite the expression after distributing the negative sign?
Student: Sure! To rewrite the expression \(2x + 3x^2 + 1 - (6 - 2x - 3x^2)\), we need to distribute the negative sign across the terms inside the parentheses.

When we distribute the negative sign, we change the signs of each term inside the parentheses:

- The \(6\) becomes \(-6\),
- The \(-2x\) becomes \(+2x\),
- The \(-3x^2\) becomes \(+3x^2\).

So, the expression becomes:

\[2x + 3x^2 + 1 - 6 + 2x + 3x^2.\]

Now, we can move on to the next step, which is combining like terms. Would you like me to do that?
Teacher: Good work on distributing the negative sign! Now, let's move on to the next step, which is combining like terms.

We have the following expression after removing the parentheses:

  2x + 3x² + 1 – 6 + 2x + 3x²

To combine like terms, group the terms with x², the terms with x, and the constant terms separately.

Can you show me how you would combine these like terms step by step? What result do you get for each group?
Student: Student: Sure! Let's group the like terms from the expression \(2x + 3x^2 + 1 - 6 + 2x + 3x^2\).

1. **Terms with \(x^2\)**: We have \(3x^2\) and another \(3x^2\).
   - \(3x^2 + 3x^2 = 6x^2\)

2. **Terms with \(x\)**: We have \(2x\) and another \(2x\).
   - \(2x + 2x = 4x\)

3. **Constant terms**: We have \(1\) and \(-6\).
   - \(1 - 6 = -5\)

Now, putting it all together, we have:

\[6x^2 + 4x - 5.\]

So, the simplified expression is \(6x^2 + 4x - 5\). Would you like me to go over anything else?
Teacher: Great job on combining the like terms correctly! I see you’ve identified that:

• The x² terms combine to 3x² + 3x² = 6x².  
• The x terms combine to 2x + 2x = 4x.  
• And the constant terms combine to 1 – 6 = -5.

So putting it all together, the simplified expression is 6x² + 4x - 5.

Now, as our final answer, please state it followed immediately by a $ with nothing after it.
Student: The simplified expression is \(6x^2 + 4x - 5\)$.
Teacher: Excellent work! Your final answer is correct. Let's now state the final answer exactly as required:

6x^2 + 4x - 5$
