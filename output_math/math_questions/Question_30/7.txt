Question: What is the sum of all the positive divisors of 91?
3o-mini: To find the sum of all positive divisors of 91, first factor the number:

91 = 7 Ã— 13

Since both 7 and 13 are prime, the divisors of 91 are:
1, 7, 13, and 91.

Now, add these divisors:

1 + 7 + 13 + 91 = 112

Thus, the sum of all the positive divisors of 91 is 112.
