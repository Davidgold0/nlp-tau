Question: What is the sum of all the positive divisors of 91?
Teacher: Great! Let's work on this problem step by step.

The question is: "What is the sum of all the positive divisors of 91?" 

To break this down, here are the steps we need to follow:

1. First, find the prime factorization of 91.
2. Based on the prime factors, list all the positive divisors.
3. Finally, add those divisors to get the sum.

Let's start with the first step: Factorize 91 into its prime factors.

Could you please tell me what the prime factorization of 91 is?
Student: To find the prime factorization of 91, we can start by checking for divisibility by the smallest prime numbers.

1. 91 is not even, so it’s not divisible by 2.
2. Next, we check 3 by adding the digits (9 + 1 = 10), which is not divisible by 3.
3. Then, we check 5, but since 91 does not end in 0 or 5, it's not divisible by 5.
4. Now, we check 7: 91 divided by 7 equals 13, so 91 is divisible by 7.

Thus, the prime factorization of 91 is \(7 \times 13\).

Would you like me to proceed to the next step and list all the positive divisors of 91?
Teacher: Great job on finding the prime factors! Your reasoning is clear and correct. Now, let’s move on to the next step.

Based on your factorization, 91 = 7 × 13, please list all the positive divisors of 91 by considering all possible products of these prime factors (including 1 and the number itself).

What are the divisors of 91?
Student: To list all the positive divisors of 91 based on its prime factorization \(7 \times 13\), we can consider all combinations of these factors, including 1 and 91 itself. 

The positive divisors of 91 are:

1. \(1\) (the multiplicative identity)
2. \(7\) (one of the prime factors)
3. \(13\) (the other prime factor)
4. \(91\) (the product of the prime factors)

So, the complete list of positive divisors of 91 is: \(1, 7, 13, 91\).

Shall I move on to the final step and calculate the sum of these divisors?
Teacher: Excellent work listing all the positive divisors of 91 as 1, 7, 13, and 91. Now, let's move on to the final step: adding up these divisors to find the sum.

Could you please calculate the sum of 1, 7, 13, and 91? Let me know what you get for the final sum.
Student: Student: Sure! To find the sum of the positive divisors of 91, I'll add them together:

\[
1 + 7 + 13 + 91
\]

Calculating this step by step:

1. \(1 + 7 = 8\)
2. \(8 + 13 = 21\)
3. \(21 + 91 = 112\)

So, the sum of all the positive divisors of 91 is \(112\).
Teacher: Excellent work! Your reasoning is sound: you found the prime factorization to be 7 × 13, correctly listed the divisors as 1, 7, 13, and 91, and added them together to obtain 112.
