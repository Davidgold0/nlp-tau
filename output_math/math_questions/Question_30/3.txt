Question: What is the sum of all the positive divisors of 91?
Teacher: Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

Step 1: Factorize 91 into its prime factors.

First, rephrase the question in our own words: We need to find the sum of all positive divisors of 91. To do that, it's best to start by finding which prime numbers multiply together to give 91.

Now, please determine the prime factors of 91. What is the prime factorization of 91?
Student: To find the prime factorization of 91, I will look for prime numbers that can multiply together to equal 91. 

First, I can check if 91 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 91 is odd, it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, I will check 3. The sum of the digits in 91 (9 + 1 = 10) is not divisible by 3, so 91 is also not divisible by 3.

Now, I will try 5. Since 91 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Next, I will check 7. When I divide 91 by 7, I get 13 (since 7 x 13 = 91). Both 7 and 13 are prime numbers.

So, the prime factorization of 91 is \(7 \times 13\). 

Is that correct?
Teacher: Great job! Your prime factorization of 91 as 7 × 13 is absolutely correct. Now, let's move on to the next step.

Step 2: Use the prime factors to compute the sum of all the positive divisors of 91. Remember, for a number n with prime factorization p₁^a × p₂^b, the sum of its divisors is obtained by calculating (1 + p₁ + p₁² + ... + p₁^a) × (1 + p₂ + p₂² + ... + p₂^b).

Given that each prime factor in 91 (7 and 13) appears only once, can you determine the sum for each prime factor and then compute the final sum? Please share your calculations for this step.
Student: To find the sum of all positive divisors of 91 using its prime factorization \(7^1 \times 13^1\), I will follow the formula provided by you.

1. For the prime factor 7, since it appears once (\(a = 1\)), the sum of its divisors is:
   \[
   1 + 7 = 8
   \]

2. For the prime factor 13, which also appears once (\(b = 1\)), the sum of its divisors is:
   \[
   1 + 13 = 14
   \]

Now, I will multiply these sums together to find the total sum of the divisors of 91:
\[
8 \times 14 = 112
\]

So, the sum of all positive divisors of 91 is \(112\). 

Is this calculation correct?
Teacher: Excellent work! Your calculations are correct. You started by factoring 91 as 7 × 13, then you correctly used the formula for the sum of divisors:

• For 7: 1 + 7 = 8  
• For 13: 1 + 13 = 14  
• Multiplying these gives 8 × 14 = 112

You've put everything together perfectly.
