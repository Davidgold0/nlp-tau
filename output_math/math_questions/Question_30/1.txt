Question: What is the sum of all the positive divisors of 91?
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the question: we need to find the sum of all positive divisors of 91. A good first step is to determine the prime factorization of 91.

What do you think the prime factors of 91 are? Please share your process for finding them.
Student: To find the prime factorization of 91, I can start by checking for divisibility by the smallest prime numbers.

1. **Divisibility by 2**: 91 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
2. **Divisibility by 3**: The sum of the digits (9 + 1 = 10) is not divisible by 3, so 91 is not divisible by 3.
3. **Divisibility by 5**: 91 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
4. **Divisibility by 7**: I can divide 91 by 7. When I do this, \(91 ÷ 7 = 13\), which is a whole number.

Since both 7 and 13 are prime numbers, the prime factorization of 91 is \(7 \times 13\).

Does that sound correct, teacher?
Teacher: Excellent work! You're absolutely right—the prime factorization of 91 is 7 × 13. 

Now, let's move on to the next step. Based on the prime factorization, we need to identify all the positive divisors of 91. 

What divisors do you get from the factors 7 and 13, and can you list them along with a brief explanation of how you determine each one?
Student: Student: Thank you, teacher! To find all the positive divisors of 91 from its prime factorization \(7 \times 13\), I can use the fact that the divisors can be obtained by multiplying the factors in different combinations, including 1 and the number itself.

Here are the divisors I found:

1. **1**: This is always a divisor of any number.
2. **7**: This is one of the prime factors.
3. **13**: This is the other prime factor.
4. **91**: This is the product of the two prime factors \(7 \times 13\).

So, the complete list of positive divisors of 91 is: **1, 7, 13, and 91**. 

Does that look good, teacher?
Teacher: Great job listing the divisors: 1, 7, 13, and 91 are indeed all the positive divisors of 91.

Now, let's move to the next step. We need to find the sum of these divisors. What is the sum when you add 1, 7, 13, and 91 together? Please share your calculation for this step.
Student: Thank you, teacher! To find the sum of the positive divisors of 91, I will add together the numbers I listed: 1, 7, 13, and 91.

Here’s the calculation step-by-step:

1. Start with 1 + 7 = 8
2. Then add 13: 8 + 13 = 21
3. Finally, add 91: 21 + 91 = 112

So, the sum of all the positive divisors of 91 is **112**. 

Does that answer look correct, teacher?
Teacher: Great work! Let's review your process:

1. You found the prime factorization of 91 correctly as 7 × 13.
2. You then listed all its positive divisors: 1, 7, 13, and 91.
3. Finally, you summed these divisors: 1 + 7 + 13 + 91 = 112.

Your approach and calculations are correct. The final answer is 112$
