Question: Let \[P(x) = (2x^4 - 26x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c)(5x^4 - 80x^3 + dx^2 + ex + f),\]where $a, b, c, d, e, f$ are real numbers. Suppose that the set of all complex roots of $P(x)$ is $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}.$ Find $P(6).$
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the structure of the problem. We have

 P(x) = (2x⁴ – 26x³ + ax² + bx + c)(5x⁴ – 80x³ + dx² + ex + f).

This product gives us an eighth‐degree polynomial. We are told that its set of complex roots is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. This means the polynomial factors as

 P(x) = 10 · (x – 1)^(m₁) (x – 2)^(m₂) (x – 3)^(m₃) (x – 4)^(m₄) (x – 5)^(m₅),

where the total multiplicities satisfy
 m₁ + m₂ + m₃ + m₄ + m₅ = 8.

A good first step is to relate what you know from the given expanded factors with this factorization. For instance, the coefficient of x⁷ in the expansion carries useful information. In the general factorization above, the coefficient of x⁷ comes from summing (–m_i) times 10, that is:
 Coefficient of x⁷ = –10 · (m₁ + m₂ + m₃ + m₄ + m₅).

On the other hand, we can compute the coefficient of x⁷ by multiplying the two quartic factors. 

Please take a moment and determine what the coefficient of x⁷ is when we multiply the two given factors. How would you express that coefficient using the information provided in the factors? (Solve this step only.)
Student: To find the coefficient of \(x^7\) when multiplying the two quartic factors \(P(x) = (2x^4 - 26x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c)(5x^4 - 80x^3 + dx^2 + ex + f)\), we need to focus on the terms that contribute to \(x^7\) when we expand this product.

The coefficient of \(x^7\) comes from the following combinations of terms from both factors:

1. The \(x^4\) term from the first polynomial and the \(x^3\) term from the second polynomial.
2. The \(x^3\) term from the first polynomial and the \(x^4\) term from the second polynomial.

Calculating these contributions:

1. From \(2x^4\) and \(-80x^3\):
   \[
   2 \cdot (-80) = -160
   \]

2. From \(-26x^3\) and \(5x^4\):
   \[
   -26 \cdot 5 = -130
   \]

Now, we add these contributions together to find the total coefficient of \(x^7\):
\[
-160 + (-130) = -290
\]

So, the coefficient of \(x^7\) in the expansion of \(P(x)\) is \(-290\). 

Is there anything else you would like me to do with this information?
Teacher: Great work! Your calculation for the x⁷ coefficient is correct. You correctly identified that the only contributions come from:

 • 2x⁴ · (–80x³) = –160x⁷  
 • (–26x³) · 5x⁴ = –130x⁷

Adding these gives –160 – 130 = –290.

Now, recall that we also expressed P(x) in its factored form as  
 P(x) = 10 · (x – 1)^(m₁)(x – 2)^(m₂)(x – 3)^(m₃)(x – 4)^(m₄)(x – 5)^(m₅)  
with m₁ + m₂ + m₃ + m₄ + m₅ = 8.

Using Vieta’s formulas, the coefficient of x⁷ in this factored form is obtained by summing the contributions from each factor. In other words, it is  
 –10 · (m₁·1 + m₂·2 + m₃·3 + m₄·4 + m₅·5).

Please express the relationship by equating this term to the –290 you computed. Solve just this step: What equation relating the multiplicities m₁, m₂, m₃, m₄, and m₅ does this give you?
Student: To relate the coefficient of \(x^7\) from the factored form of \(P(x)\) to the coefficient we computed, we can set up the following equation:

From the factored form, we have:

\[
\text{Coefficient of } x^7 = -10 \cdot (m_1 \cdot 1 + m_2 \cdot 2 + m_3 \cdot 3 + m_4 \cdot 4 + m_5 \cdot 5).
\]

We previously calculated that the coefficient of \(x^7\) from the expanded form is \(-290\). Therefore, we can equate these two expressions:

\[
-10 \cdot (m_1 + 2m_2 + 3m_3 + 4m_4 + 5m_5) = -290.
\]

Dividing both sides by \(-10\) gives us:

\[
m_1 + 2m_2 + 3m_3 + 4m_4 + 5m_5 = 29.
\]

This is the equation relating the multiplicities \(m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5\). 

Is there anything else you would like me to do with this equation?
Teacher: Great job on setting up the equation. Now, here’s what we need to do next:

We know two things about the multiplicities m₁, m₂, m₃, m₄, and m₅ corresponding to the roots 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively:
 1. m₁ + m₂ + m₃ + m₄ + m₅ = 8          (since the total degree is 8)
 2. m₁ + 2m₂ + 3m₃ + 4m₄ + 5m₅ = 29       (from the x⁷ coefficient comparison)

A good strategy here is to notice that each multiplicity must be at least 1 (since all these numbers are roots). This leads you to write mᵢ = 1 + rᵢ, where each rᵢ is a nonnegative integer.

Once you substitute into the two equations, you can use the condition on the total multiplicities to find the sum of the rᵢ’s, and then determine possible values that satisfy the weighted sum equation.

For the next step, please express mᵢ as 1 + rᵢ and rewrite both equations accordingly. Can you do that and show how you get the equations for the rᵢ’s?
Student: Sure! Let's express each multiplicity \(m_i\) in terms of a new variable \(r_i\) such that:

\[
m_i = 1 + r_i \quad \text{for } i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
\]

where each \(r_i\) is a nonnegative integer (i.e., \(r_i \geq 0\)).

Now we can rewrite the first equation, which is the total multiplicity:

\[
m_1 + m_2 + m_3 + m_4 + m_5 = 8.
\]

Substituting \(m_i\) gives us:

\[
(1 + r_1) + (1 + r_2) + (1 + r_3) + (1 + r_4) + (1 + r_5) = 8.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
5 + (r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 + r_5) = 8.
\]

Subtracting 5 from both sides, we have:

\[
r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 + r_5 = 3. \quad \text{(1)}
\]

Next, we rewrite the second equation, which is related to the coefficient of \(x^7\):

\[
m_1 + 2m_2 + 3m_3 + 4m_4 + 5m_5 = 29.
\]

Substituting \(m_i\) gives us:

\[
(1 + r_1) + 2(1 + r_2) + 3(1 + r_3) + 4(1 + r_4) + 5(1 + r_5) = 29.
\]

This expands to:

\[
1 + r_1 + 2 + 2r_2 + 3 + 3r_3 + 4 + 4r_4 + 5 + 5r_5 = 29.
\]

Combining the constant terms, we have:

\[
15 + (r_1 + 2r_2 + 3r_3 + 4r_4 + 5r_5) = 29.
\]

Subtracting 15 from both sides gives:

\[
r_1 + 2r_2 + 3r_3 + 4r_4 + 5r_5 = 14. \quad \text{(2)}
\]

Now we have two equations:

1. \(r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 + r_5 = 3\)
2. \(r_1 + 2r_2 + 3r_3 + 4r_4 + 5r_5 = 14\)

What would you like me to do next with these equations?
Teacher: You're doing great! Now that we have our two equations in the rᵢ’s:

 (1) r₁ + r₂ + r₃ + r₄ + r₅ = 3  
 (2) r₁ + 2r₂ + 3r₃ + 4r₄ + 5r₅ = 14

remember, each rᵢ is a nonnegative integer.

Think about the possibilities: since the sum of all the rᵢ’s is only 3, you only have a few “units” to distribute. It might help to consider which rᵢ should receive more weight since the weighted sum (equation (2)) is 14, which is relatively high compared to 3. 

For your next step, please try to propose a set of values for r₁, r₂, r₃, r₄, and r₅ that satisfy both equations. For example, consider starting with the variable that has the highest coefficient (r₅ with coefficient 5) and see what value might work for it. What candidate values do you suggest? 

Please show your reasoning and attempt only this part.
Student: To find suitable values for \(r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4,\) and \(r_5\) that satisfy both equations, I will start by considering the weights in the second equation, particularly focusing on \(r_5\) since it has the highest coefficient of 5.

Given that the sum of \(r_i\) is only 3, it makes sense to assign the maximum possible value to \(r_5\) to help reach the total of 14 in the second equation.

Let's consider \(r_5 = 2\):
- If \(r_5 = 2\), then from equation (1):
  \[
  r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 + 2 = 3 \implies r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 = 1.
  \]
  
This means we have only one "unit" left to distribute among \(r_1, r_2, r_3,\) and \(r_4\). The simplest distribution is to set \(r_4 = 1\) and \(r_1 = r_2 = r_3 = 0\):
- So, we can propose:
  \[
  r_1 = 0, \quad r_2 = 0, \quad r_3 = 0, \quad r_4 = 1, \quad r_5 = 2.
  \]

Now, let's verify if these values satisfy both equations:
1. For equation (1):
   \[
   r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 + r_5 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 3.
   \]
   This holds true.

2. For equation (2):
   \[
   r_1 + 2r_2 + 3r_3 + 4r_4 + 5r_5 = 0 + 2(0) + 3(0) + 4(1) + 5(2) = 4 + 10 = 14.
   \]
   This also holds true.

Thus, the proposed values \(r_1 = 0\), \(r_2 = 0\), \(r_3 = 0\), \(r_4 = 1\), and \(r_5 = 2\) satisfy both equations.

Now, substituting back to find the multiplicities:
- \(m_1 = 1 + r_1 = 1 + 0 = 1\)
- \(m_2 = 1 + r_2 = 1 + 0 = 1\)
- \(m_3 = 1 + r_3 = 1 + 0 = 1\)
- \(m_4 = 1 + r_4 = 1 + 1 = 2\)
- \(m_5 = 1 + r_5 = 1 + 2 = 3\)

So the multiplicities are:
\[
m_1 = 1, \quad m_2 = 1, \quad m_3 = 1, \quad m_4 = 2, \quad m_5 = 3.
\]

What would you like me to do next with these values?
Teacher: Great work on finding the multiplicities! Now we know that

 P(x) = 10 · (x – 1)¹ · (x – 2)¹ · (x – 3)¹ · (x – 4)² · (x – 5)³.

The next step is to determine P(6). To do this, plug in x = 6 into the factored form.

That means you need to compute:
 P(6) = 10 · (6 – 1) · (6 – 2) · (6 – 3) · (6 – 4)² · (6 – 5)³.

Please calculate each factor step by step:
1. Compute (6 – 1), (6 – 2), (6 – 3), (6 – 4), and (6 – 5).
2. Then apply the appropriate powers (remember the exponents on (6 – 4) and (6 – 5)).
3. Finally, multiply all these together with the factor 10.

What is your next step? Please show your computation for P(6) using these pieces.
Student: To calculate \( P(6) \), we will evaluate the expression step by step as instructed:

1. Compute each factor:
   - \( 6 - 1 = 5 \)
   - \( 6 - 2 = 4 \)
   - \( 6 - 3 = 3 \)
   - \( 6 - 4 = 2 \)
   - \( 6 - 5 = 1 \)

2. Now, we apply the appropriate powers:
   - \( (6 - 4)^2 = 2^2 = 4 \)
   - \( (6 - 5)^3 = 1^3 = 1 \)

3. Now we can substitute these values into the expression for \( P(6) \):
   \[
   P(6) = 10 \cdot (6 - 1) \cdot (6 - 2) \cdot (6 - 3) \cdot (6 - 4)^2 \cdot (6 - 5)^3
   \]
   Substituting the computed values:
   \[
   P(6) = 10 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 1
   \]

4. Now, let's calculate it step by step:
   - First, multiply \( 5 \cdot 4 = 20 \)
   - Next, multiply \( 20 \cdot 3 = 60 \)
   - Then, multiply \( 60 \cdot 4 = 240 \)
   - Finally, multiply \( 240 \cdot 1 = 240 \)

5. Now, multiply by 10:
   \[
   P(6) = 10 \cdot 240 = 2400
   \]

Thus, the final result is:
\[
\boxed{2400}
\]
Teacher: You've done a wonderful job! Let's review the final step together:

We had  
 P(6) = 10 · (6 – 1) · (6 – 2) · (6 – 3) · (6 – 4)² · (6 – 5)³  
Calculating each factor:

 6 – 1 = 5  
 6 – 2 = 4  
 6 – 3 = 3  
 6 – 4 = 2, so (6 – 4)² = 2² = 4  
 6 – 5 = 1, so (6 – 5)³ = 1³ = 1  

Multiplying these gives:  
 5 · 4 · 3 · 4 · 1 = 240

Finally, multiplying by 10:  
 10 · 240 = 2400

Therefore, your final answer is: 2400$
