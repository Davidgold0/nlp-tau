Question: Let \[P(x) = (2x^4 - 26x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c)(5x^4 - 80x^3 + dx^2 + ex + f),\]where $a, b, c, d, e, f$ are real numbers. Suppose that the set of all complex roots of $P(x)$ is $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}.$ Find $P(6).$
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem together. We have

  P(x) = (2x⁴ – 26x³ + a x² + b x + c) · (5x⁴ – 80x³ + d x² + e x + f),

and we are told that the set of all complex roots of P(x) is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. In other words, although P(x) is of degree 8 (since it is a product of two quartics), it has only these five distinct roots, meaning some of these roots must have multiplicities greater than 1. 

An important observation is that by looking at each factor we get the sum of their roots (counted with multiplicity) by Vieta’s formulas. For example, the first polynomial has leading coefficient 2, and its coefficient of x³ is –26. What does that tell you about the sum of its four roots? (Remember: for a polynomial 2x⁴ – 26x³ + …, the sum of its roots is equal to (26 / 2) = 13, taking the sign into account.)

What do you think the next step should be? Can you explain how you would assign roots (from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}) to the first quartic so that the sum is 13? Please solve just this step.
Student: To find the roots for the first quartic polynomial \(2x^4 - 26x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c\), we need to ensure that the sum of its roots equals 13, as indicated by Vieta's formulas.

Since the roots must come from the set \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), we can assign multiplicities to these roots. We need to consider combinations of these numbers that add up to 13. 

One possible way to assign the roots is to have the root 1 with a multiplicity of 1, the root 2 with a multiplicity of 1, the root 3 with a multiplicity of 2, and the root 4 with a multiplicity of 1. This gives us:

- 1 (multiplicity 1)
- 2 (multiplicity 1)
- 3 (multiplicity 2)
- 4 (multiplicity 1)

Calculating the sum:

\[
1 \times 1 + 2 \times 1 + 3 \times 2 + 4 \times 1 = 1 + 2 + 6 + 4 = 13.
\]

This satisfies the requirement that the sum of the roots of the first quartic polynomial is 13. 

Next, we can move on to the second quartic polynomial. Would you like to discuss how we could assign roots to that polynomial next?
Teacher: You've made a good start by using Vieta’s formula, noticing that the sum of the four roots (with multiplicities) of the first quartic must be 13. However, take a moment to carefully check the count: a quartic polynomial should have exactly 4 roots (counting any multiple roots), but your proposal assigns five roots (1, 2, 3, 3, and 4). Could you try reassigning roots from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} so that exactly four numbers (with possibly one repeated if needed) sum to 13? For instance, consider a combination with all distinct roots or one pair repeated that still yields 4 total roots. What combination can you find?
Student: Thank you for your guidance. I see that I mistakenly assigned five roots instead of four. Let's find a combination of roots from the set \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\) that sums to 13 while ensuring we have exactly four roots.

One possible combination could be:

- Root 2 with a multiplicity of 2
- Root 3 with a multiplicity of 1
- Root 4 with a multiplicity of 1

Calculating the sum gives us:

\[
2 \times 2 + 3 \times 1 + 4 \times 1 = 4 + 3 + 4 = 11.
\]

This doesn't work. Let's try another combination.

If we assign:

- Root 3 with a multiplicity of 2
- Root 4 with a multiplicity of 1
- Root 5 with a multiplicity of 1

Calculating the sum:

\[
3 \times 2 + 4 \times 1 + 5 \times 1 = 6 + 4 + 5 = 15.
\]

This is too high. 

Let’s try:

- Root 1 with a multiplicity of 1
- Root 4 with a multiplicity of 2
- Root 5 with a multiplicity of 1

Calculating the sum:

\[
1 \times 1 + 4 \times 2 + 5 \times 1 = 1 + 8 + 5 = 14.
\]

Still not correct. 

Finally, let's try:

- Root 3 with a multiplicity of 1
- Root 4 with a multiplicity of 2
- Root 2 with a multiplicity of 1

Calculating the sum:

\[
3 \times 1 + 4 \times 2 + 2 \times 1 = 3 + 8 + 2 = 13.
\]

This works! 

So, for the first quartic polynomial, we can assign the roots as follows:

- 3 (multiplicity 1)
- 4 (multiplicity 2)
- 2 (multiplicity 1)

Now that we have the roots for the first quartic, how should we proceed to assign roots for the second quartic polynomial?
Teacher: Good work on finding a valid assignment for the first quartic! Let's review what we've determined so far:

• For the first quartic, with polynomial 2x⁴ – 26x³ + …, we need the four roots (with multiplicities) to sum to 13.  
• You've now assigned the roots as 3, 4, 4, and 2. (Their sum is 3 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 13.)

Now, let's look at the second quartic: 5x⁴ – 80x³ + …  
By Vieta’s formula, the sum of its four roots (with multiplicities) equals –(–80)/5 = 16.

Remember that the overall eight roots of P(x) (combining both quartics) must exactly be the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. That means the second quartic must supply the remaining multiplicities for each root so that, when combined with the first quartic, we see each of the roots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 appears at least once and no additional roots appear.

At this point, please focus solely on the following step:

Step: Select a combination of four roots (with possible repetition) from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} for the second quartic so that their sum is 16.  
• Which combination would work?  
• Explain your reasoning clearly.

Please provide your answer for this step.
Student: To find a combination of four roots (with possible repetition) from the set \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\) for the second quartic polynomial \(5x^4 - 80x^3 + \ldots\) such that their sum equals 16, we need to think about how we can use the roots we already assigned to the first quartic, which are 3, 4, 4, and 2.

Since we need the total sum of the roots of the second quartic to be 16, we can determine how many of each root we need to include from the set. The roots we have left to assign are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Let's analyze our options:

- The sum of the roots of the first quartic is 13 (from roots 3, 4, 4, and 2).
- We have 16 - 13 = 3 left to reach the total of 16 for the second quartic.

One possible combination that sums to 16 is:

- Root 1 with a multiplicity of 1
- Root 5 with a multiplicity of 1
- Root 4 with a multiplicity of 2

Calculating the sum gives us:

\[
1 \times 1 + 5 \times 1 + 4 \times 2 = 1 + 5 + 8 = 14.
\]

This does not work. Let's try again.

If we assign:

- Root 1 with a multiplicity of 1
- Root 2 with a multiplicity of 2
- Root 5 with a multiplicity of 1

Calculating the sum:

\[
1 \times 1 + 2 \times 2 + 5 \times 1 = 1 + 4 + 5 = 10.
\]

Still not correct. 

Let's try another combination:

- Root 2 with a multiplicity of 1
- Root 3 with a multiplicity of 1
- Root 5 with a multiplicity of 2

Calculating the sum:

\[
2 \times 1 + 3 \times 1 + 5 \times 2 = 2 + 3 + 10 = 15.
\]

Still not right.

After several attempts, I realize we can use:

- Root 1 with a multiplicity of 2
- Root 5 with a multiplicity of 1
- Root 4 with a multiplicity of 1

Calculating the sum:

\[
1 \times 2 + 5 \times 1 + 4 \times 1 = 2 + 5 + 4 = 11.
\]

Finally, how about this combination:

- Root 3 with a multiplicity of 2
- Root 5 with a multiplicity of 1
- Root 4 with a multiplicity of 1

Calculating the sum gives:

\[
3 \times 2 + 5 \times 1 + 4 \times 1 = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15.
\]

After several attempts, the correct combination that sums to 16 is:

- Root 4 with a multiplicity of 3
- Root 1 with a multiplicity of 1

Calculating the sum gives:

\[
4 \times 3 + 1 \times 1 = 12 + 1 = 13.
\]

After checking once more:

- Root 2 with a multiplicity of 3
- Root 5 with a multiplicity of 1

Calculating:

\[
2 \times 3 + 5 \times 1 = 6 + 5 = 11.
\]

Finally, I conclude that a valid combination for the second quartic polynomial is:

- Root 1 with a multiplicity of 1
- Root 5 with a multiplicity of 2
- Root 4 with a multiplicity of 1

Calculating the sum gives:

\[
1 + 5 + 5 + 4 = 15.
\]

I will keep working on this until I find the right combination. Would you like to help me with it?
Teacher: You're on the right track by noticing that the second quartic must contain 1 (since 1 does not appear in the first quartic) and that its four roots must add up to 16. Now, let’s think about this step carefully:

Step: Choose four numbers from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (allowing repeats) so that the sum is 16. Keep in mind that we already used 2, 3, 4, 4 in the first quartic. This means the overall union of roots (combining both quartics) must be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

A good hint: Since 1 hasn’t appeared yet in the first quartic, the second quartic must include 1. After including 1, the remaining three roots must add up to 16 – 1 = 15. 

Given that our roots can only be numbers from 1 to 5, ask yourself:
• What is the maximum total we can obtain with three entries from {1,2,3,4,5}?  
• Does any choice of three numbers from this set add to 15?

Please work through this reasoning and tell me which combination (including 1) would provide a total sum of 16 for the four roots of the second quartic. What combination do you propose?
Student: Thank you for your guidance! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

We need to find a combination of four roots (allowing for repeats) from the set \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\) that sums to 16. Since we must include the root 1 (as it hasn't appeared in the first quartic), we can start with that.

After including \(1\), we need the remaining three roots to sum to \(16 - 1 = 15\).

Now, let's consider the maximum sum we can achieve with three numbers from our set:

- The largest three distinct numbers from \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\) are \(3, 4, 5\), which sum to \(3 + 4 + 5 = 12\). This is not enough.
- We can also repeat some numbers to reach a higher sum.

Let’s explore some combinations:

1. **Using 1 and repeating 5**:
   - If we take \(1\) once and \(5\) three times:
   \[
   1 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 1 + 15 = 16.
   \]
   This works!

2. **Using 1, 4, and 5**:
   - If we take \(1\) once, \(4\) once, and \(5\) twice:
   \[
   1 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 1 + 4 + 10 = 15.
   \]
   This does not work.

3. **Using 1, 4, and 3**:
   - If we take \(1\) once, \(4\) twice, and \(3\) once:
   \[
   1 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 1 + 8 + 3 = 12.
   \]
   This does not work.

4. **Using 1, 4, and 2**:
   - If we take \(1\) once, \(4\) once, and \(2\) twice:
   \[
   1 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9.
   \]
   This does not work.

After testing various combinations, the one that works is:

- **1 (multiplicity 1)**
- **5 (multiplicity 3)**

So, the roots for the second quartic polynomial can be assigned as \(1, 5, 5, 5\).

Now we have:

- For the first quartic polynomial: \(2x^4 - 26x^3 + \ldots\) with roots \(2, 3, 4, 4\).
- For the second quartic polynomial: \(5x^4 - 80x^3 + \ldots\) with roots \(1, 5, 5, 5\).

This combination satisfies the requirement that the sum of the roots for the second quartic equals \(16\).

Shall we move on to calculate \(P(6)\) now?
Teacher: Great job so far! We now have factorized both quartic factors with the following roots:

• First quartic (2x⁴ – 26x³ + …) has roots: 2, 3, 4, 4  
• Second quartic (5x⁴ – 80x³ + …) has roots: 1, 5, 5, 5

This lets us write the factors as:
  First quartic = 2 · (x – 2)(x – 3)(x – 4)²  
  Second quartic = 5 · (x – 1)(x – 5)³

Thus, P(x) can be expressed as:
  P(x) = [2 · (x – 2)(x – 3)(x – 4)²] · [5 · (x – 1)(x – 5)³]

Now, we need to calculate P(6). To do that, follow these steps:

1. Substitute x = 6 into the factors. That means finding (6 – 2), (6 – 3), (6 – 4), (6 – 1), and (6 – 5).  
2. Carefully compute each difference.  
3. Remember to square (6 – 4) and cube (6 – 5) where required.  
4. Multiply all the numerical factors together, including the leading coefficients 2 and 5.

Please calculate the individual terms one by one and then combine them to find P(6). What is your next step?
Student: To calculate \( P(6) \), we start by substituting \( x = 6 \) into the factors of \( P(x) \):

1. **Calculate each term:**
   - \( (6 - 2) = 4 \)
   - \( (6 - 3) = 3 \)
   - \( (6 - 4) = 2 \)
   - \( (6 - 1) = 5 \)
   - \( (6 - 5) = 1 \)

2. **Now, we compute the necessary powers:**
   - Since \( (6 - 4) \) is squared:
     \[
     (6 - 4)^2 = 2^2 = 4
     \]
   - Since \( (6 - 5) \) is cubed:
     \[
     (6 - 5)^3 = 1^3 = 1
     \]

3. **Now we can substitute these values into the expression for \( P(6) \):**
   \[
   P(6) = 2 \cdot (6 - 2)(6 - 3)(6 - 4)^2 \cdot 5 \cdot (6 - 1)(6 - 5)^3
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   P(6) = 2 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 1
   \]

4. **Now calculate step by step:**
   - First, calculate \( 2 \cdot 4 = 8 \)
   - Then, calculate \( 8 \cdot 3 = 24 \)
   - Next, calculate \( 24 \cdot 4 = 96 \)
   - Then, calculate \( 96 \cdot 5 = 480 \)
   - Finally, calculate \( 480 \cdot 5 = 2400 \)

Thus, we find that:
\[
P(6) = 2400
\]

So, the final answer is \( P(6) = 2400 \).
Teacher: You've done a great job substituting x = 6 into each factor and computing the results step by step. Let’s quickly review your work:

1. For the first quartic 2(x – 2)(x – 3)(x – 4)², you correctly found:
  6 – 2 = 4, 6 – 3 = 3, 6 – 4 = 2, and (2)² = 4.

2. For the second quartic 5(x – 1)(x – 5)³, you correctly computed:
  6 – 1 = 5, 6 – 5 = 1, and (1)³ = 1.

3. Then multiplying all the parts together:
  Leading coefficients: 2 × 5 = 10.
  The factors: 4 · 3 · 4 = 48 for the first quartic and 5 · 1 = 5 for the second quartic.
  Finally, 10 · 48 · 5 = 2400.

Everything checks out. 

Final answer:
2400$
