Question: Let \[P(x) = (2x^4 - 26x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c)(5x^4 - 80x^3 + dx^2 + ex + f),\]where $a, b, c, d, e, f$ are real numbers. Suppose that the set of all complex roots of $P(x)$ is $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}.$ Find $P(6).$
3o-mini: We are given
  P(x) = (2x⁴ – 26x³ + ax² + bx + c) (5x⁴ – 80x³ + dx² + ex + f),
and we know that the complete set (ignoring multiplicity) of complex roots of P(x) is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

Step 1. Determine the overall multiplicities.

Since each of the two factors is a fourth‐degree polynomial, the product P(x) is an 8th–degree polynomial. Thus the total multiplicities of the five distinct roots must add up to 8. Let m₁, m₂, m₃, m₄, m₅ be the multiplicities for the roots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively so that:
  m₁ + m₂ + m₃ + m₄ + m₅ = 8.
Also, by Vieta’s formula (applied to the entire polynomial) the sum of the roots (counting multiplicity) should equal
  S = – (coefficient of x⁷)/(leading coefficient).
When multiplying out the two factors the highest-degree part is
  2x⁴ · 5x⁴ = 10x⁸,
and the x⁷ term comes from
  2x⁴ · (–80x³) + (–26x³) · 5x⁴ = –160x⁷ – 130x⁷ = –290x⁷.
Thus the sum of the roots is
  S = 290/10 = 29.
That is,
  1·m₁ + 2·m₂ + 3·m₃ + 4·m₄ + 5·m₅ = 29.
A little experimentation with positive integers that add to 8 shows that the choice
  m₁ = 1, m₂ = 1, m₃ = 1, m₄ = 2, m₅ = 3
works because
  1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 8  and  1 + 2 + 3 + 8 + 15 = 29.

Step 2. Partition the roots between the two factors.

Since each factor is a 4th–degree polynomial, each must have roots whose multiplicities add to 4. Moreover, their coefficients give us further information. Write the factors as

  Factor A: 2x⁴ – 26x³ + … and Factor B: 5x⁴ – 80x³ + … .

For any polynomial, the sum of its roots (with multiplicity) equals (–coefficient of x³)/(leading coefficient). Thus for Factor A, the sum of its roots is
  (26/2) = 13,
and for Factor B, the sum is
  (80/5) = 16.
We now assign the overall multiplicities between the factors. One possible partition is as follows:
 • Factor A (degree 4) has roots: 1, 3, 4, and 5 (each with multiplicity 1). Their sum is 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 13.
 • Then Factor B (degree 4) must have the remaining multiplicities:
  – Root 1: overall multiplicity 1, Factor A got 1, so Factor B gets 0.
  – Root 2: overall 1; assign 1 in Factor B.
  – Root 3: overall 1, Factor A got 1, so Factor B gets 0.
  – Root 4: overall 2; Factor A got 1 so Factor B gets 1.
  – Root 5: overall 3; Factor A got 1 so Factor B gets 2.
Then the roots for Factor B are: 2 (once), 4 (once), and 5 (twice), whose sum is 2 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 16.

Thus we can write the factors in factored form as:
  Factor A = 2·(x – 1)(x – 3)(x – 4)(x – 5),
  Factor B = 5·(x – 2)(x – 4)(x – 5)².

Step 3. Compute P(6).

Now substitute x = 6 in each factor.
 • Factor A(6):
  2·(6 – 1)(6 – 3)(6 – 4)(6 – 5) = 2·5·3·2·1 = 60.
 • Factor B(6):
  5·(6 – 2)(6 – 4)(6 – 5)² = 5·4·2·1² = 40.
Thus,
  P(6) = Factor A(6) · Factor B(6) = 60 · 40 = 2400.

Answer: 2400.
