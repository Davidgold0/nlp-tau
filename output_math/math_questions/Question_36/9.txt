3o-mini: We are given that θ is acute and

  sin 5θ = sin⁵ θ.

Step 1. Express sin 5θ in terms of sin θ.

Recall the multiple-angle formula:
  sin 5θ = 16 sin⁵θ – 20 sin³θ + 5 sinθ.

Thus, the equation becomes:
  16 sin⁵θ – 20 sin³θ + 5 sinθ = sin⁵θ.

Step 2. Rearrange the equation.

Subtract sin⁵θ from both sides:
  16 sin⁵θ – sin⁵θ – 20 sin³θ + 5 sinθ = 0
  15 sin⁵θ – 20 sin³θ + 5 sinθ = 0.

Factor out 5 sinθ:
  5 sinθ (3 sin⁴θ – 4 sin²θ + 1) = 0.

Since θ is acute, sinθ ≠ 0. Therefore, we must have:
  3 sin⁴θ – 4 sin²θ + 1 = 0.

Step 3. Solve the quartic equation by substitution.

Let x = sin²θ. Then the equation becomes:
  3x² – 4x + 1 = 0.

Factor or use the quadratic formula:
  (3x – 1)(x – 1) = 0.

This gives the solutions:
  x = 1/3 or x = 1.

Since sin²θ = 1 implies sinθ = 1 (θ = 90°) which is not an acute angle, we take:
  sin²θ = 1/3.

Step 4. Determine tan θ.

We have:
  sin²θ = 1/3 and cos²θ = 1 – sin²θ = 1 – 1/3 = 2/3.
Since θ is acute, cosθ > 0 so:
  cos θ = √(2/3) and sin θ = √(1/3).

Thus,
  tan θ = sin θ / cos θ = (√(1/3))/(√(2/3)) = √(1/2) = 1/√2.

Step 5. Compute tan 2θ.

Recall the double-angle formula for tangent:
  tan 2θ = (2 tan θ)/(1 – tan²θ).

Substitute tan θ = 1/√2:
  tan²θ = 1/2,
  tan 2θ = (2 * (1/√2)) / (1 – 1/2) = (2/√2) / (1/2).

Simplify the expression:
  2/√2 = √2,
  Then, tan 2θ = √2 / (1/2) = 2√2.

Thus, the value of tan 2θ is 2√2.
