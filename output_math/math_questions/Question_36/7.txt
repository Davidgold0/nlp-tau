3o-mini: We are given that

  sin 5θ = (sin θ)⁵

and θ is an acute angle (0 < θ < 90°). To solve the equation, we use the multiple-angle formula for sin 5θ:

  sin 5θ = 16 sin⁵θ − 20 sin³θ + 5 sin θ.

So, the equation becomes

  16 sin⁵θ − 20 sin³θ + 5 sin θ = sin⁵θ.

Subtract sin⁵θ from both sides:

  15 sin⁵θ − 20 sin³θ + 5 sin θ = 0.

Since θ is acute, sin θ ≠ 0, so we can divide through by sin θ:

  15 sin⁴θ − 20 sin²θ + 5 = 0.

Divide the entire equation by 5:

  3 sin⁴θ − 4 sin²θ + 1 = 0.

Let x = sin²θ. Then the equation becomes a quadratic:

  3x² − 4x + 1 = 0.

Solve this quadratic by the quadratic formula:

  x = [4 ± √(16 − 12)]/(2·3)
    = [4 ± √4]/6
    = [4 ± 2]/6.

This gives two solutions:

  x = (4 + 2)/6 = 1  or  x = (4 − 2)/6 = 1/3.

If sin²θ = 1, then sin θ = 1 and θ = 90°. However, θ is defined as an acute angle (strictly less than 90°) so we discard this solution. Therefore, we have

  sin²θ = 1/3  or  sin θ = 1/√3.

Next, find cos θ using the Pythagorean identity:

  cos²θ = 1 − sin²θ = 1 − 1/3 = 2/3,
  cos θ = √(2/3) = √2/√3    (since θ is acute and cosθ > 0).

Now, compute tan θ:

  tan θ = sin θ/cos θ = (1/√3) / (√2/√3) = 1/√2.

Finally, we find tan 2θ using the double-angle formula for tangent:

  tan 2θ = (2 tan θ) / (1 − tan²θ).

Substitute tan θ = 1/√2:

  tan²θ = 1/2,
  tan 2θ = (2·(1/√2)) / (1 − 1/2)
      = (2/√2) / (1/2)
      = (2/√2) × 2
      = 4/√2
      = (4√2)/2
      = 2√2.

Thus, the value of tan 2θ is 2√2.
