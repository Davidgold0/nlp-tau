Question: Mary and James each sit in a row of 7 chairs.  They choose their seats at random.  What is the probability that they don't sit next to each other?
3o-mini: Total number of seating arrangements is 7 choices for Mary times 6 remaining choices for James, which equals 42.

Next, count the arrangements where Mary and James sit next to each other. There are 6 pairs of adjacent chairs in a row of 7, and for each of these pairs, Mary and James can sit in 2 different orders (Mary on the left and James on the right, or vice versa). That makes 6 × 2 = 12 arrangements where they are adjacent.

Thus, the number of arrangements where they are not adjacent is 42 − 12 = 30.

The probability that they don't sit next to each other is 30/42, which simplifies to 5/7.

So, the answer is 5/7.
