Question: Mary and James each sit in a row of 7 chairs.  They choose their seats at random.  What is the probability that they don't sit next to each other?
3o-mini: There are 7 chairs. Mary can choose any of the 7 chairs, and then James can choose any of the remaining 6 chairs, giving a total of 7 × 6 = 42 possible seating arrangements.

Now, we count the arrangements where Mary and James sit next to each other. In a row of 7 chairs, there are 6 pairs of adjacent chairs (chairs 1-2, 2-3, …, 6-7). For each of these 6 pairs, Mary and James can swap positions, yielding 2 arrangements per pair. Thus, there are 6 × 2 = 12 arrangements where they sit next to each other.

Subtracting these from the total gives the number of arrangements where they do not sit next to each other:
42 − 12 = 30.

The probability that they do not sit next to each other is:
30/42 = 5/7.
