Question: Mary and James each sit in a row of 7 chairs.  They choose their seats at random.  What is the probability that they don't sit next to each other?
3o-mini: There are 7 chairs in total. Mary and James choose seats at random, and since they are distinct individuals, there are 7 choices for Mary's seat and 6 remaining choices for James' seat. This gives a total of 7 × 6 = 42 possible seating arrangements.

Next, count the number of arrangements where they sit next to each other. In a row of 7 chairs, there are 6 pairs of adjacent chairs (e.g., chairs 1-2, 2-3, ..., 6-7). For each adjacent pair, there are 2 ways to arrange Mary and James (Mary on the left and James on the right, and vice versa), for a total of 6 × 2 = 12 arrangements where they sit together.

To find the arrangements where they do not sit next to each other, subtract the adjacent arrangements from the total arrangements:  
42 − 12 = 30.

The probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other is therefore:  
30/42, which simplifies to 5/7.

Thus, the probability that they don’t sit next to each other is 5/7.
