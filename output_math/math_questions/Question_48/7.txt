Question: What is the value of $82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3$?  (No calculators!  And see if you can do it in your head!)
3o-mini: The expression given is of the form a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³. Recognize that this is the expansion of (a + b)³.

Here, a = 82 and b = 18, so:

82³ + 3(82²)(18) + 3(82)(18²) + 18³ = (82 + 18)³ = 100³ = 1,000,000.

Thus, the value of the expression is 1,000,000.
