Question: What is the value of $82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3$?  (No calculators!  And see if you can do it in your head!)
Teacher: Let's start by rephrasing the problem in our own words: We need to evaluate

  82³ + 3·82²·18 + 3·82·18² + 18³

Without jumping straight to the answer, we can notice that this expression closely matches a well-known algebraic expansion. 

Step 1: Look for a pattern. Does this expression remind you of any standard binomial expansion formula? Reflect on the formula for (a + b)³. 

Can you identify what a and b would be in this context? Please share your reasoning for this first step.
Student: Sure! The expression \( 82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3 \) does remind me of the binomial expansion formula for \((a + b)^3\), which is given by:

\[
a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3
\]

In this formula, \(a\) and \(b\) are the two terms being cubed. 

If we compare our expression to the binomial expansion, I can see that:

- \(a\) corresponds to \(82\)
- \(b\) corresponds to \(18\)

So, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
(82 + 18)^3
\]

Now, we can simplify \(82 + 18\). 

What do you think we should do next?
Teacher: Great job recognizing the binomial expansion pattern! You've correctly identified a = 82 and b = 18, and rewritten the expression as (82 + 18)³.

For the next step, please calculate the value of 82 + 18. What is that sum, and how did you arrive at it?
Student: Student: Thank you! The sum of \(82 + 18\) is \(100\). I arrived at this by simply adding the two numbers together: 

\[
82 + 18 = 100.
\]

Now that we have that, we can rewrite our expression as:

\[
(100)^3.
\]

What should we do next?
Teacher: You've simplified the expression to (100)³ – excellent work! 

Step 3: Now, let's calculate (100)³. How would you compute that? Please share your reasoning and calculation for (100)³.
Student: Student: To calculate \((100)^3\), I can use the property of exponents, which states that \(a^3 = a \times a \times a\). 

So, for \(100^3\), it can be expressed as:

\[
100 \times 100 \times 100.
\]

First, I can calculate \(100 \times 100\), which is:

\[
100 \times 100 = 10,000.
\]

Next, I multiply that result by \(100\):

\[
10,000 \times 100 = 1,000,000.
\]

Thus, \((100)^3 = 1,000,000\).

So, the final value of \(82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3\) is:

\[
\boxed{1,000,000}.
\] 

Is there anything else you would like me to clarify?
Teacher: Great job working through each step! You correctly recognized the binomial formula, simplified (82 + 18) to get 100, and then calculated 100³ as 1,000,000.

The final answer is:
1,000,000$
