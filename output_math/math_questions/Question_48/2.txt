Question: What is the value of $82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3$?  (No calculators!  And see if you can do it in your head!)
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem together. The expression is

  82³ + 3(82²)(18) + 3(82)(18²) + 18³.

A good first step is to notice any pattern in the expression. It looks very similar to the expansion of a binomial expression raised to a power. Can you identify which binomial expansion this might be and then tell me what the binomial expression would be (i.e., what are the two terms you are adding)?
Student: Yes, I see the pattern! The expression \(82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3\) resembles the expansion of the binomial expression \((a + b)^3\). 

In this case, I can identify \(a\) as \(82\) and \(b\) as \(18\). So, the binomial expression we are looking at is \((82 + 18)^3\).

Would you like me to proceed with calculating this value?
Teacher: Great job identifying the pattern! You've correctly recognized that the given expression is the expansion of (82 + 18)³.

Now, for the next step, could you please calculate the sum inside the parentheses? In other words, what is 82 + 18?
Student: Sure! The sum of \(82\) and \(18\) is:

\[
82 + 18 = 100.
\]

So, we have \((82 + 18)^3 = 100^3\). Would you like me to calculate \(100^3\) next?
Teacher: Very good! Now that you've found 82 + 18 equals 100, the next step is to calculate 100³. Could you please work out 100³ and tell me what you get?
Student: Sure! To calculate \(100^3\), I can use the fact that:

\[
100^3 = 100 \times 100 \times 100.
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. First, \(100 \times 100 = 10,000\).
2. Then, multiplying that result by \(100\): 
   \[
   10,000 \times 100 = 1,000,000.
   \]

So, \(100^3 = 1,000,000\). 

Therefore, the value of the original expression \(82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3\) is \(1,000,000\).
Teacher: Excellent work! Let's review what we did:

• You recognized the expression as the expansion of (82 + 18)³.
• You then computed the sum inside the parentheses: 82 + 18 = 100.
• Finally, you calculated 100³ = 1,000,000.

Your final answer is: 1,000,000$
