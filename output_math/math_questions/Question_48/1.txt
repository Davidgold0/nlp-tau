Question: What is the value of $82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3$?  (No calculators!  And see if you can do it in your head!)
Teacher: Let's start by carefully examining the expression:  
  82³ + 3(82²)(18) + 3(82)(18²) + 18³

Step 1: Look for any patterns that might simplify this expression. Does it remind you of any well-known binomial expansion formula? If so, which one? Please identify what the general formula is, and what values of a and b would match our expression.
Student: The expression \(82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3\) resembles the binomial expansion of \((a + b)^3\). The general formula for the expansion of \((a + b)^3\) is:

\[
a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3
\]

In our case, we can identify:

- \(a = 82\)
- \(b = 18\)

So, the expression can be rewritten as:

\[
(82 + 18)^3
\]

Now, can you calculate \(82 + 18\) and then raise that result to the power of 3?
Teacher: Excellent work identifying the pattern! You've recognized that the expression is the expansion of (a + b)³ with a = 82 and b = 18.

Now, for the next step, please calculate the sum 82 + 18. What result do you get for that sum?
Student: The sum \(82 + 18\) equals \(100\). 

Now, we can raise that result to the power of 3. So we need to calculate \(100^3\). Would you like me to do that next?
Teacher: Great job on getting the sum correctly! So far, you've rewritten the expression as (82 + 18)³, and you've correctly calculated that 82 + 18 equals 100.

Now, please calculate 100³. Remember, 100³ means 100 multiplied by itself three times (100 × 100 × 100). What's the value you obtain for 100³?
Student: Student: To calculate \(100^3\), I multiply \(100\) by itself three times:

\[
100 \times 100 \times 100
\]

First, I calculate \(100 \times 100\), which equals \(10,000\). 

Next, I multiply that result by \(100\):

\[
10,000 \times 100 = 1,000,000
\]

So, \(100^3 = 1,000,000\). 

Therefore, the value of the original expression \(82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3\) is \(1,000,000\).
Teacher: Great job! You've carefully identified the pattern and used the binomial expansion (a + b)³ with a = 82 and b = 18. Then you correctly computed that 82 + 18 = 100 and recognized that 100³ equals 100 × 100 × 100. You've worked through each step diligently.

So, after rewriting the expression as (82 + 18)³ and computing 100³, you've reached the final value.

1,000,000$
