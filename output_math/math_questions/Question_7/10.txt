Question: Given that $n$ is an integer and $0 < 4n <30$, what is the sum of all possible integer values of $n$?
3o-mini: We start with the inequality:

  0 < 4n < 30

Dividing all parts by 4 (since 4 is positive) gives:

  0 < n < 7.5

Since n must be an integer, the possible values are n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

To find the sum of these values:

  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28

Thus, the sum of all possible integer values of n is 28.
