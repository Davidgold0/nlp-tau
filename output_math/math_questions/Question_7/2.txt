Question: Given that $n$ is an integer and $0 < 4n <30$, what is the sum of all possible integer values of $n$?
Teacher: Great, let's work through this problem step by step. 

First, we have the inequality 0 < 4n < 30 for an integer n, and our goal is to find the sum of all possible values of n that satisfy this inequality.

As the first step, try isolating n by dividing the entire inequality by 4. Could you go ahead and perform that division? Tell me what the inequality becomes after dividing by 4.
Student: Sure! If we divide the entire inequality \(0 < 4n < 30\) by 4, we get:

\[
0 < n < \frac{30}{4}
\]

Simplifying \(\frac{30}{4}\) gives us:

\[
0 < n < 7.5
\]

So the inequality now is \(0 < n < 7.5\). 

What should I do next?
Teacher: Great job isolating n! Now, recall that n is an integer and our inequality is 0 < n < 7.5. For the next step, please list all the possible integer values of n that satisfy this inequality. What integers do you get?
Student: Thank you! The integers that satisfy the inequality \(0 < n < 7.5\) are \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\). 

Now, what should I do with these integer values?
Teacher: Great work listing the integers! Now, we need to compute the sum of these integers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Could you please add these up and tell me what the sum is?
Student: Sure! To find the sum of the integers \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\), we can add them together:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28
\]

So, the sum of all possible integer values of \(n\) is \(28\). Would you like me to explain how I calculated this sum?
Teacher: Great job on reaching the final sum of 28! Before we confirm your final answer, I'd like you to explain your process for calculating that sum. You mentioned adding 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 to get 28. Could you please elaborate on your reasoning? For instance, did you add the numbers one by one, or did you use a formula for summing an arithmetic sequence? Let me know your approach so we can review it together.
Student: Student: Sure! To calculate the sum of the integers \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\), I added them together one by one, like this:

\[
1 + 2 = 3 \\
3 + 3 = 6 \\
6 + 4 = 10 \\
10 + 5 = 15 \\
15 + 6 = 21 \\
21 + 7 = 28
\]

So, by adding them sequentially, I arrived at the total of 28. 

Alternatively, I could have used the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is given by:

\[
S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l)
\]

where \(n\) is the number of terms, \(a\) is the first term, and \(l\) is the last term. In this case, there are 7 terms (from 1 to 7), the first term \(a\) is 1, and the last term \(l\) is 7. Plugging in these values, we get:

\[
S_7 = \frac{7}{2} \times (1 + 7) = \frac{7}{2} \times 8 = 7 \times 4 = 28
\]

Either way, I confirmed that the sum of all possible integer values of \(n\) is indeed \(28\). Does that make sense?
Teacher: Excellent explanation! You've clearly demonstrated both the sequential addition method and the use of the arithmetic series formula to arrive at the sum of 28. You've isolated n correctly, identified the valid integers from the inequality, and computed their sum correctly by two different methods.

To summarize our process:
1. We started with the inequality 0 < 4n < 30.
2. You divided each part by 4 to obtain 0 < n < 7.5.
3. Since n must be an integer, you correctly identified the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
4. Then, you calculated the sum of these integers, arriving at 28 by both sequential addition and the arithmetic series formula.

Your reasoning at every step is sound, and your explanation of your approach was clear and comprehensive.
