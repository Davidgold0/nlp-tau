Question: Given that $n$ is an integer and $0 < 4n <30$, what is the sum of all possible integer values of $n$?
Teacher: Let's start by rephrasing the problem and outlining our plan together:

We have the inequality 0 < 4n < 30, and we know n is an integer. One way to approach this problem is:

Step 1: Divide the entire inequality by 4 to find the range of n.
Step 2: Identify all integer values of n that lie within that range.
Step 3: Add up those integer values.

To begin, could you work on Step 1? What do you get when you divide 0 < 4n < 30 by 4?
Student: Sure! When I divide the entire inequality \(0 < 4n < 30\) by 4, I get:

\[
0 < n < 7.5
\]

This means that \(n\) must be greater than 0 and less than 7.5. 

What's the next step?
Teacher: Great job on dividing the inequality! Your answer 0 < n < 7.5 is correct. Now, let's move on to Step 2.

Given that n is an integer and must satisfy 0 < n < 7.5, what are all the integer values that meet this condition? Please list them, and then we'll discuss your answer.
Student: Student: The integer values of \(n\) that satisfy the condition \(0 < n < 7.5\) are:

\[
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
\]

These are all the integers greater than 0 and less than or equal to 7. 

What should I do next?
Teacher: Good work listing the integer values! Now, let's move on to Step 3:

Step 3: Add up the integers you listed (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7).

Could you calculate the sum of these numbers? Please show your calculations, and we'll review your work together.
Student: Sure! To find the sum of the integers \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \) and \(7\), I will add them together step by step:

\[
1 + 2 = 3
\]
\[
3 + 3 = 6
\]
\[
6 + 4 = 10
\]
\[
10 + 5 = 15
\]
\[
15 + 6 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 7 = 28
\]

So, the sum of all the integer values of \(n\) is \(28\).

Is that correct?
Teacher: Excellent work! Your calculations in Step 3 are spot on and you've correctly added the numbers to obtain 28.

To summarize:  
• We divided the inequality 0 < 4n < 30 by 4 to get 0 < n < 7.5.  
• We identified the integer values of n as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.  
• Finally, by adding these integers together, we found the sum is 28.

If you're happy with all the steps and the reasoning, please state your final answer.
Student: The final answer is \(28\). Thank you for guiding me through the steps!
Teacher: Great work! You've followed every step carefully:
1. Dividing the inequality 0 < 4n < 30 by 4 gave 0 < n < 7.5.
2. This yielded the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
3. Adding these integers together gave a sum of 28.

Since you've reached the final answer, you would now state it exactly as follows:

28$
