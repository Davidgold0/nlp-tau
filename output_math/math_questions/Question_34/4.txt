Question: Suppose that I have an unlimited supply of identical math books, history books, and physics books.  All are the same size, and I have room on a shelf for 8 books.  In how many ways can I arrange eight books on the shelf if no two books of the same type can be adjacent?
Teacher: Let’s start by breaking down the problem into smaller steps. We have to fill 8 positions on a shelf with books of three types (math, history, and physics), with the restriction that no two adjacent books are of the same type.

Here’s one way to outline the steps:

1. First, note that the first book can be chosen freely from the three types.
2. For every subsequent book (positions 2 through 8), you must choose a type that is different from the book that comes immediately before it.
3. Determine how many choices you have for each position.
4. Multiply the number of choices for each position together to obtain the total number of possible arrangements.

Let’s begin with the first step: What is the number of choices you have for the first book on the shelf?
Student: For the first book on the shelf, I can choose freely from any of the three types of books: math, history, or physics. Therefore, I have **3 choices** for the first book. 

Shall we move on to the next step?
Teacher: That's correct—the first book indeed has 3 choices. Great job!

Now, let's move on to the next step. Consider the second book in the sequence: What are the choices you have for the second book, given that it must be a different type from the first book? Please focus only on this next step and share your reasoning.
Student: Student: For the second book, since it cannot be the same type as the first book, I have 2 remaining choices. If the first book is, for example, a math book, I can choose either a history or a physics book for the second position. 

So, I have **2 choices** for the second book. 

Shall we proceed to the next step?
Teacher: Excellent work identifying 3 choices for the first book and 2 choices for the second book!

Now, let's carefully consider the third book. Remember, at every step after the first, the book must differ from the one immediately before it. Think about what happens for the third book: How many choices do you have for its type? Please share your reasoning.
Student: Student: For the third book, I also have 2 choices. This is because it must be different from the second book, just like the second book was different from the first. Regardless of what the second book is, I can choose from the other two types that are not adjacent to it. 

So, I have **2 choices** for the third book. 

Shall we continue to the next step?
Teacher: Great explanation! You've correctly identified that the third book has 2 choices because it must simply be different from the second book.

Now, let’s move on to the next step. Consider the fourth book on the shelf. Remember, the restriction is still that the fourth book cannot be of the same type as the third book. What do you think are your choices for the fourth book, and why? Please focus solely on this step and share your reasoning.
Student: Student: For the fourth book, I also have **2 choices**. This is because it must be different from the third book, just like the previous books. Regardless of what the third book is, I can choose from the other two types that are not adjacent to it. 

Shall we proceed to the next step?
Teacher: Great job on explaining the fourth book! Your reasoning for having 2 choices at each step after the first is spot on.

Now, let's move on to the next step. Consider the fifth book on the shelf. Based on what you've determined so far, can you explain how many choices you have for the fifth book and why? Please focus only on this next step and share your reasoning.
Student: Student: For the fifth book, I also have **2 choices**. This is because the fifth book must be different from the fourth book, just like the previous books. Regardless of what the fourth book is, I can choose from the other two types that are not adjacent to it.

Shall we continue to the next step?
Teacher: Great job reasoning so far! You've correctly noted that for book 5, there are 2 choices because it must differ from book 4.

Now, let's move on to the next step: Consider the sixth book. What are the choices available for the sixth book, and why? Please focus solely on explaining the possible choices for the sixth book and share your reasoning.
Student: Student: For the sixth book, I also have **2 choices**. This is because the sixth book must be different from the fifth book, just like the previous books. No matter what type the fifth book is, I can choose from the other two types that are not adjacent to it.

Shall we move on to the next step?
Teacher: Great work so far! You've correctly explained the reasoning for books 1 through 6.

Now let's consider the seventh book on the shelf. Given that the only restriction is that this book must be of a different type than the sixth book, please tell me: How many choices do you have for the seventh book, and what is your explanation for this? Focus solely on this step.
Student: Student: For the seventh book, I also have **2 choices**. This is because the seventh book must be different from the sixth book, just like the previous books. Regardless of what type the sixth book is, I can choose from the other two types that are not adjacent to it.

Shall we proceed to the final step?
Teacher: Excellent work on reaching the seventh book! Now let's move on to the final step: the eighth book on the shelf. Just like before, the only restriction for the eighth book is that it must be a different type from the book immediately before it (the seventh book). 

What are the choices available for the eighth book, and why? Please focus solely on this step and share your reasoning.
Student: Student: For the eighth book, I also have **2 choices**. This is because the eighth book must be different from the seventh book, just like the previous books. Regardless of what type the seventh book is, I can choose from the other two types that are not adjacent to it.

Now that we've determined the choices for all eight books, would you like me to summarize the total number of arrangements?
Teacher: Great work walking through each step! Let's summarize the process:

• For the first book, you have 3 choices since there’s no preceding book.
• For each of the following books (positions 2 through 8), you have 2 choices because each book must be different from the one immediately before it.
• Multiplying these together, the total number of arrangements is 3 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2, which simplifies to 3 × 2⁷.

Calculating that gives 3 × 128 = 384.

So the total number of possible arrangements is 384$
