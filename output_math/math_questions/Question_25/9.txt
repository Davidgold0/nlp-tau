Question: Find the area of a triangle with side lengths 8, 9, and 9.
3o-mini: Let the side lengths be a = 8, b = 9, and c = 9.

Step 1: Calculate the semiperimeter (s):
  s = (a + b + c) / 2 = (8 + 9 + 9) / 2 = 26 / 2 = 13

Step 2: Use Heron’s formula to find the area (A):
  A = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]

Substitute the values:
  A = √[13 × (13 - 8) × (13 - 9) × (13 - 9)]
  A = √[13 × 5 × 4 × 4]
  A = √[13 × 80]
  A = √1040

Step 3: Simplify √1040:
  1040 can be factored as 16 × 65, so:
  √1040 = √(16 × 65) = √16 × √65 = 4√65

Thus, the area of the triangle is 4√65.
