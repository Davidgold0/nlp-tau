Question: Find the area of a triangle with side lengths 8, 9, and 9.
3o-mini: To find the area of a triangle with side lengths 8, 9, and 9, we can use Heron's formula. Heron's formula states that the area (A) of a triangle with sides a, b, and c is:

  A = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]

where s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle:

  s = (a + b + c) / 2

Step 1: Calculate the semi-perimeter.
  s = (8 + 9 + 9) / 2 = 26 / 2 = 13

Step 2: Apply Heron's formula.
  A = √[13(13 - 8)(13 - 9)(13 - 9)]
    = √[13 × 5 × 4 × 4]
    = √(13 × 80)
    = √1040

Step 3: Simplify the square root.
  1040 = 16 × 65, so:
  A = √(16 × 65) = √16 × √65 = 4√65

Thus, the area of the triangle is 4√65 square units.
