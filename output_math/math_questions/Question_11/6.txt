Question: Natasha has more than $\$1$ but less than $\$10$ worth of dimes. When she puts her dimes in stacks of 3, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 4, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 5, she also has 1 left over. How many dimes does Natasha have?
3o-mini: Let d be the number of dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, having more than $1 and less than $10 means:

  $1 < 0.10d < 10$

Multiplying through by 10 gives:

  $10 < d < 100$

Natasha organizes her dimes as follows:
• When grouped in stacks of 3, there is 1 left: d ≡ 1 (mod 3)
• When grouped in stacks of 4, there is 1 left: d ≡ 1 (mod 4)
• When grouped in stacks of 5, there is 1 left: d ≡ 1 (mod 5)

Notice that in each case, d − 1 is a multiple of the divisor. So we have:
  d − 1 is divisible by 3, 4, and 5.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5 is 60, so:
  d − 1 = 60k  for some integer k

Thus:
  d = 60k + 1

Now, because 10 < d < 100, let’s find the integer values of k:
• For k = 0: d = 1 (too few dimes)
• For k = 1: d = 60(1) + 1 = 61 (which fits within our range)
• For k = 2: d = 121 (which is too many)

Therefore, Natasha has 61 dimes.

To double-check:
• 61 divided by 3 is 20 R1
• 61 divided by 4 is 15 R1
• 61 divided by 5 is 12 R1

Everything checks out.
