Question: Natasha has more than $\$1$ but less than $\$10$ worth of dimes. When she puts her dimes in stacks of 3, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 4, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 5, she also has 1 left over. How many dimes does Natasha have?
3o-mini: Let the number of dimes be n. Since Natasha has more than $1 and less than $10 in dimes, and each dime is $0.10, we have:
  10 < n < 100

The problem states:
  n ≡ 1 (mod 3)
  n ≡ 1 (mod 4)
  n ≡ 1 (mod 5)

Notice that in each case n − 1 is divisible by the divisor. That means:
  n − 1 is divisible by 3, 4, and 5.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5 is 60, so we have:
  n − 1 = 60k  for some integer k
  n = 60k + 1

Now we find k such that 10 < n < 100:
  If k = 0, then n = 1 (too small).
  If k = 1, then n = 61.
  If k = 2, then n = 121 (too large).

Thus, the only solution within the range is n = 61.

Therefore, Natasha has 61 dimes.
