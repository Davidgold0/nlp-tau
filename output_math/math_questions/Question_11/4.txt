Question: Natasha has more than $\$1$ but less than $\$10$ worth of dimes. When she puts her dimes in stacks of 3, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 4, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 5, she also has 1 left over. How many dimes does Natasha have?
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem in our own words. Natasha has a number of dimes between 11 and 99 (because more than $1 means at least 11 dimes and less than $10 means at most 99 dimes). We’re told that if she arranges the dimes in stacks of 3, 4, or 5, she always has 1 dime remaining. 

A good way to approach this is to express the situation using congruences. In other words, if we call the number of dimes d, we can write:

  d ≡ 1 (mod 3)
  d ≡ 1 (mod 4)
  d ≡ 1 (mod 5)

Now, there is a helpful observation here: if d leaves a remainder of 1 in all these divisions, then (d – 1) must be divisible by 3, 4, and 5. That is, d – 1 is a common multiple of 3, 4, and 5.

For our next step, I’d like you to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5 and explain why it’s important in writing an expression for d. What is the LCM, and how can we use it to express d?
Student: To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5, we first need to identify the prime factors of each number:

- The prime factorization of 3 is \(3\).
- The prime factorization of 4 is \(2^2\).
- The prime factorization of 5 is \(5\).

To determine the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations:

- For the prime \(2\), the highest power is \(2^2\) from 4.
- For the prime \(3\), the highest power is \(3^1\) from 3.
- For the prime \(5\), the highest power is \(5^1\) from 5.

Now, we multiply these together to get the LCM:

\[
\text{LCM}(3, 4, 5) = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 = 4 \times 3 \times 5
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. \(4 \times 3 = 12\)
2. \(12 \times 5 = 60\)

So, the LCM of 3, 4, and 5 is \(60\).

Now, since \(d - 1\) must be a multiple of 60, we can express this as:

\[
d - 1 = 60k \quad \text{for some integer } k
\]

This leads us to:

\[
d = 60k + 1
\]

Next, we need to find the values of \(k\) such that \(d\) is between 11 and 99. 

Let's compute the values of \(d\) for different integer values of \(k\):

- For \(k = 0\):
  \[
  d = 60 \times 0 + 1 = 1 \quad (\text{not valid, as it's less than 11})
  \]

- For \(k = 1\):
  \[
  d = 60 \times 1 + 1 = 61 \quad (\text{valid, as it's between 11 and 99})
  \]

- For \(k = 2\):
  \[
  d = 60 \times 2 + 1 = 121 \quad (\text{not valid, as it's greater than 99})
  \]

Thus, the only value of \(d\) that fits all the conditions is \(61\).

So, Natasha has **61 dimes**.
Teacher: Great work outlining your solution! Let’s review what you’ve done so far. You correctly found the LCM of 3, 4, and 5 to be 60 and then expressed the number of dimes as 

  d = 60k + 1

for some integer k. Now, the next step is to determine which value(s) of k produce a number d that is between the correct limits. Remember, since each dime is 10 cents, having more than $1 means Natasha must have at least 11 dimes, and having less than $10 means she has at most 99 dimes.

Could you please explain how you decide which k values are acceptable by setting up and solving the inequality 11 ≤ 60k + 1 ≤ 99? What values of k do you get, and what reasoning leads you to these choices?
Student: To find the acceptable values for \(k\) that keep \(d\) between 11 and 99, we can set up the inequality:

\[
11 \leq 60k + 1 \leq 99
\]

We can break this down into two separate inequalities:

1. \(11 \leq 60k + 1\)
2. \(60k + 1 \leq 99\)

### Solving the First Inequality

Starting with the first inequality:

\[
11 \leq 60k + 1
\]

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:

\[
10 \leq 60k
\]

Now, dividing both sides by 60 results in:

\[
\frac{10}{60} \leq k \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{1}{6} \leq k
\]

Since \(k\) must be an integer, the smallest integer \(k\) can be is \(1\).

### Solving the Second Inequality

Now, we solve the second inequality:

\[
60k + 1 \leq 99
\]

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:

\[
60k \leq 98
\]

Dividing both sides by 60 results in:

\[
k \leq \frac{98}{60} \quad \Rightarrow \quad k \leq \frac{49}{30} \quad \Rightarrow \quad k \leq 1.63
\]

Since \(k\) must also be an integer, the largest integer \(k\) can be is \(1\).

### Conclusion

From both inequalities, we find that:

\[
1 \leq k \leq 1
\]

This means the only acceptable integer value for \(k\) is \(1\). 

Now, substituting \(k = 1\) back into the equation for \(d\):

\[
d = 60 \times 1 + 1 = 61
\]

Thus, the only value of \(d\) that satisfies all conditions is \(61\). 

So, Natasha has **61 dimes**.
Teacher: You've done an excellent job setting up and solving the inequality to determine the acceptable value of k. Your breakdown of 11 ≤ 60k + 1 ≤ 99 into two separate inequalities, solving for k, and concluding that k = 1 is indeed the only candidate shows a clear understanding of the logical process. 

Now that you've verified k = 1 and substituted it back to confirm that d = 60(1) + 1 = 61 fits the conditions, you're ready to present your final answer. 

Please state your final answer (with the reasoning summarized) as you would complete the solution. What is the final number of dimes Natasha has?
Student: Based on our analysis, we determined that Natasha has a number of dimes \(d\) expressed as:

\[
d = 60k + 1
\]

where \(k\) must be an integer. We set up the inequality to ensure \(d\) is between 11 and 99:

\[
11 \leq 60k + 1 \leq 99
\]

Solving this inequality, we found that the only integer value for \(k\) that satisfies both parts is \(k = 1\). Substituting \(k = 1\) back into the equation gives:

\[
d = 60 \times 1 + 1 = 61
\]

Thus, the final answer is that Natasha has **61 dimes**. This number satisfies all the conditions given in the problem, confirming that it is indeed the correct solution.
Teacher: Great job working through each step! We started by setting up the congruences for d:

  d ≡ 1 (mod 3)  
  d ≡ 1 (mod 4)  
  d ≡ 1 (mod 5)

Recognizing that d – 1 must be divisible by 3, 4, and 5, we computed the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5 to be 60, so we expressed d as:
  d = 60k + 1

Next, we set up the inequality 11 ≤ 60k + 1 ≤ 99 (because more than $1 means at least 11 dimes and less than $10 means at most 99 dimes) and solved it to see that the only integer value possible for k is 1. Substituting k = 1 into the equation gave us:

  d = 60(1) + 1 = 61

Thus, the final answer is:

61$
