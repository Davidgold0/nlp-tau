Question: Solve for $n$: $|n + 6| = 2 - n$.
Teacher: Let's start by outlining the process to solve this problem:

1. Restate the equation and identify any constraints.  
   • Since the equation is |n + 6| = 2 – n, notice that the expression 2 – n must be nonnegative (because an absolute value is always nonnegative).  
2. Set up the cases based on the absolute value definition.  
   • Case 1: n + 6 is nonnegative.  
   • Case 2: n + 6 is negative.  
3. Solve the equation within each case.  
4. Check the solutions against the constraints (both the case conditions and the requirement 2 – n ≥ 0).  
5. Conclude with the valid solution.

Now, let’s begin with the first step:

Step 1: Determine what condition must be true for 2 – n since it is equal to an absolute value. Could you explain what restriction we must have for 2 – n?
Student: Sure! For the expression \(2 - n\) to be valid in the equation \(|n + 6| = 2 - n\), it must be nonnegative. This means we need:

\[
2 - n \geq 0
\]

Rearranging this inequality gives us:

\[
n \leq 2
\]

So the condition we must have is that \(n\) must be less than or equal to 2. Would you like me to move on to the next step?
Teacher: Excellent work on Step 1! You've correctly determined that 2 – n must be nonnegative, so n must be less than or equal to 2.

Now, let’s move on to Step 2. We need to set up the cases for the absolute value. Let's start with the first case.

Case 1: Assume that n + 6 is nonnegative (n + 6 ≥ 0). Under this assumption, the absolute value |n + 6| equals n + 6.

Could you please write down the resulting equation for Case 1 and simplify it as much as possible? Take your time and share your reasoning!
Student: Student: Sure! In Case 1, we assume that \(n + 6 \geq 0\). This means we can replace \(|n + 6|\) with \(n + 6\) in the equation. 

So, the equation becomes:

\[
n + 6 = 2 - n
\]

Now, let’s simplify this equation. First, I’ll add \(n\) to both sides:

\[
n + n + 6 = 2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2n + 6 = 2
\]

Next, I’ll subtract 6 from both sides:

\[
2n = 2 - 6
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2n = -4
\]

Now, I’ll divide both sides by 2:

\[
n = -2
\]

So, for Case 1, we find \(n = -2\). 

Now, should I check if this solution meets the condition \(n + 6 \geq 0\) and \(n \leq 2\)?
Teacher: Great job on setting up and solving the equation for Case 1! You correctly derived n = -2 from the equation n + 6 = 2 - n. Now, before moving on, we need to verify that this solution satisfies the conditions of the case.

For Case 1, recall we assumed:
1. n + 6 ≥ 0  
2. Additionally, from the original equation, we require 2 - n ≥ 0 (i.e., n ≤ 2).

Could you please check these conditions for n = -2? Explain your reasoning step-by-step.
Student: Student: Sure! Let's check the conditions for \(n = -2\):

1. **Condition from Case 1**: We assumed \(n + 6 \geq 0\).
   - Substituting \(n = -2\):
   \[
   -2 + 6 = 4 \geq 0
   \]
   - This condition is satisfied.

2. **Condition from the original equation**: We also need to ensure that \(2 - n \geq 0\) (which means \(n \leq 2\)).
   - Substituting \(n = -2\):
   \[
   2 - (-2) = 2 + 2 = 4 \geq 0
   \]
   - This condition is also satisfied.

Since both conditions are met for \(n = -2\), we can conclude that this solution is valid for Case 1.

Shall I proceed to Case 2 now?
Teacher: Great job on verifying the conditions for Case 1! Now, let’s move on to Case 2.

For Case 2, we assume that n + 6 is negative (i.e., n + 6 < 0). Under this assumption, the absolute value |n + 6| becomes –(n + 6).

Could you please set up the new equation for Case 2 using this idea and simplify it? Remember to keep in mind the original condition n ≤ 2 along with the case condition. Take your time and share your reasoning step-by-step!
Student: Student: Sure! In Case 2, we assume that \(n + 6 < 0\). This means we can replace \(|n + 6|\) with \(- (n + 6)\) in the equation.

So, the equation becomes:

\[
-(n + 6) = 2 - n
\]

Now, let’s simplify this equation step-by-step. First, distributing the negative sign on the left side gives us:

\[
-n - 6 = 2 - n
\]

Next, we can add \(n\) to both sides:

\[
-n + n - 6 = 2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-6 = 2
\]

Now, this is a contradiction since -6 does not equal 2. Therefore, there are no solutions from Case 2.

Before we conclude, we should also check the conditions we set for Case 2. We assumed \(n + 6 < 0\), which implies:

\[
n < -6
\]

However, since we found no valid solutions from this case, we don’t have to worry about the original condition \(n \leq 2\).

So, the only valid solution we have is from Case 1, which is \(n = -2\). 

Should I summarize our findings or is there anything else you would like me to do?
Teacher: You've done an excellent job working through both cases and checking all conditions. Let's summarize our process:

1. We noted that the right side of the equation, 2 – n, must be nonnegative, which gave the constraint n ≤ 2.
2. In Case 1, we assumed n + 6 ≥ 0, replaced |n + 6| with n + 6, and solved the equation to find n = -2. We then verified that this solution satisfies both n + 6 ≥ 0 and n ≤ 2.
3. In Case 2, we assumed n + 6 < 0, replaced |n + 6| with –(n + 6), and simplified the equation, which led to a contradiction. Thus, no solutions came from this case.
4. Since only n = -2 met all the conditions, it is our valid solution.

So, the final answer is:

-2$
