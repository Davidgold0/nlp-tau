Question: Compute_x000D_
\[\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 0 & -1 \\ 7 & 4 & -3 \\ 2 & 2 & 5 \end{vmatrix}.\]
Teacher: Let's work through this determinant problem step by step without jumping directly to the final answer.

Step 1: Outline Your Plan
We need to compute the determinant of the 3×3 matrix:
  [ 2  0  -1 ]
  [ 7  4  -3 ]
  [ 2  2  5 ]

One common approach is to use cofactor expansion (also called Laplace expansion). A good first step is to decide along which row or column you want to expand. 

Which row or column do you choose to expand on, and why? Please share your reasoning for this choice.
Student: I think it might be best to expand along the first row because it has a zero in it. This will simplify our calculations since any term multiplied by zero will equal zero, reducing the number of terms we need to compute. 

So, I’ll expand along the first row, which is:

\[
\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 0 & -1 \end{vmatrix}
\]

This means I will calculate:

\[
2 \cdot \begin{vmatrix} 4 & -3 \\ 2 & 5 \end{vmatrix} - 0 \cdot \begin{vmatrix} 7 & -3 \\ 2 & 5 \end{vmatrix} - 1 \cdot \begin{vmatrix} 7 & 4 \\ 2 & 2 \end{vmatrix}
\]

Since the second term will be zero, I will only need to compute the first and third determinants. Does that sound like a good plan?
Teacher: That's a very good plan! You've correctly chosen the first row for expansion because it includes a zero, which will simplify the work. Now, let’s move on to the next step:

Please compute the two 2×2 determinants:
1. The determinant of the matrix 
  [ 4   –3 ]
  [ 2   5 ]
2. The determinant of the matrix 
  [ 7   4 ]
  [ 2   2 ]

Work through these calculations step by step, and then share your results.
Student: Student: Great! I'll compute the two 2×2 determinants one at a time.

1. **Determinant of the matrix** 
   \[
   \begin{vmatrix} 4 & -3 \\ 2 & 5 \end{vmatrix}
   \]
   The formula for the determinant of a 2×2 matrix 
   \[
   \begin{vmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{vmatrix} = ad - bc
   \]
   Applying this to our matrix:
   \[
   = (4)(5) - (-3)(2) = 20 + 6 = 26
   \]

2. **Determinant of the matrix** 
   \[
   \begin{vmatrix} 7 & 4 \\ 2 & 2 \end{vmatrix}
   \]
   Using the same formula:
   \[
   = (7)(2) - (4)(2) = 14 - 8 = 6
   \]

Now, I have the determinants:
- The first determinant is **26**.
- The second determinant is **6**.

Next, I can substitute these values back into my expansion. Would you like me to do that?
Teacher: Great work computing the two 2×2 determinants! Now that you have:

 • det[[4, –3], [2, 5]] = 26  
 • det[[7, 4], [2, 2]] = 6

Let's move on to the next step: Substituting these values back into your cofactor expansion of the 3×3 determinant.

Recall your expansion along the first row was:
  2 · (first minor) – 0 · (second minor) – 1 · (third minor)

Now, please set up that expression by substituting the values 26 and 6 that you computed, and then simplify it step by step. What expression do you get, and what is the final value?
Student: Student: Alright! Let's substitute the values we computed back into the expression for the determinant.

The expression from the cofactor expansion along the first row is:
\[
2 \cdot \begin{vmatrix} 4 & -3 \\ 2 & 5 \end{vmatrix} - 0 \cdot \begin{vmatrix} 7 & -3 \\ 2 & 5 \end{vmatrix} - 1 \cdot \begin{vmatrix} 7 & 4 \\ 2 & 2 \end{vmatrix}
\]

Now substituting the values we found:
\[
= 2 \cdot 26 - 0 \cdot ( \text{anything} ) - 1 \cdot 6
\]

Since the second term is zero, we can ignore it:
\[
= 2 \cdot 26 - 6
\]

Now, calculating this step-by-step:
1. \(2 \cdot 26 = 52\)
2. Then, \(52 - 6 = 46\)

So, the final value of the determinant is:
\[
\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 0 & -1 \\ 7 & 4 & -3 \\ 2 & 2 & 5 \end{vmatrix} = 46
\]

Does that look correct to you?
Teacher: Great job! Your substitution and simplification are correct. You correctly computed the two 2×2 determinants and substituted them into the expansion along the first row. Your calculation—

 2 × 26 – 1 × 6 = 52 – 6 = 46

—is accurate, and every step was well-reasoned. 

Before we wrap up, can you briefly explain why the sign for the third term remains negative (i.e., why you subtract the product of the third element with its minor) in the cofactor expansion? Please share your thoughts on the role of the (-1)^(i+j) factor in this context.
Student: Student: Absolutely! The sign in the cofactor expansion is determined by the position of the element in the matrix, specifically by the formula \((-1)^{i+j}\), where \(i\) is the row number and \(j\) is the column number of the element.

In our case, we expanded along the first row:

1. The first element \(2\) is in position (1,1), so \(i+j = 1+1 = 2\), which is even, and thus the sign is positive.
2. The second element \(0\) is in position (1,2), so \(i+j = 1+2 = 3\), which is odd, giving a negative sign. However, since this term is multiplied by zero, it doesn't affect the final result.
3. The third element \(-1\) is in position (1,3), so \(i+j = 1+3 = 4\), which is even, resulting in a positive sign for the minor. However, since we are subtracting the product of this element with its minor, it effectively contributes negatively to the determinant.

So, the reason we subtract the third term is due to the fact that the minor associated with an element in an odd position (like (1,3) in the context of the cofactor expansion) will be multiplied by \(-1\), leading to the final subtraction in our expression.

This alternating sign pattern is crucial in ensuring that the determinant reflects the geometric properties of the matrix, such as orientation and area (or volume in higher dimensions). 

Thank you for guiding me through this problem!
Teacher: Excellent explanation! Your reasoning regarding the (-1)^(i+j) factor is spot on. Since each term in the cofactor expansion carries a sign based on its position, you correctly noted that for the third element at position (1,3), even though (-1)^(1+3) gives a positive sign, the entry itself is -1, causing that term to subtract its minor from the sum.

To summarize:
1. You chose to expand along the first row to simplify the calculation because of the zero.
2. You accurately computed the two necessary 2×2 determinants:
  • det([[4, -3], [2, 5]]) = 26
  • det([[7, 4], [2, 2]]) = 6
3. Substituting back into the cofactor expansion gave:
  2·26 – 0·(anything) – 1·6 = 52 – 6 = 46

Your final computed determinant is:
46$
