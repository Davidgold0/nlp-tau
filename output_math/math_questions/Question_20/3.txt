Question: Compute_x000D_
\[\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 0 & -1 \\ 7 & 4 & -3 \\ 2 & 2 & 5 \end{vmatrix}.\]
Teacher: Let's begin by outlining the steps we can follow to compute the determinant of the 3×3 matrix:

1. Recognize that you can calculate the determinant of a 3×3 matrix by using cofactor expansion (it’s often easiest to expand along a row or column with zeros). For this matrix, note that the first row (2, 0, -1) has a zero, which can simplify your work.
2. Using the first row, set up the cofactor expansion. This means writing the determinant as:
  a₁₁ * det(M₁₁) − a₁₂ * det(M₁₂) + a₁₃ * det(M₁₃)
 where a₁₁, a₁₂, and a₁₃ are the entries in the first row, and M₁₁, M₁₂, and M₁₃ are the 2×2 minor matrices formed by deleting the corresponding row and column.
3. Compute each 2×2 determinant (minor) for these cofactors.
4. Combine the results to get the final determinant of the 3×3 matrix.

Now, for our first step: Can you set up the cofactor expansion along the first row and write out the expressions involving a₁₁, a₁₂, and a₁₃ along with their corresponding 2×2 determinants? Take your time, and let me know what you get for this setup.
Student: Sure! Following your guidance, I'll set up the cofactor expansion along the first row of the matrix:

The matrix is:
\[
\begin{vmatrix} 
2 & 0 & -1 \\ 
7 & 4 & -3 \\ 
2 & 2 & 5 
\end{vmatrix}.
\]

Using the first row for the cofactor expansion, we have:

- \( a_{11} = 2 \)
- \( a_{12} = 0 \)
- \( a_{13} = -1 \)

The cofactor expansion formula becomes:
\[
\text{det} = a_{11} \cdot \text{det}(M_{11}) - a_{12} \cdot \text{det}(M_{12}) + a_{13} \cdot \text{det}(M_{13}),
\]
where \( M_{ij} \) is the minor matrix formed by deleting the \( i \)-th row and \( j \)-th column.

Now, let's identify the minors:

1. For \( M_{11} \) (deleting the first row and first column):
\[
M_{11} = \begin{vmatrix} 4 & -3 \\ 2 & 5 \end{vmatrix}.
\]

2. For \( M_{12} \) (deleting the first row and second column):
\[
M_{12} = \begin{vmatrix} 7 & -3 \\ 2 & 5 \end{vmatrix}.
\]

3. For \( M_{13} \) (deleting the first row and third column):
\[
M_{13} = \begin{vmatrix} 7 & 4 \\ 2 & 2 \end{vmatrix}.
\]

Putting it all together, the determinant can be expressed as:
\[
\text{det} = 2 \cdot \text{det}(M_{11}) - 0 \cdot \text{det}(M_{12}) - 1 \cdot \text{det}(M_{13}).
\]

Since \( a_{12} \) is zero, we can ignore that term. 

So, it simplifies to:
\[
\text{det} = 2 \cdot \text{det}(M_{11}) - \text{det}(M_{13}).
\]

What would you like me to do next? Should I compute the determinants of the minors \( M_{11} \) and \( M_{13} \)?
Teacher: Great job setting up the cofactor expansion correctly! Now, as the next step, let’s compute the determinants of the two 2×2 minors you identified:  
 • M₁₁ = |4  -3|  
     |2   5|  
 • M₁₃ = |7   4|  
     |2   2|  

Remember, the determinant of a 2×2 matrix  
 |a  b|  
 |c  d|  
is computed as (a*d - b*c).

Please calculate det(M₁₁) and det(M₁₃) using this rule and share your results.
Student: Student: Thank you for the guidance! I'll calculate the determinants of the minors \( M_{11} \) and \( M_{13} \) using the formula for the determinant of a 2×2 matrix.

1. For \( M_{11} = \begin{vmatrix} 4 & -3 \\ 2 & 5 \end{vmatrix} \):
   \[
   \text{det}(M_{11}) = (4 \cdot 5) - (-3 \cdot 2) = 20 + 6 = 26.
   \]

2. For \( M_{13} = \begin{vmatrix} 7 & 4 \\ 2 & 2 \end{vmatrix} \):
   \[
   \text{det}(M_{13}) = (7 \cdot 2) - (4 \cdot 2) = 14 - 8 = 6.
   \]

Now that I have the determinants, we can substitute these values back into the expression for the determinant of the original 3×3 matrix:

\[
\text{det} = 2 \cdot \text{det}(M_{11}) - \text{det}(M_{13}) = 2 \cdot 26 - 6.
\]

Would you like me to compute this final expression?
Teacher: Excellent work so far! Now, for the final step, please compute the expression:

  det = 2 × 26 – 6

What result do you get? Please show your work, and let’s check it together.
Student: Sure! I will compute the final expression step by step:

\[
\text{det} = 2 \cdot 26 - 6.
\]

First, calculate \( 2 \cdot 26 \):

\[
2 \cdot 26 = 52.
\]

Next, subtract 6 from 52:

\[
52 - 6 = 46.
\]

So, the determinant of the original 3×3 matrix is:

\[
\text{det} = 46.
\]

Thank you for your guidance! Is there anything else you would like to discuss regarding this problem?
Teacher: Great work! Your final calculation indicates that the determinant of the matrix is 46. 

To summarize what we did:  
1. We set up the cofactor expansion along the first row.  
2. We computed the two necessary 2×2 determinants: 26 for M₁₁ and 6 for M₁₃.  
3. Finally, we calculated 2 × 26 − 6, which is 46.

Final answer:
46$
