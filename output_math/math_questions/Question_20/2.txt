Question: Compute_x000D_
\[\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 0 & -1 \\ 7 & 4 & -3 \\ 2 & 2 & 5 \end{vmatrix}.\]
Teacher: Let's rephrase the problem in our own words and then outline the steps we’ll take:

We need to find the determinant of the 3x3 matrix:  
  [ 2   0  -1 ]  
  [ 7   4  -3 ]  
  [ 2   2   5 ]

A common approach is to use cofactor expansion (also known as Laplace expansion). Here’s an outline of the steps:

1. Choose a row (or column) along which to expand. Decide which row (or column) looks easiest to work with and explain your reasoning.
2. For each element in that row (or column), determine its minor (which is the determinant of the 2x2 submatrix obtained by removing the element’s row and column).
3. Apply the sign factor (using the checkerboard pattern of + and -) to each term.
4. Sum up the products of the chosen element, its sign factor, and its minor’s determinant.
5. Simplify to obtain the final value.

Let’s start with the first step:
Which row (or column) would you choose to expand along, and why?
Student: I would choose to expand along the first row, which is \([2, 0, -1]\). The reason I think this row is the easiest to work with is because it contains a zero. Expanding along a row or column with a zero simplifies our calculations, as we can skip the term associated with that zero. 

Shall we proceed with the next step?
Teacher: Great choice! Expanding along the first row is a smart move. Now let's proceed to the next step.

Step 2: For each nonzero element in the first row, we need to find its corresponding 2×2 minor. Let's start with the entry in the first row, first column (which is 2). 

Question: Can you identify the 2×2 submatrix (minor) that remains when you remove the first row and the first column? Then, please compute its determinant. 

Take your time and let me know your answer for this step!
Student: Student: When we remove the first row and the first column from the matrix, we are left with the following 2x2 submatrix:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} 
4 & -3 \\ 
2 & 5 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Now, to compute the determinant of this 2x2 matrix, we use the formula for the determinant of a 2x2 matrix, which is given by:

\[
\text{det} \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix} = ad - bc
\]

In our case, \( a = 4 \), \( b = -3 \), \( c = 2 \), and \( d = 5 \). 

So, the determinant is:

\[
\text{det} = (4)(5) - (-3)(2) = 20 + 6 = 26
\]

Thus, the determinant of the 2x2 minor is 26. 

Shall I proceed to find the next minor for the second nonzero element in the first row, which is -1?
Teacher: Great job! Your work on the first minor is spot on.

Now, let's move on to the next step for the first row. We need to find the 2×2 minor for the entry in the first row, third column, which is –1. Remember to remove the first row and the third column from the original matrix to obtain the submatrix.

Could you please identify that 2×2 submatrix and compute its determinant? Focus on just this step.
Student: Sure! When we remove the first row and the third column from the original matrix, we have the following 2x2 submatrix:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} 
7 & 4 \\ 
2 & 2 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Now, to compute the determinant of this 2x2 matrix, we again use the formula for the determinant of a 2x2 matrix:

\[
\text{det} \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix} = ad - bc
\]

In this case, \( a = 7 \), \( b = 4 \), \( c = 2 \), and \( d = 2 \). 

So, the determinant is:

\[
\text{det} = (7)(2) - (4)(2) = 14 - 8 = 6
\]

Therefore, the determinant of this 2x2 minor is 6. 

Shall I now summarize the contributions from the first row to find the overall determinant of the original matrix?
Teacher: Great job computing both minors!

Now that we have:
 • For the (1,1) entry: 2 and its minor’s determinant is 26.
 • For the (1,3) entry: –1 and its minor’s determinant is 6.

Recall when using the cofactor expansion along the first row, we need to include the sign factors. The pattern for the first row is (+, –, +).

So the contributions become:
 • From the (1,1) element: +2 × 26.
 • From the (1,2) element: 0 (so we can ignore it).
 • From the (1,3) element: + (–1) × 6 (since the sign for the third element in the first row is +).

Now, could you please write the expression that sums these contributions to give the determinant? Take your time and share your next step!
Student: Sure! Based on the contributions we've calculated from the first row, we can write the expression for the determinant of the original matrix as follows:

1. For the (1,1) entry, we have:
   \[
   +2 \times 26 = 52
   \]

2. For the (1,2) entry, since it is zero, we have:
   \[
   0
   \]

3. For the (1,3) entry, we have:
   \[
   -1 \times 6 = -6
   \]

Now, combining these contributions, the expression for the determinant is:
\[
\text{det} = 52 + 0 - 6
\]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[
\text{det} = 52 - 6 = 46
\]

Therefore, the determinant of the original matrix is 46. Would you like me to summarize everything we've done or clarify any part of the process?
Teacher: Excellent work! Your expression and computations are all correct, and you've clearly shown each step. The final answer for the determinant is 46.
