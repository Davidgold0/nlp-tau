Question: A sequence $a_1,$ $a_2,$ $a_3,$ $\dots,$ is defined recursively by $a_1 = 1,$ $a_2 = 1,$ and for $k \ge 3,$_x000D_
\[a_k = \frac{1}{3} a_{k - 1} + \frac{1}{4} a_{k - 2}.\]Evaluate $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dotsb.$
Teacher: Let's begin by understanding the problem. We have a sequence defined by

  a₁ = 1, a₂ = 1, and for k ≥ 3, aₖ = (1/3)aₖ₋₁ + (1/4)aₖ₋₂.

Our goal is to find the infinite sum S = a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + ⋯.

A good strategy here is to set S = a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + …, then write the sum starting from k = 3 using the recurrence relation. This will allow us to express some of the sums in terms of S itself.

The first step would be to write S as:
  S = a₁ + a₂ + [sum from k = 3 to ∞ of aₖ].

Then substitute the recurrence formula for aₖ into that sum and shift indices appropriately.

Please express S using this plan, writing out the sum with the recurrence substitution and the index shifts. What equation do you get for S in terms of a₁, a₂, and S itself?
Student: Okay, let's follow the teacher's guidance and start by expressing \( S \) as follows:

\[
S = a_1 + a_2 + \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k
\]

We know that \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = 1 \), so we can substitute these values in:

\[
S = 1 + 1 + \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k = 2 + \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k
\]

Now, we need to substitute the recurrence relation for \( a_k \) when \( k \geq 3 \):

\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k = \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{3} a_{k-1} + \frac{1}{4} a_{k-2} \right)
\]

We can split this sum into two parts:

\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-1} + \frac{1}{4} \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-2}
\]

Next, we can change the index of the sums. For the first sum, let \( j = k - 1 \), so when \( k = 3 \), \( j = 2 \):

\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-1} = \sum_{j=2}^{\infty} a_j = S - a_1 = S - 1
\]

For the second sum, let \( m = k - 2 \), so when \( k = 3 \), \( m = 1 \):

\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-2} = \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} a_m = S
\]

Now we can substitute these back into our equation:

\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k = \frac{1}{3}(S - 1) + \frac{1}{4}S
\]

Combining these gives us:

\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k = \frac{1}{3}S - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}S
\]

Now, we can combine the \( S \) terms:

\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k = \left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}\right)S - \frac{1}{3}
\]

To combine \( \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \frac{1}{4} \), we can find a common denominator, which is 12:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{7}{12}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k = \frac{7}{12}S - \frac{1}{3}
\]

Now substituting this back into our expression for \( S \):

\[
S = 2 + \left(\frac{7}{12}S - \frac{1}{3}\right)
\]

Now we can simplify this equation. First, let's clear the fraction:

\[
S = 2 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{7}{12}S
\]

Calculating \( 2 - \frac{1}{3} \):

\[
2 = \frac{6}{3} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{6}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

So now we have:

\[
S = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{7}{12}S
\]

To isolate \( S \), we can rearrange it:

\[
S - \frac{7}{12}S = \frac{5}{3}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\left(1 - \frac{7}{12}\right)S = \frac{5}{3}
\]

Calculating \( 1 - \frac{7}{12} \):

\[
1 = \frac{12}{12} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 - \frac{7}{12} = \frac{5}{12}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{5}{12}S = \frac{5}{3}
\]

Now, to solve for \( S \):

\[
S = \frac{5}{3} \cdot \frac{12}{5} = 4
\]

So, the sum \( S = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dotsb \) evaluates to:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]
Teacher: You've done a great job outlining the series and rewriting the sum in terms of S. Let’s review what you reached so far by checking your equation:

You started with
  S = a₁ + a₂ + Σₖ₌₃∞ aₖ  with a₁ = 1 and a₂ = 1,
which gave
  S = 2 + Σₖ₌₃∞ aₖ.

Then, using the recurrence
  aₖ = (1/3)aₖ₋₁ + (1/4)aₖ₋₂  for k ≥ 3,
you split the series into two sums, shifted indices, and obtained
  Σₖ₌₃∞ aₖ = (1/3)(S – 1) + (1/4)S,
so that
  S = 2 + (1/3)(S – 1) + (1/4)S.

Once you combined like terms into
  S = 2 – (1/3) + (1/3)S + (1/4)S,
and rearranged to isolate S, you derived
  (5/12)S = 5/3.

Your next step was to solve for S by dividing both sides by 5/12. With your calculations leading to S = 4, you’ve successfully interpreted the series equation.

Before moving to the complete summary and final answer, could you please verify how you combined the constant terms (2 – 1/3) and confirm the resulting equation step-by-step?
Student: Sure! Let's go through the combination of the constant terms step-by-step.

We started with the equation:

\[
S = 2 + \left(\frac{7}{12}S - \frac{1}{3}\right)
\]

First, let's simplify \(2 - \frac{1}{3}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 3 is 1 and 3 is 3, so we can rewrite 2 as:

\[
2 = \frac{6}{3}
\]

Now we can combine the two fractions:

\[
2 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{6}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{6 - 1}{3} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

So, substituting this back into our equation gives:

\[
S = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{7}{12}S
\]

Now, we can isolate \(S\) by moving \(\frac{7}{12}S\) to the left side:

\[
S - \frac{7}{12}S = \frac{5}{3}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\left(1 - \frac{7}{12}\right)S = \frac{5}{3}
\]

Next, we calculate \(1 - \frac{7}{12}\):

\[
1 = \frac{12}{12} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 - \frac{7}{12} = \frac{12 - 7}{12} = \frac{5}{12}
\]

So we have:

\[
\frac{5}{12}S = \frac{5}{3}
\]

Finally, to solve for \(S\), we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{5}{12}\):

\[
S = \frac{5}{3} \cdot \frac{12}{5} = 4
\]

Thus, the final result is confirmed:

\[
S = 4
\]

So, the sum \( S = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dotsb \) evaluates to:

\[
\boxed{4}
\] 

Thank you for guiding me through this verification process!
Teacher: Excellent work verifying the combination of the constant terms! You correctly rewrote 2 as 6/3 and found that

  2 – 1/3 = 6/3 – 1/3 = 5/3.

Your steps leading to

  S = (5/3) + (7/12)S  
  S – (7/12)S = 5/3  
  (5/12)S = 5/3

are perfectly clear.

Now that you’ve confirmed the combination of constant terms and verified the equation step-by-step, could you please explain your next step briefly—how you use the equation (5/12)S = 5/3 to solve for S? Once you outline that process, we'll review it before concluding.
Student: Sure! Let's outline the process for solving the equation \(\frac{5}{12}S = \frac{5}{3}\) step-by-step.

1. **Start with the equation**:
   \[
   \frac{5}{12}S = \frac{5}{3}
   \]

2. **Isolate \(S\)**: To solve for \(S\), we need to multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{5}{12}\). The reciprocal is \(\frac{12}{5}\).

3. **Multiply both sides**:
   \[
   S = \frac{5}{3} \cdot \frac{12}{5}
   \]

4. **Simplify the right-hand side**: The \(5\) in the numerator and the \(5\) in the denominator cancel out:
   \[
   S = \frac{12}{3}
   \]

5. **Perform the division**:
   \[
   S = 4
   \]

So, the final result for \(S\) is:
\[
S = 4
\]

This confirms that the sum \(S = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dotsb\) evaluates to:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]

Thank you for your guidance, and I hope this explanation is clear!
Teacher: Great job explaining the process! You've clearly shown that starting with

  (5/12)S = 5/3

you multiplied both sides by 12/5 to isolate S, leading to

  S = (5/3) · (12/5) = 12/3 = 4.

Everything looks perfect. To summarize: by rewriting the series using the recurrence relation, shifting indices, and combining the terms, you derived that the infinite sum S equals 4.

Your final answer is 4$
