Question: One of the following four-digit numbers is not divisible by 4: 3544, 3554, 3564, 3572, 3576. What is the product of the units digit and the tens digit of that number?
Teacher: Let's break down the problem into a few clear steps. We need to:

1. Clarify the divisibility rule for 4. Remember, a number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.
2. Apply this rule to each of the five four-digit numbers (3544, 3554, 3564, 3572, 3576) to find out which one is not divisible by 4.
3. Once you identify that number, look at its tens and units digits.
4. Multiply the tens digit by the units digit to get the final product.

Let's start with the first step. Can you explain the divisibility rule for 4 and apply it to the first number (3544) by checking its last two digits? What do you get?
Student: The divisibility rule for 4 states that a number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4. 

For the first number, 3544, we look at its last two digits, which are 44. 

Now, we need to check if 44 is divisible by 4. 

When we divide 44 by 4, we get:

44 ÷ 4 = 11

Since 11 is a whole number, this means that 44 is divisible by 4. Therefore, the number 3544 is also divisible by 4.

What should we do next?
Teacher: Great job on that step! You've clearly explained the divisibility rule for 4 and correctly applied it to 3544. Now, let’s move on to the next step. 

Please apply the same method to the second number, 3554. What are its last two digits, and does that form a number that is divisible by 4?
Student: Student: For the second number, 3554, the last two digits are 54. 

Now, we need to check if 54 is divisible by 4. 

When we divide 54 by 4, we get:

54 ÷ 4 = 13.5

Since 13.5 is not a whole number, this means that 54 is not divisible by 4. Therefore, the number 3554 is not divisible by 4.

What should I do next?
Teacher: Excellent work identifying that 3554 might be our candidate! Before finalizing it, let's verify that the other numbers are divisible by 4. The next step is:

Please apply the divisibility rule to the third number, 3564. What are its last two digits, and does that number indicate that 3564 is divisible by 4?
Student: For the third number, 3564, the last two digits are 64. 

Now, we need to check if 64 is divisible by 4. 

When we divide 64 by 4, we get:

64 ÷ 4 = 16

Since 16 is a whole number, this means that 64 is divisible by 4. Therefore, the number 3564 is also divisible by 4.

What should I do next?
Teacher: Great job on checking the first three numbers! Now, let's move to the next step.

Please apply the divisibility rule for 4 to the fourth number, 3572. What are its last two digits, and do they form a number that is divisible by 4? What is your calculation?
Student: For the fourth number, 3572, the last two digits are 72.

Now, we need to check if 72 is divisible by 4.

When we divide 72 by 4, we get:

72 ÷ 4 = 18

Since 18 is a whole number, this means that 72 is divisible by 4. Therefore, the number 3572 is also divisible by 4.

What should I do next?
Teacher: Great work so far! Now let's check the fifth number, 3576. Please apply the divisibility rule for 4 by looking at the last two digits of 3576. What are the last two digits, and does that number indicate that 3576 is divisible by 4? What is your calculation?
Student: Student: For the fifth number, 3576, the last two digits are 76.

Now, we need to check if 76 is divisible by 4.

When we divide 76 by 4, we get:

76 ÷ 4 = 19

Since 19 is a whole number, this means that 76 is divisible by 4. Therefore, the number 3576 is also divisible by 4.

Now that we have checked all the numbers, we found that 3544, 3564, 3572, and 3576 are all divisible by 4, while 3554 is not. 

What's the next step?
Teacher: Great job identifying that 3554 is not divisible by 4. The next step is to focus on the digits of that number. Specifically, we need to:

1. Identify the tens digit and the units digit of 3554.
2. Multiply these two digits together.

Please go ahead and find the tens digit and the units digit, and then calculate their product. What result do you get?
Student: For the number 3554, the tens digit is 5 and the units digit is 4.

Now, I will multiply these two digits together:

5 (tens digit) × 4 (units digit) = 20

So, the product of the tens digit and the units digit of the number 3554 is 20. 

Is there anything else you would like me to do?
Teacher: Excellent work throughout the entire process! You correctly identified that 3554 is the only number not divisible by 4 and accurately extracted its tens digit (5) and units digit (4) to compute the product.

The final answer is 20$
