Question: One of the following four-digit numbers is not divisible by 4: 3544, 3554, 3564, 3572, 3576. What is the product of the units digit and the tens digit of that number?
3o-mini: To determine which number is not divisible by 4, look at the last two digits of each number:

• 3544 → Last two digits: 44 (divisible by 4)  
• 3554 → Last two digits: 54 (54 ÷ 4 = 13.5, not divisible by 4)  
• 3564 → Last two digits: 64 (divisible by 4)  
• 3572 → Last two digits: 72 (divisible by 4)  
• 3576 → Last two digits: 76 (divisible by 4)

Thus, the number that is not divisible by 4 is 3554.

Now, the tens digit in 3554 is 5 and the units digit is 4. The product of these two digits is:

5 × 4 = 20

The final answer is 20.
