Question: One of the following four-digit numbers is not divisible by 4: 3544, 3554, 3564, 3572, 3576. What is the product of the units digit and the tens digit of that number?
3o-mini: To determine whether a number is divisible by 4, we only need to look at its last two digits. A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.

Let's examine each number:

• 3544 → Last two digits: 44. Since 44 ÷ 4 = 11, it is divisible by 4.
• 3554 → Last two digits: 54. Since 54 ÷ 4 = 13.5 (not an integer), it is not divisible by 4.
• 3564 → Last two digits: 64. Since 64 ÷ 4 = 16, it is divisible by 4.
• 3572 → Last two digits: 72. Since 72 ÷ 4 = 18, it is divisible by 4.
• 3576 → Last two digits: 76. Since 76 ÷ 4 = 19, it is divisible by 4.

Thus, the only number that is not divisible by 4 is 3554.

Now, we need the product of the units digit and the tens digit of 3554. The digits are:
• Thousands: 3
• Hundreds: 5
• Tens: 5
• Units: 4

The product of the tens digit and the units digit is 5 × 4 = 20.

So, the final answer is 20.
