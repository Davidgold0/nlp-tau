Question: 
Let \[P(x) = (2x^4 - 26x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c)(5x^4 - 80x^3 + dx^2 + ex + f),\]where $a, b, c, d, e, f$ are real numbers. Suppose that the set of all complex roots of $P(x)$ is $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}.$ Find $P(6).$

Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem together. We are given

  P(x) = (2x⁴ – 26x³ + a·x² + b·x + c)(5x⁴ – 80x³ + d·x² + e·x + f),

and we know that the complete set of (complex) roots of P(x) is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Because P(x) is an 8th‑degree polynomial, the five distinct numbers from the set must appear with multiplicities that add up to 8.

One good way to begin is to notice that the two factors are 4th‑degree polynomials. This means each factor has exactly four roots (counting multiplicities). Also, using Vieta’s formulas, we can deduce that:

 • For the first factor 2x⁴ – 26x³ + …, the sum of its roots is 26/2 = 13.
 • For the second factor 5x⁴ – 80x³ + …, the sum of its roots is 80/5 = 16.

Here’s an outline of a plan to solve the problem:

Step 1. Realize that the overall 8 roots come from the union (with repetition) of the roots of the two 4th‑degree factors.
Step 2. Since every number from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} must appear, assign multiplicities m₁, m₂, m₃, m₄, m₅ (each at least 1) so that m₁ + m₂ + m₃ + m₄ + m₅ = 8.
Step 3. Use the information about the sums of roots in each factor (13 for the first factor, 16 for the second) to “split” the five numbers between the two factors. In other words, decide which numbers (and with what repetition) can be the roots of the first 4th‑degree factor (adding to 13) and which for the second (adding to 16). (Hint: Think about a possible assignment where one factor’s four roots might be 1, 3, 4, and 5, and the other factor’s four roots might be 2, 4, 5, 5.)
Step 4. Once a valid assignment is found, use the fact that P(x) factors (except for the leading constants 2 and 5) as a product of linear factors. Then, since the overall leading coefficient is 2×5 = 10, you can express
  P(x) = 10 · (x – 1)¹ · (x – 2)¹ · (x – 3)¹ · (x – 4)^(? multiplicity) · (x – 5)^(? multiplicity),
with the exponents determined by your assignment.
Step 5. Finally, compute P(6) by substituting x = 6 into this factorization.

Let’s start with the first step together: find a way to assign the roots to the two factors (keeping in mind their sum conditions of 13 and 16) so that overall every number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 appears with the correct total multiplicity (which must sum to 8). 

What do you think could be a good assignment for the roots in each 4th‑degree factor? Please try to solve that assignment step, and then we can work from there.
Student: To assign the roots to the two 4th-degree factors while ensuring that the sums of the roots meet the conditions of 13 and 16, we can start by testing different combinations of the roots {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

Let's denote the first factor's roots as \( r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4 \) and the second factor's roots as \( r_5, r_6, r_7, r_8 \). We need to find a combination such that:

1. The sum of the roots for the first factor is \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 = 13 \).
2. The sum of the roots for the second factor is \( r_5 + r_6 + r_7 + r_8 = 16 \).
3. The total multiplicities of the roots must add up to 8.

One possible assignment could be:

- **First factor:** \( 1, 3, 4, 5 \)
- **Second factor:** \( 2, 4, 5, 5 \)

Now, let's check the sums:

- For the first factor:
  \[
  1 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 13
  \]
- For the second factor:
  \[
  2 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 16
  \]

Both conditions are satisfied, and we have accounted for all roots with the correct multiplicities:

- Roots 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 appear with multiplicities of 1, 1, 1, 2, and 2 respectively, which sums to 8.

Now we can express \( P(x) \) in terms of its factors:

\[
P(x) = 10 \cdot (x - 1)^1 \cdot (x - 2)^1 \cdot (x - 3)^1 \cdot (x - 4)^2 \cdot (x - 5)^2
\]

Next, we can compute \( P(6) \) by substituting \( x = 6 \) into the expression:

\[
P(6) = 10 \cdot (6 - 1)^1 \cdot (6 - 2)^1 \cdot (6 - 3)^1 \cdot (6 - 4)^2 \cdot (6 - 5)^2
\]

Calculating each term:

- \( (6 - 1) = 5 \)
- \( (6 - 2) = 4 \)
- \( (6 - 3) = 3 \)
- \( (6 - 4) = 2 \) (squared gives \( 2^2 = 4 \))
- \( (6 - 5) = 1 \) (squared gives \( 1^2 = 1 \))

Now, substituting these values in:

\[
P(6) = 10 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 1
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. \( 5 \cdot 4 = 20 \)
2. \( 20 \cdot 3 = 60 \)
3. \( 60 \cdot 4 = 240 \)
4. \( 240 \cdot 1 = 240 \)
5. \( 10 \cdot 240 = 2400 \)

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
P(6) = 2400
\] 

Is there anything specific you would like me to clarify or elaborate on?
Teacher: I like the way you started by assigning the roots according to the sum conditions. Let’s review your assignment carefully before moving on.

You proposed:
 • First factor’s roots: 1, 3, 4, 5  (sum = 1+3+4+5 = 13)  
 • Second factor’s roots: 2, 4, 5, 5  (sum = 2+4+5+5 = 16)

This assignment gives us the following overall counts:
 – Root 1 appears once.  
 – Root 2 appears once.  
 – Root 3 appears once.  
 – Root 4 appears once in the first factor and once in the second factor, so a total multiplicity of 2.  
 – Root 5 appears once in the first factor and twice in the second factor, so a total multiplicity of 3.

Remember, the total multiplicities must add up to 8, and here they add up to 1+1+1+2+3 = 8.

I noticed in your explanation you mentioned that the multiplicity for 5 was 2 instead of 3. Could you please check your work there and clarify the multiplicities for each root based on your assignment? Let’s work on this correction step together.

What are the correct multiplicities for the roots 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 based on your assignment?
Student: Thank you for pointing that out! Let's clarify the multiplicities based on my assignment of the roots.

From my assignment:

- **First factor:** \( 1, 3, 4, 5 \)
- **Second factor:** \( 2, 4, 5, 5 \)

Now, let's count the multiplicities for each root:

1. **Root 1:** Appears once in the first factor. **Multiplicity = 1**
2. **Root 2:** Appears once in the second factor. **Multiplicity = 1**
3. **Root 3:** Appears once in the first factor. **Multiplicity = 1**
4. **Root 4:** Appears once in the first factor and once in the second factor. **Total multiplicity = 1 + 1 = 2**
5. **Root 5:** Appears once in the first factor and twice in the second factor. **Total multiplicity = 1 + 2 = 3**

So the multiplicities are:
- Root 1: 1
- Root 2: 1
- Root 3: 1
- Root 4: 2
- Root 5: 3

Adding these multiplicities gives us:
\( 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 8 \), which is correct.

Now that we've confirmed the multiplicities, we can express \( P(x) \) as:

\[
P(x) = 10 \cdot (x - 1)^1 \cdot (x - 2)^1 \cdot (x - 3)^1 \cdot (x - 4)^2 \cdot (x - 5)^3
\]

Next, we can calculate \( P(6) \) again with this correct expression:

\[
P(6) = 10 \cdot (6 - 1)^1 \cdot (6 - 2)^1 \cdot (6 - 3)^1 \cdot (6 - 4)^2 \cdot (6 - 5)^3
\]

Calculating each term:

- \( (6 - 1) = 5 \)
- \( (6 - 2) = 4 \)
- \( (6 - 3) = 3 \)
- \( (6 - 4) = 2 \) (squared gives \( 2^2 = 4 \))
- \( (6 - 5) = 1 \) (cubed gives \( 1^3 = 1 \))

Substituting these values back in:

\[
P(6) = 10 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 1
\]

Calculating step-by-step:

1. \( 5 \cdot 4 = 20 \)
2. \( 20 \cdot 3 = 60 \)
3. \( 60 \cdot 4 = 240 \)
4. \( 240 \cdot 1 = 240 \)
5. \( 10 \cdot 240 = 2400 \)

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
P(6) = 2400
\]

Thank you for your guidance! Is there anything else you'd like me to explore or clarify?
Teacher: Great job verifying the multiplicities and re‐evaluating the expression! Now, let’s move to the next step.

Step 2: Review and explain how you used the factorization to compute P(6). Please summarize your steps—how did you incorporate the leading coefficient and the multiplicities into your calculation when substituting x = 6?

Take your time to explain your reasoning for obtaining P(6) from

  P(x) = 10 · (x – 1)^1 · (x – 2)^1 · (x – 3)^1 · (x – 4)^2 · (x – 5)^3

and describe each step you used. Once you’ve written your explanation, I’ll check it and guide you further!
Student: To compute \( P(6) \) from the factorization 

\[
P(x) = 10 \cdot (x - 1)^1 \cdot (x - 2)^1 \cdot (x - 3)^1 \cdot (x - 4)^2 \cdot (x - 5)^3,
\]

I followed these steps:

1. **Substitution of \( x = 6 \):** I replaced \( x \) in the expression with 6 to evaluate \( P(6) \):
   \[
   P(6) = 10 \cdot (6 - 1)^1 \cdot (6 - 2)^1 \cdot (6 - 3)^1 \cdot (6 - 4)^2 \cdot (6 - 5)^3.
   \]

2. **Calculating each term:**
   - For \( (6 - 1)^1 \):
     \[
     6 - 1 = 5.
     \]
   - For \( (6 - 2)^1 \):
     \[
     6 - 2 = 4.
     \]
   - For \( (6 - 3)^1 \):
     \[
     6 - 3 = 3.
     \]
   - For \( (6 - 4)^2 \):
     \[
     6 - 4 = 2 \quad \text{(squared gives } 2^2 = 4\text{)}.
     \]
   - For \( (6 - 5)^3 \):
     \[
     6 - 5 = 1 \quad \text{(cubed gives } 1^3 = 1\text{)}.
     \]

3. **Combining all calculated terms:**
   Now, substituting these values back into the equation gives:
   \[
   P(6) = 10 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 1.
   \]

4. **Step-by-step multiplication:**
   I calculated the product step-by-step:
   - First, \( 5 \cdot 4 = 20 \).
   - Then, \( 20 \cdot 3 = 60 \).
   - Next, \( 60 \cdot 4 = 240 \).
   - Finally, \( 240 \cdot 1 = 240 \).
   - Lastly, multiplying by the leading coefficient \( 10 \):
   \[
   10 \cdot 240 = 2400.
   \]

Thus, the final result for \( P(6) \) is 

\[
P(6) = 2400.
\]

This systematic approach ensured that I correctly computed \( P(6) \) while respecting the multiplicities of the roots and the leading coefficient. Thank you for your guidance! Is there anything else you would like me to clarify or review?
Teacher: That was an excellent explanation of how you substituted and combined the factors to compute P(6)! You carefully broke down the expression into:

 1. Substituting x = 6 for each factor.
 2. Computing (6 – 1), (6 – 2), (6 – 3), (6 – 4)², and (6 – 5)³.
 3. Multiplying these values by the leading coefficient 10.

Before we move on, could you please walk me through the multiplication step-by-step? For example, show how 5 · 4 · 3 · 4 multiplies together and then how multiplying by 10 gives you the final product. Once you've done that, we'll review your calculation together.
Student: Sure! Let's break down the multiplication step-by-step for the expression:

\[
P(6) = 10 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 1.
\]

1. **Start with the first two factors:**
   \[
   5 \cdot 4 = 20.
   \]

2. **Now take that result and multiply by the next factor (3):**
   \[
   20 \cdot 3 = 60.
   \]

3. **Next, multiply that result by the next factor (4):**
   \[
   60 \cdot 4 = 240.
   \]

4. **Finally, we multiply by 1 (which does not change the value):**
   \[
   240 \cdot 1 = 240.
   \]

5. **Now, we multiply this result by the leading coefficient (10):**
   \[
   10 \cdot 240 = 2400.
   \]

So, the final result for \( P(6) \) is:

\[
P(6) = 2400.
\]

This step-by-step multiplication confirms that I accurately calculated the product. Thank you for your guidance! Is there anything else you would like to discuss or clarify?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've carefully broken down every step, from assigning the roots to computing the final product step-by-step. You correctly determined that

  P(6) = 10 · 5 · 4 · 3 · 4 · 1 = 2400.

Your detailed explanation shows that you've incorporated the leading coefficient and each multiplicative term correctly. 

Final Answer: 2400$
