Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'R4bk1/3prp1p/1Q6/1pP2ppN/1q1P4/4P1P1/5P1P/6K1 b - - 1 29'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning move is e7e3. 

To explain briefly: Black’s rook on e7 can swing into action with Rxe3. If White recaptures with the queen (Qxe3)—which is forced to avoid immediate mate—then Black has the beautiful follow‐up Qxg2#, where the white king on g1 has no escape squares. This tactical “deflection” sacrifice wins by forcing mate. 

Thus, the best move for Black is: e7e3.
