Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'R4bk1/3prp1p/1Q6/1pP2ppN/1q1P4/4P1P1/5P1P/6K1 b - - 1 29'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The best move is b4c5. 

To explain briefly without giving away too much internal calculation: Black’s queen on b4 can immediately capture White’s pawn on c5 along the b4–c5 diagonal. This not only wins material (or forces an exchange that eases the pressure) but also eliminates one of White’s key central pawns and dissolves some of the attacking potential behind White’s active queen. Detailed engine‐analysis indicates that 29…Qxc5 leaves Black with a favorable position.

Thus, the move is: b4c5.
