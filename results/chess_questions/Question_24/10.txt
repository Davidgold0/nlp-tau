Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'r4rk1/ppp2p1p/2np1p2/2b1p3/4P1b1/2PP1N2/PP3P1P/RN2KBR1 b Q - 1 10'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: After analyzing the position, the move that gives Black the best counter‐play is to centralize the knight with a fork threat. The move is to send the knight from c6 to d4, which not only places the knight centrally but also creates immediate tactical ideas (for example, the threat of Nc2+ against White’s rook on a1). 

Thus, the best move is:

c6d4
