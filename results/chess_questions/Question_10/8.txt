Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '5rk1/6pn/Q6p/1p2R3/8/5N2/1q3PPP/6K1 b - - 0 26'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The move is b2d4. 

This move immediately creates a lethal threat (for example, after Qd4 Black menaces Qxf2#, which forces White to come up with a very awkward defence). A detailed engine‐analysis confirms that after 1…Qd4 White’s replies fail to stop the mating threats without severe loss of material.
