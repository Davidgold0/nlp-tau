Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '5rk1/6pn/Q6p/1p2R3/8/5N2/1q3PPP/6K1 b - - 0 26'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning move is  b2g2 – that is, Black’s queen takes the pawn on g2 with check. 

To explain briefly (without giving an entire line‐by‐line analysis): the key tactical resource in this position is that the Black queen on b2 can immediately capture on g2. After 1...Qxg2+ the white king’s replies fall into a forced mating net. For example, if 2.Kf1 then Black has the crushing 2...Qxf2#; if instead 2.Kh1, Black’s follow‐up (for example via a move like …Qh2+ and subsequent force) leads to immediate mate. In short, none of White’s responses can escape the coming mate. 

Thus the best move for Black is  b2g2.
