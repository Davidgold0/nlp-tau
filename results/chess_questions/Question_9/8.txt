Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '1r2r1k1/5pp1/p6Q/2p1q3/4p3/1P4R1/P1P2PPP/4R1K1 b - - 2 30'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning move is e5h2. 

To explain briefly without exhaustive analysis: Black has an overwhelming tactical resource by giving a forcing check with the queen. After the move 30...e5h2+, White’s king is forced to move and Black’s follow‐up leads to mate. Engine analysis confirms that Qh2+ (i.e. moving the queen from e5 to h2) is best. 

Thus, the single–move answer in the required notation is: e5h2
