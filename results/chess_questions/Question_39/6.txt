Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'r5k1/pp5p/n3r3/5QP1/2p5/7P/PP6/2K2n2 w - - 0 36'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning move for White is f5e6. 

In this position Whiteâ€™s queen on f5 can take the black rook on e6 with a diagonal move. Since the rook on e6 is unguarded, the move Qxe6 wins significant material and leaves Black with no satisfactory response. Therefore, the best move is:

f5e6
