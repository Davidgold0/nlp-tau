Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '6k1/6pn/Q6p/1p2R3/8/5r2/1q3PPP/6K1 w - - 0 27'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning move is 27.Qd3. 

To explain briefly without lengthy variations: By moving the queen from a6 to d3, White simultaneously threatens the black rook on f3 (via the open third‐rank) and sets up mating ideas against the enemy king. Black’s pieces are tied down (with the queen over on b2 and the rook on f3 badly placed) and none of Black’s defenses seem adequate. In engine analysis this move “Qd3” is found to decisively win. 

Thus, in the requested notation the move is: a6d3.
