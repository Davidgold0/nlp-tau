Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '8/5k2/p2pNqpr/2pPp3/2P1B3/4P3/PP2KR2/8 b - - 5 46'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The move is f6f3. 

To explain briefly without giving away all the engine‐details: Black’s queen can swing to f3 along a clear file (with the proper clearing on f5 and f4) so that it immediately threatens decisive infiltration – notably, a mate threat on the back‐rank (especially involving the pressure on the f2–square). In this position the move …Qf3 poses such immediate problems that white cannot adequately meet all the threats. After 46…Qf3, white’s defensive resources are overwhelmed, and Black comes out with a winning advantage. 

So the best move is: f6f3.
