Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '8/5k2/p2pNqpr/2pPp3/2P1B3/4P3/PP2KR2/8 b - - 5 46'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The best move is f6h4.

To explain briefly without revealing all internal calculations: in this tactically charged position Black’s queen on f6 can step to h4 via the diagonal (the route f6–g5–h4 is clear) so that it sets up an immediate mating threat (in many lines Qxh2 becomes deadly). In concrete analysis this move forces White into difficult defensive resources and wins material or mating chances.

Thus, the move is f6h4.
