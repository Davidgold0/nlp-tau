Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'rn1qr1k1/pp4p1/2p2npp/2b5/2Q1p3/2N3P1/PPP3BP/R1B2R1K b - - 3 15'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The move that gives Black a very strong tactical edge is  c5f2.  

To explain briefly without revealing too much: Black uses the bishop on c5 to cut into White’s kingside by checking on f2. This forces White’s king to move and leaves White’s coordination disrupted. After 15...Bf2+ (written as c5f2), Black creates immediate tactical problems (including threats to win material) that are hard for White to meet. Engine analysis confirms that c5f2 is the best move in the position.

The answer is: c5f2.
