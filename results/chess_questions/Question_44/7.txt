Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '4R1k1/6pn/Q6p/1p6/8/5r2/1q3PPP/6K1 b - - 1 27'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning move is h7f6. 

Looking briefly at the position, Black’s knight on h7 is surprisingly passive – until it jumps to f6, where it immediately attacks the undefended white rook sitting on e8. Since the white queen on a6 isn’t helping to protect e8, this knight jump wins the exchange. In other words, after 27...h7f6 the white rook on e8 is lost, giving Black a decisive material and positional advantage.

Thus, the best move for Black is: h7f6.
