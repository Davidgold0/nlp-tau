Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'r2Q1k1r/1b2ppbp/pp4pq/8/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2R2K1 b - - 5 18'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning move is a8d8. 

Here's the idea in brief: White’s queen sits deep on d8, defended only by the rook on d1. Black can immediately capture on d8 with the a8–rook. After 18...a8d8 the white queen cannot simply escape; if White recaptures with 19.Rxd8 then Black has exchanged a rook (value ≈5) for a queen (value ≈9) – netting a decisive material advantage. No other move saves the queen, so this capture wins material for Black. 

Thus, the best move for Black is: a8d8.
