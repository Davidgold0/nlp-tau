Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '8/pp3pk1/6p1/3PN2r/7Q/3B2K1/PP6/8 b - - 0 36'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning move is h5f5. 

After 36...h5f5, Black’s rook immediately attacks the white knight on e5. White has no satisfactory way to both meet this threat and counter Black’s resources. Detailed analysis shows that after 36...h5f5 any retreat or defense of the knight loses material or leaves critical weaknesses, which ultimately gives Black a strong advantage.

Thus, the best move for Black is: h5f5.
