Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '8/pp2Qpk1/6p1/3PN2r/7q/3B2K1/PP6/8 w - - 1 36'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The move is e7f7. 

To explain briefly without giving away too many details: White’s queen on e7 can capture on f7. Although f7 is occupied by a black pawn, the capture comes with a check and has the added tactical resource that after the king moves, White has decisive follow‐ups. In the computer–analysis of this position, Qxf7+ forces responses that lead to mate (or overwhelming material gain), and it is evaluated as the best move. 

Thus, the best move is: e7f7.
