Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '1r2r1k1/5pp1/p6Q/2p5/4p3/1P4q1/P1P2PPP/4R1K1 w - - 0 31'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning move is e1e8. 

After 31. e1e8+, White’s rook invades the eighth rank (capturing the black rook on e8) and delivers a forcing check. In all of Black’s responses the mate is inevitable, for example after 31…Rxe8 32. Qg7# delivers mate. 

Thus, the best move for White is e1e8.
