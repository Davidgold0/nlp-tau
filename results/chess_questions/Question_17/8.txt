Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'b1r5/5p1k/4p1p1/4P2p/R2PP3/R1P1b1QP/5NPK/N3q3 b - - 8 41'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning tactical shot is to check with the queen by 41…e1→g1+. This forces the white king to move so that afterward the f2‐knight can be captured. In other words, 41...Qe1g1+ wins material and is best for Black.

So the answer is: e1g1
