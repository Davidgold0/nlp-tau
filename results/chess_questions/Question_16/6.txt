Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'rn1qr1k1/pp4p1/2p2npp/2b5/4p3/2N3P1/PPP1Q1BP/R1B2R1K w - - 2 15'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: After careful analysis, the move that gives White strong tactical chances is to activate the knight with the capture on e4. The idea is that after

  15. Nc3–e4

if Black recaptures immediately (for example, 15…Nxe4), then White can reply with

  16. Qxe4

which not only recovers the piece but also targets Black’s rook on e8 along the open e‐file. This tactic creates dual threats and forces Black into an awkward defensive stance.

Thus, the best move for White is:

c3e4
