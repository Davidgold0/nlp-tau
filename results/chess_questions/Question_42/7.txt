Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '6r1/1P5p/3bp3/8/3k4/2R2K2/7P/3N4 w - - 1 45'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning idea is not to rush promoting the b‐pawn (since b7b8=Q or b7b8=R would immediately be captured along the 8th rank by Black’s rook on g8) but first to bring the rook over so that when promotion occurs the new piece is “protected” by the rook. In this position the strongest move is to swing the rook from c3 to c8. Then, for example, after

  45. Rc3c8

the b‐pawn can safely promote on b8 because any recapture (by Black’s rook or even Black’s bishop from d6) will be answered by Rxb8. Thus the best single move for White is

  c3c8.
