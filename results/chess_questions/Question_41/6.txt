Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'r4r1k/ppp2p1p/2np1p2/2b1p3/4P1b1/2PP1N2/PP3P1P/RN2KBR1 w Q - 2 11'.

  f1g2

the bishop comes to an active diagonal while covering f3, and White can continue development (and later castle queenside) without having to worry about Black’s bishop on g4 harassing that knight.
