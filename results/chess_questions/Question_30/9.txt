Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '1r3rk1/6p1/3p3p/3P4/3Q1p2/7P/4nPP1/R4RK1 w - - 1 29'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: After careful analysis, the move that most refutes Black’s active knight on e2 and leaves White with a clear advantage is to reposition the queen so that it eyes the intruder and forces decisive concessions. The winning line begins with

  Qd4→f2

This move (written “d4f2”) puts immediate pressure on the knight on e2. Its available retreats all run into tactical problems – some of which will lose material—and it brings White’s forces into an even more dominant posture. 

Thus, the best move for White is:

  d4f2
