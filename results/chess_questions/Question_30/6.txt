Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '1r3rk1/6p1/3p3p/3P4/3Q1p2/7P/4nPP1/R4RK1 w - - 1 29'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: I recommend the move d4e5.

Let me explain briefly. Although White’s queen is on d4, it is “blocked” from moving straight up by its own pawn on d5. However, one of its many diagonals – toward the upper‐right – puts it on e5. On e5 the queen sits very actively: it eyes down the entire e–file (with the intermediate squares e4 and e3 being clear) so that the black knight sitting on e2 becomes directly attacked. In most variations the knight on e2 cannot easily be defended or escape without creating further problems for Black, so Qe5 wins material or forces Black into a very passive defense.

Thus the best move for White is: d4e5.
