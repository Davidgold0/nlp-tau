Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '1k5r/ppp2p1R/8/8/4q1P1/P7/1P2P3/K2Q1B2 b - - 1 25'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The engine’s analysis shows that the winning breakthrough for Black is to capture the white rook on h7. In the given position the move

  e4h7

is best. 

Explanation (briefly): Black’s queen on e4 can travel the clear diagonal to h7 and capture White’s rook. This capture wins decisive material and leaves White without sufficient compensation.

Thus, the best move for Black is e4h7.
