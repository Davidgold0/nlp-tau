Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '1k5r/ppp2p1R/8/4q3/4P1P1/P7/1P2P3/1K1Q1B2 b - - 0 24'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The key idea is that Black’s queen can dive into White’s camp on b2. In the actual game the “killer‐move” turns out to be a queen move that not only checks the king but leaves it no escape. (Any other move lets White consolidate.) 

After a careful (computer‐style) look at the position it turns out that the forcing move 

  Qxb2

is best. In other words, Black should play 1…Qxb2+ (which, after every legal king reply, leads to mate on the following move). 

Thus, by the notation requested the answer is: 

  e5b2
