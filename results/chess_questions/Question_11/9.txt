Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '1k5r/ppp2p1R/8/4q3/4P1P1/P7/1P2P3/1K1Q1B2 b - - 0 24'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The correct move is h8h7. 

After carefully reviewing the position,Blackâ€™s rook on h8 may capture the white rook sitting on h7. White does not have any piece defending that rook, and no immediate recapturing resource is available. (While there are other moves, nothing beats winning the exchange by capturing the white rook without any compensation.) 

Thus the best move for Black is: h8h7.
