Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '1k5r/ppp2p1R/8/4q3/4P1P1/P7/1P2P3/1K1Q1B2 b - - 0 24'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning move for Black is h8h7. 

Let's briefly explain: In the given FEN, White’s rook on h7 sits deep in enemy territory without proper support. Black’s rook on h8 can immediately capture it by playing h8h7. This move wins material outright, and there is no adequate compensation for White. 

Thus, the best move for Black is:

h8h7
