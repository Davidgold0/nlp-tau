Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'R4bk1/3prp1p/1Q6/1pP2ppN/3P4/4P1P1/5P1P/1q4K1 w - - 2 30'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning move is b6d8. 

To explain briefly without giving away every detail: by moving the queen from b6 to d8, White prepares a deadly mate threat (namely Qxf8# on the next move) that Black cannot parry. The key is that on d8 the queen “joins forces” with the rook on a8 along the 8th rank; after the forced reply Black’s defenses collapse. This tactical shot wins immediately. 

Thus, the best move for White is: b6d8.
