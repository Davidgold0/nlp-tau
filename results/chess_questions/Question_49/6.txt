Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '8/pp3pk1/6p1/3PN3/7r/3B2K1/PP6/8 w - - 0 37'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: I'll choose the move d5–d6.

This pawn‐push advances White’s passed pawn into a forward post that, aside from its own potential, clears lines for the bishop and increases White’s activity. In analysis the move “d5d6” turns out to be White’s most challenging reply in this position.
