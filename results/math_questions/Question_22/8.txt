Question: Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $1.2n-4.4<5.2$.
3o-mini: To solve the inequality 1.2n - 4.4 < 5.2, follow these steps:

1. Add 4.4 to both sides:
  1.2n < 5.2 + 4.4  
  1.2n < 9.6

2. Divide both sides by 1.2:
  n < 9.6 / 1.2  
  n < 8

Since n must be a positive integer, n can be any of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. The sum of these integers is:

  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28

Thus, the sum of all positive integers n satisfying the inequality is 28.
