Question: Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $1.2n-4.4<5.2$.
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem. We need to find all positive integers n that satisfy the inequality 1.2n – 4.4 < 5.2, and then sum those integers.

Let’s outline the steps we would take to solve this:

1. Isolate the term with n in the inequality by adding 4.4 to both sides.
2. Solve for n by dividing by 1.2.
3. Determine which positive integers satisfy the inequality (keeping in mind n must be a positive integer).
4. Sum all the valid integers.

Now, can you start by working on the first step: What do you get when you add 4.4 to both sides of the inequality 1.2n – 4.4 < 5.2? Please show your work on this step.
Student: Sure! Let's start by adding 4.4 to both sides of the inequality:

The original inequality is:
\[ 1.2n - 4.4 < 5.2 \]

When we add 4.4 to both sides, we get:
\[ 1.2n - 4.4 + 4.4 < 5.2 + 4.4 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 1.2n < 9.6 \]

So, after this step, we have the inequality:
\[ 1.2n < 9.6 \]

What should I do next?
Teacher: Great work isolating the term with n! Now, for the next step, we need to isolate n completely. Can you divide both sides of the inequality 1.2n < 9.6 by 1.2 and show your work on that step?
Student: Student: Sure! Now, let's divide both sides of the inequality \( 1.2n < 9.6 \) by \( 1.2 \):

\[
\frac{1.2n}{1.2} < \frac{9.6}{1.2}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
n < 8
\]

So now we have the inequality:

\[
n < 8
\]

What should I do next?
Teacher: Excellent job so far! You've found that n must be less than 8. 

Now for the next step: Since n is a positive integer, which values of n satisfy n < 8? Please list them and then show your work on finding their sum.
Student: Sure! Since \( n \) is a positive integer and must be less than 8, the possible values of \( n \) are:

\[
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
\]

Now, let's find the sum of these integers. We can calculate the sum as follows:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7
\]

Using the formula for the sum of the first \( k \) positive integers, which is given by \( \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \), we can substitute \( k = 7 \):

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{7(7 + 1)}{2} = \frac{7 \times 8}{2} = \frac{56}{2} = 28
\]

Therefore, the sum of all positive integers \( n \) such that \( n < 8 \) is:

\[
\boxed{28}
\] 

Is there anything else you would like me to clarify or expand upon?
Teacher: You've worked through the problem really well! You've isolated n by adding 4.4 to both sides, divided by 1.2, and determined that n < 8 for positive integers. Then you correctly identified the possible positive integers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) and found their sum using both direct addition and the formula. 

Great job on every step! The final answer is: 28$
