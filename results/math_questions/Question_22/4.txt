Question: Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $1.2n-4.4<5.2$.
Teacher: Let's start by breaking the problem into manageable steps. We need to find the sum of all positive integers n that satisfy the inequality 1.2n – 4.4 < 5.2. Here’s an outline of the approach:

1. Solve the inequality 1.2n – 4.4 < 5.2 for n.
2. Once you have the inequality in terms of n, determine which positive integers satisfy it.
3. Finally, sum those integers.

Let's begin with the first step. Could you please add 4.4 to both sides of the inequality 1.2n – 4.4 < 5.2 and tell me what the new inequality becomes?
Student: Sure! If we add 4.4 to both sides of the inequality \( 1.2n - 4.4 < 5.2 \), we get:

\[
1.2n - 4.4 + 4.4 < 5.2 + 4.4
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
1.2n < 9.6
\]

Is that correct?
Teacher: That's correct—the inequality simplifies to 1.2n < 9.6. 

Now, please move on to the next step: divide both sides of 1.2n < 9.6 by 1.2 to solve for n. What inequality do you get for n?
Student: Student: Okay! If we divide both sides of the inequality \( 1.2n < 9.6 \) by \( 1.2 \), we get:

\[
n < \frac{9.6}{1.2}
\]

Calculating the right side, \( \frac{9.6}{1.2} = 8 \). 

So the inequality simplifies to:

\[
n < 8
\]

Is that correct?
Teacher: You're on the right track! Now that we have n < 8 and we know n must be a positive integer, please list out all positive integers that satisfy this inequality. Once you have that list, can you determine the sum of those integers?
Student: Sure! The positive integers that satisfy the inequality \( n < 8 \) are:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

Now, let's sum these integers:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28.
\]

So, the sum of all positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the inequality is \( 28 \).
Teacher: Great job working through the problem! To summarize our process:

1. We started with the inequality 1.2n - 4.4 < 5.2.  
2. By adding 4.4 to both sides, we obtained 1.2n < 9.6.  
3. Dividing both sides by 1.2 gave us n < 8.  
4. Since n is a positive integer, the list of valid values was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.  
5. Finally, summing these integers gave us 28.

Thus, the sum of all positive integers n satisfying the inequality is 28$
