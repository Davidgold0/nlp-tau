Question: Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $1.2n-4.4<5.2$.
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem step by step. We need to find the sum of all positive integers n for which 1.2n – 4.4 < 5.2. 

Here’s a high-level plan:
1. Begin by isolating the variable n in the inequality.
2. Add 4.4 to both sides to simplify the inequality.
3. Divide by 1.2 to solve for n.
4. Identify which positive integer values satisfy the inequality.
5. Sum those integers.

Let’s work on the first step together.

Step 1: Isolate n by getting rid of the -4.4. What do you get when you add 4.4 to both sides of the inequality 1.2n – 4.4 < 5.2? Please show your work for this step.
Student: Sure! Let's start with the inequality:

\[ 1.2n - 4.4 < 5.2. \]

Now, I will add 4.4 to both sides:

\[ 1.2n - 4.4 + 4.4 < 5.2 + 4.4. \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 1.2n < 9.6. \]

So, after this step, we have:

\[ 1.2n < 9.6. \]

Is that correct? What should I do next?
Teacher: Good work! You've correctly added 4.4 to both sides to get 1.2n < 9.6.

Now, let's move on to the next step: dividing both sides by 1.2 to isolate n. Could you please solve for n by dividing both sides of the inequality by 1.2? Remember to show your work and explain what the resulting inequality looks like.
Student: Sure! Starting from the inequality we have:

\[ 1.2n < 9.6. \]

Now, I will divide both sides by 1.2:

\[ \frac{1.2n}{1.2} < \frac{9.6}{1.2}. \]

This simplifies to:

\[ n < 8. \]

So, after this step, we have:

\[ n < 8. \]

Is that correct? What should I do next?
Teacher: You're doing great! Your work so far is correct.

Now, let's move on to the next step: Identify which positive integers satisfy the inequality n < 8. What positive integer values of n would work here? Please list them, and remember to include only the positive integers.
Student: Student: Thank you! Since we have the inequality \( n < 8 \), we need to identify the positive integers that are less than 8. 

The positive integers less than 8 are:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

So, the positive integer values of \( n \) that satisfy the inequality \( n < 8 \) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. 

What should I do next?
Teacher: Great job listing all the positive integers that satisfy n < 8. Now, for the final step, we need to sum these integers. 

Step 4: Calculate the sum of the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Can you show the calculation for the sum of these integers? Please provide your work.
Student: Sure! To find the sum of the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, I will add them together step by step:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7.
\]

Let's break it down:

1. First, I can pair the numbers for easier addition:
   - \(1 + 7 = 8\)
   - \(2 + 6 = 8\)
   - \(3 + 5 = 8\)

2. This leaves us with:
   - \(8 + 8 + 4 = 20\)

So, the total sum is:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28.
\]

Therefore, the sum of all positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the inequality is \( 28 \). Is that correct?
Teacher: Excellent work! You correctly summed the numbers to get 28. To review:  

1. You isolated n by adding 4.4, getting 1.2n < 9.6.  
2. Then you divided both sides by 1.2 to obtain n < 8.  
3. You listed the positive integers less than 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.  
4. Finally, you summed these integers to get 28.

Your process is entirely correct. The final answer is 28$
