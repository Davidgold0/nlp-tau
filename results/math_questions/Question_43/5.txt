Question: One of the following four-digit numbers is not divisible by 4: 3544, 3554, 3564, 3572, 3576. What is the product of the units digit and the tens digit of that number?
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem in our own words: We have several four-digit numbers, and we need to find the one number that is not divisible by 4. Then, once we find that particular number, we have to calculate the product of its tens digit and its units digit.

A key point to remember is the rule for divisibility by 4: a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits (the tens and units digits) form a number that is divisible by 4.

Step 1: Apply the divisibility rule for 4 to one of the numbers. Let's start with the first number, 3544. Can you explain how you would use the last two digits of 3544 to check whether it is divisible by 4? What calculation would you perform with those two digits?
Student: To check if the number 3544 is divisible by 4, I will look at the last two digits, which are 44. According to the rule for divisibility by 4, I need to see if 44 is divisible by 4.

To do this, I can perform the calculation: 

44 ÷ 4 = 11

Since 11 is a whole number, this means that 44 is divisible by 4. Therefore, the number 3544 is also divisible by 4. 

Would you like me to check the next number now?
Teacher: Great job! Your explanation for 3544 is clear and correct—you correctly checked that 44 is divisible by 4. 

Now, let's move on to the next number, 3554. Using the same rule, can you identify the last two digits of 3554 and then check if that two-digit number is divisible by 4? Please share your reasoning for this step.
Student: Student: The last two digits of the number 3554 are 54. To check if 3554 is divisible by 4, I need to see if 54 is divisible by 4.

I can perform the calculation:

54 ÷ 4 = 13.5

Since 13.5 is not a whole number, this means that 54 is not divisible by 4. Therefore, the number 3554 is not divisible by 4.

Should I continue checking the other numbers to confirm which one is not divisible by 4?
Teacher: Great work checking 3554! You've correctly identified that its last two digits (54) are not divisible by 4, meaning 3554 is the number we're interested in.

Now, let's move to the next step: We need to find the product of the tens digit and the units digit of 3554. 

First, could you please identify which digits are the tens digit and the units digit in 3554 and explain how you'll calculate their product?
Student: Student: In the number 3554, the tens digit is 5 and the units digit is 4. To find the product of these two digits, I will multiply them together.

So, the calculation will be:

5 (tens digit) × 4 (units digit) = 20

Therefore, the product of the tens digit and the units digit of the number 3554 is 20. 

Is there anything else you would like me to do?
Teacher: Excellent work! You correctly identified that 3554 is the number that isn’t divisible by 4—and that its last two digits, 54, confirm this. You also correctly determined that in 3554 the tens digit is 5 and the units digit is 4, and multiplying these gives 20.

To summarize, you applied the divisibility rule accurately, tested each number methodically, and then computed the product of the required digits correctly.
