Question: One of the following four-digit numbers is not divisible by 4: 3544, 3554, 3564, 3572, 3576. What is the product of the units digit and the tens digit of that number?
3o-mini: To check if a number is divisible by 4, we only need to look at its last two digits. Here's the process for each number:

• 3544: Last two digits are 44, and 44 ÷ 4 = 11 (divisible by 4).
• 3554: Last two digits are 54, and 54 ÷ 4 = 13.5 (not divisible by 4).
• 3564: Last two digits are 64, and 64 ÷ 4 = 16 (divisible by 4).
• 3572: Last two digits are 72, and 72 ÷ 4 = 18 (divisible by 4).
• 3576: Last two digits are 76, and 76 ÷ 4 = 19 (divisible by 4).

Therefore, 3554 is the number that is not divisible by 4.

Now, identify the tens and units digits of 3554:
• Tens digit = 5
• Units digit = 4

The product of these digits is 5 × 4 = 20.
