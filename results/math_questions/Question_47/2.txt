Question: What is the average of all positive integers that have three digits when written in base $5$, but two digits when written in base $8$? Write your answer in base $10$.
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem. We need to find all positive integers that meet two conditions:
1. When written in base 5, the number has three digits.
2. When written in base 8, the number has two digits.

To begin, let’s translate each condition into a range for the number (in base 10).

Step 1: Find the range of numbers that have exactly three digits in base 5. 

Remember that a three-digit number in base 5 starts at 5² (since the smallest three-digit number is 100 in base 5) and goes up to 5³ – 1 (since the maximum three-digit number in any base is when all digits are the largest possible).

Please calculate:
a. The smallest number (in base 10) that is represented as a three-digit number in base 5.
b. The largest number (in base 10) that is represented as a three-digit number in base 5.

What do you get for these two numbers?
Student: To find the range of numbers that have exactly three digits in base 5, we can follow the teacher's guidance and calculate the smallest and largest numbers represented as three-digit numbers in base 5.

**Step 1: Calculate the smallest number in base 10 that is a three-digit number in base 5.**

The smallest three-digit number in base 5 is \(100_5\). To convert this to base 10, we can use the positional values:

\[
100_5 = 1 \cdot 5^2 + 0 \cdot 5^1 + 0 \cdot 5^0 = 1 \cdot 25 + 0 + 0 = 25
\]

So, the smallest number that has three digits in base 5 is **25** in base 10.

**Step 2: Calculate the largest number in base 10 that is a three-digit number in base 5.**

The largest three-digit number in base 5 is \(444_5\). To convert this to base 10, we can again use the positional values:

\[
444_5 = 4 \cdot 5^2 + 4 \cdot 5^1 + 4 \cdot 5^0 = 4 \cdot 25 + 4 \cdot 5 + 4 \cdot 1 = 100 + 20 + 4 = 124
\]

So, the largest number that has three digits in base 5 is **124** in base 10.

**Summary of Step 1:**
- Smallest number (three digits in base 5): **25**
- Largest number (three digits in base 5): **124**

Now, I have found the range of numbers that have three digits in base 5. What should I do next?
Teacher: Great job on finding the three-digit range in base 5! Now, let's move on to the next part of the problem.

Step 2: We need the range of numbers that have exactly two digits when written in base 8. In any base, the smallest two-digit number is represented as "10" in that base, and the largest two-digit number is represented with both digits at their maximum value.

Please calculate:
a. The smallest number (in base 10) represented as a two-digit number in base 8.
b. The largest number (in base 10) represented as a two-digit number in base 8.

Take your time to work on this step and let me know your results.
Student: To find the range of numbers that have exactly two digits in base 8, I will follow the teacher's guidance and calculate the smallest and largest numbers represented as two-digit numbers in base 8.

**Step 2: Calculate the smallest number in base 10 that is a two-digit number in base 8.**

The smallest two-digit number in base 8 is \(10_8\). To convert this to base 10, we can use the positional values:

\[
10_8 = 1 \cdot 8^1 + 0 \cdot 8^0 = 1 \cdot 8 + 0 = 8
\]

So, the smallest number that has two digits in base 8 is **8** in base 10.

**Step 2: Calculate the largest number in base 10 that is a two-digit number in base 8.**

The largest two-digit number in base 8 is \(77_8\). To convert this to base 10, we can again use the positional values:

\[
77_8 = 7 \cdot 8^1 + 7 \cdot 8^0 = 7 \cdot 8 + 7 \cdot 1 = 56 + 7 = 63
\]

So, the largest number that has two digits in base 8 is **63** in base 10.

**Summary of Step 2:**
- Smallest number (two digits in base 8): **8**
- Largest number (two digits in base 8): **63**

Now that I have found the range of numbers that have two digits in base 8, what should I do next?
Teacher: Great work on finding the two-digit range in base 8!

Now for Step 3, let's determine the set of numbers that satisfy both conditions. We have two ranges to consider:

• For three digits in base 5, the numbers are from 25 to 124 (inclusive in base 10).  
• For two digits in base 8, the numbers are from 8 to 63 (inclusive in base 10).

a. Could you determine the intersection of these two ranges? In other words, what is the range of numbers that is common to both conditions?

Please state the smallest and largest numbers in this intersection.
Student: To find the intersection of the two ranges we have established:

1. The range for three-digit numbers in base 5 is from **25 to 124** (inclusive).
2. The range for two-digit numbers in base 8 is from **8 to 63** (inclusive).

Now, let's determine the overlap between these two ranges:

- The smallest number in the intersection must be the maximum of the two lower bounds:  
  \[
  \text{max}(25, 8) = 25
  \]

- The largest number in the intersection must be the minimum of the two upper bounds:  
  \[
  \text{min}(124, 63) = 63
  \]

Thus, the intersection of the two ranges is from **25 to 63** (inclusive).

**Summary of Step 3:**
- Smallest number in the intersection: **25**
- Largest number in the intersection: **63**

What should I do next?
Teacher: Great job finding the intersection range! Now we have the numbers from 25 to 63 (inclusive) that satisfy both conditions.

Step 4: Next, we need to compute the average of these numbers. Since the numbers form a consecutive sequence (an arithmetic sequence), one method is to use the formula for the average of an arithmetic sequence, which is:

  Average = (First number + Last number) ÷ 2

Using our intersection range:
  First number = 25
  Last number = 63

Please calculate the average using this formula, and let me know what you get for the average.
Student: To calculate the average of the numbers from 25 to 63 (inclusive), I will use the formula for the average of an arithmetic sequence:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{First number} + \text{Last number}}{2}
\]

Substituting in our values:

- First number = 25
- Last number = 63

Now, let's calculate:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{25 + 63}{2} = \frac{88}{2} = 44
\]

So, the average of all positive integers that have three digits when written in base 5 but two digits when written in base 8 is **44** in base 10.

Is there anything else you would like me to do with this information?
Teacher: Excellent work! Let's quickly review the steps we followed:

1. We determined that three-digit numbers in base 5 range from 100₅ (which is 25 in base 10) to 444₅ (which is 124 in base 10).
2. We found that two-digit numbers in base 8 range from 10₈ (which is 8 in base 10) to 77₈ (which is 63 in base 10).
3. By finding the intersection of these two ranges, we discovered that the numbers from 25 to 63 (inclusive) satisfy both conditions.
4. Finally, using the arithmetic sequence average formula (first number + last number divided by 2), we computed the average as (25 + 63)/2 = 44.

So, the final answer is 44$
