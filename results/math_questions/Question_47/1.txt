Question: What is the average of all positive integers that have three digits when written in base $5$, but two digits when written in base $8$? Write your answer in base $10$.
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem into steps. We’re asked to find the average of all positive integers that, when written in base 5, have three digits and, when written in base 8, have two digits. 

Step 1: Determine the range of numbers that have three digits in base 5. This means figuring out what the smallest and the largest three-digit numbers in base 5 are, and then converting those to base 10.

What is the smallest three-digit number in base 5, and what is the largest? Please convert both of these numbers to their base‑10 equivalents as your next step.
Student: To find the smallest and largest three-digit numbers in base 5, we first need to understand what a three-digit number in base 5 looks like. A three-digit number in base 5 can be represented as \(abc_5\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are digits from 0 to 4, and \(a\) cannot be 0 (since it’s the leading digit).

**Step 1: Smallest three-digit number in base 5**

The smallest three-digit number in base 5 is \(100_5\). To convert \(100_5\) to base 10, we calculate:

\[
100_5 = 1 \cdot 5^2 + 0 \cdot 5^1 + 0 \cdot 5^0 = 1 \cdot 25 + 0 + 0 = 25
\]

So, the smallest three-digit number in base 5 is \(25\) in base 10.

**Step 2: Largest three-digit number in base 5**

The largest three-digit number in base 5 is \(444_5\). To convert \(444_5\) to base 10, we calculate:

\[
444_5 = 4 \cdot 5^2 + 4 \cdot 5^1 + 4 \cdot 5^0 = 4 \cdot 25 + 4 \cdot 5 + 4 \cdot 1 = 100 + 20 + 4 = 124
\]

So, the largest three-digit number in base 5 is \(124\) in base 10.

**Summary of Step 1:**
- Smallest three-digit number in base 5: \(25\) (base 10)
- Largest three-digit number in base 5: \(124\) (base 10)

Now, would you like me to proceed to the next step, which is determining the range of numbers that have two digits in base 8?
Teacher: Great job on step 1! You've correctly determined that the smallest three-digit number in base 5 is 25 (base 10) and the largest is 124 (base 10).

Now, let’s move on to the next step:

Step 2: Determine the range of numbers that have two digits in base 8. This involves finding the smallest two‑digit number in base 8 and the largest two‑digit number in base 8, then converting both to base 10.

Remember, in base 8, a two-digit number can be written as "ab₈" where a ≠ 0 and both digits range from 0 to 7.

Please work on this step and let me know your conversions for:
1. The smallest two‑digit number in base 8.
2. The largest two‑digit number in base 8.
Student: To find the smallest and largest two-digit numbers in base 8, we follow the same method as before.

**Step 2: Smallest two-digit number in base 8**

The smallest two-digit number in base 8 is \(10_8\). To convert \(10_8\) to base 10, we calculate:

\[
10_8 = 1 \cdot 8^1 + 0 \cdot 8^0 = 1 \cdot 8 + 0 = 8
\]

So, the smallest two-digit number in base 8 is \(8\) in base 10.

**Step 2: Largest two-digit number in base 8**

The largest two-digit number in base 8 is \(77_8\). To convert \(77_8\) to base 10, we calculate:

\[
77_8 = 7 \cdot 8^1 + 7 \cdot 8^0 = 7 \cdot 8 + 7 = 56 + 7 = 63
\]

So, the largest two-digit number in base 8 is \(63\) in base 10.

**Summary of Step 2:**
- Smallest two-digit number in base 8: \(8\) (base 10)
- Largest two-digit number in base 8: \(63\) (base 10)

Now, would you like me to proceed to the next step, which is finding the range of numbers that fall between 25 and 124 (inclusive) in base 10 and also between 8 and 63 (inclusive) in base 10?
Teacher: Great job on step 2! Your conversions for the smallest and largest two‑digit numbers in base 8 are correct.

Now let's move on to the next step:

Step 3: Find the common range of numbers that satisfy both conditions. In other words, these are the numbers that are between 25 and 124 (from the three-digit base‑5 range) and also between 8 and 63 (from the two‑digit base‑8 range).

What is the intersection (common range) of these two intervals? Please give the range in base 10.
Student: To find the common range of numbers that satisfy both conditions, we need to determine the intersection of the two intervals we have:

1. The range from the three-digit numbers in base 5 is from \(25\) to \(124\) (inclusive).
2. The range from the two-digit numbers in base 8 is from \(8\) to \(63\) (inclusive).

Now, let's find the intersection of these two ranges:

- The lower bound of the intersection will be the maximum of the lower bounds: \( \max(25, 8) = 25 \).
- The upper bound of the intersection will be the minimum of the upper bounds: \( \min(124, 63) = 63 \).

Thus, the common range of numbers that satisfy both conditions is from \(25\) to \(63\) (inclusive).

**Summary of Step 3:**
- The intersection (common range) is: \( [25, 63] \) in base 10.

Would you like me to proceed to the next step, which is finding the average of all integers within this range?
Teacher: Great job on step 3! The common range of numbers that satisfies both conditions is indeed from 25 to 63, inclusive.

Now, let’s move on to the next step:

Step 4: We need to find the average of all integers in the range from 25 to 63. To do this, you can follow these sub-steps:

a. Determine how many integers are in that range.
b. Find the sum of all these integers.
c. Then, compute the average by dividing the sum by the number of integers.

Please start with sub-step (a): How many integers are there from 25 to 63? Let me know your calculation for that.
Student: To determine how many integers are in the range from 25 to 63 (inclusive), we can use the formula for counting integers in a range. The formula is:

\[
\text{Number of integers} = \text{Upper bound} - \text{Lower bound} + 1
\]

In this case:
- The upper bound is \(63\).
- The lower bound is \(25\).

Now, we can calculate:

\[
\text{Number of integers} = 63 - 25 + 1 = 39
\]

So, there are \(39\) integers in the range from \(25\) to \(63\) (inclusive).

Would you like me to proceed to sub-step (b), which is finding the sum of all these integers?
Teacher: Excellent work on counting the numbers correctly! You found that there are 39 integers from 25 to 63, inclusive.

Now, please work on sub-step (b): Find the sum of all these integers. Remember that you can use the arithmetic series formula for the sum of consecutive integers, which is:

  Sum = (number of terms) × (first term + last term) / 2

Could you apply this formula to calculate the sum of the integers from 25 to 63? Let me know your calculation for this step.
Student: To find the sum of all integers from 25 to 63 (inclusive), we can use the arithmetic series formula you provided:

\[
\text{Sum} = \left(\text{Number of terms}\right) \times \left(\text{First term} + \text{Last term}\right) / 2
\]

From our previous step, we know:
- The number of terms is \(39\).
- The first term is \(25\).
- The last term is \(63\).

Now, let's substitute these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Sum} = 39 \times \left(25 + 63\right) / 2
\]

Calculating \(25 + 63\):

\[
25 + 63 = 88
\]

Now, substituting back into the formula:

\[
\text{Sum} = 39 \times 88 / 2
\]

Calculating \(39 \times 88\):

\[
39 \times 88 = 3432
\]

Now, dividing by \(2\):

\[
\text{Sum} = 3432 / 2 = 1716
\]

Thus, the sum of all integers from 25 to 63 is \(1716\).

Would you like me to proceed to sub-step (c), which is to compute the average by dividing the sum by the number of integers?
Teacher: Great job on sub-step (b)! You've correctly calculated that the sum of the integers from 25 to 63 is 1716.

Now, let's move on to sub-step (c): Compute the average of these integers by dividing the sum by the number of integers. Remember, the average is given by:

  Average = (Sum of integers) ÷ (Number of integers)

Given that the sum is 1716 and there are 39 integers, please calculate the average. What do you get?
Student: To find the average of the integers from 25 to 63, we will use the formula:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of integers}}{\text{Number of integers}}
\]

We know from our previous calculations:
- The sum of integers is \(1716\).
- The number of integers is \(39\).

Now, let's substitute these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{1716}{39}
\]

Now, we can perform the division:

\[
1716 \div 39 = 44
\]

Thus, the average of all positive integers that have three digits when written in base 5 and two digits when written in base 8 is \(44\) in base 10.

Would you like me to summarize the final answer?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've completed all the steps methodically. As a quick recap:

1. We determined that the range of numbers with three digits in base 5 is from 25 to 124 (in base 10).
2. Next, we found the range for two-digit numbers in base 8 to be from 8 to 63 (in base 10).
3. The intersection of these ranges is 25 to 63.
4. We then calculated there are 39 numbers in this interval, the sum is 1716, and thus the average is 1716 ÷ 39, which equals 44.

So the final answer is:
44$
