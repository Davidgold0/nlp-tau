Question: What is the average of all positive integers that have three digits when written in base $5$, but two digits when written in base $8$? Write your answer in base $10$.
3o-mini: A number has three digits in base 5 if it is at least 5² and at most 5³ – 1. That is, the number is between 25 and 124, inclusive.

A number has two digits in base 8 if it is at least 8 and at most 8² – 1, so it lies between 8 and 63, inclusive.

The numbers that satisfy both conditions are those in the intersection of the intervals [25, 124] and [8, 63]. This intersection is exactly the set of numbers from 25 to 63, inclusive.

To find the average of an arithmetic sequence, we can use the formula:
  Average = (first term + last term) / 2

For the numbers from 25 to 63:
  Average = (25 + 63) / 2 = 88 / 2 = 44

Thus, the average of all positive integers that have three digits in base 5 and two digits in base 8 is 44 in base 10.
