Question: What is the average of all positive integers that have three digits when written in base $5$, but two digits when written in base $8$? Write your answer in base $10$.
Teacher: Let’s begin by breaking this problem into clear steps. The question asks:

“What is the average of all positive integers that have three digits when written in base 5, but two digits when written in base 8? Write your answer in base 10.”

To tackle this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, determine what it means to have three digits in base 5. Find the smallest and largest numbers that have three digits in base 5, and express those endpoints in base 10.
2. Next, determine what it means to have two digits in base 8. Find the smallest and largest numbers that have two digits in base 8, and express these endpoints in base 10.
3. Find the intersection of the two ranges obtained in steps 1 and 2. This intersection gives the set of numbers that meet both conditions.
4. Finally, calculate the average of these numbers. (Since they form a consecutive list, you should be able to use the formula for the average of an arithmetic sequence.)

Let’s start with step 1:

What are the smallest and largest numbers that have three digits in base 5 when expressed in base 10? Please show your work for converting the endpoints. What do you think those endpoints are?
Student: To find the smallest and largest numbers that have three digits in base 5, we need to understand what three digits in base 5 look like.

1. **Smallest three-digit number in base 5**: 
   - The smallest three-digit number in any base is represented by the smallest digit in the highest place value. In base 5, the smallest three-digit number is \(100_5\).
   - To convert \(100_5\) to base 10, we calculate:
     \[
     1 \times 5^2 + 0 \times 5^1 + 0 \times 5^0 = 1 \times 25 + 0 + 0 = 25
     \]
   - So, the smallest three-digit number in base 5 is \(25\) in base 10.

2. **Largest three-digit number in base 5**:
   - The largest three-digit number in base 5 is represented by the largest digit in each place value. In base 5, this is \(444_5\).
   - To convert \(444_5\) to base 10, we calculate:
     \[
     4 \times 5^2 + 4 \times 5^1 + 4 \times 5^0 = 4 \times 25 + 4 \times 5 + 4 \times 1 = 100 + 20 + 4 = 124
     \]
   - Thus, the largest three-digit number in base 5 is \(124\) in base 10.

Now that we have both endpoints, the range of numbers that have three digits in base 5 is from \(25\) to \(124\) in base 10. 

What would you like me to do next? Should we move on to step 2 and find the smallest and largest numbers that have two digits in base 8?
Teacher: Great job on determining the conversion for the three-digit numbers in base 5! Your work showing that 100₅ = 25 and 444₅ = 124 in base 10 is correct.

Now, let's move on to step 2: finding the smallest and largest numbers that have two digits in base 8. 

To help you get started, consider the following:
1. What is the smallest two-digit number in any base, and how would that look in base 8?
2. Similarly, what is the largest two-digit number in base 8, and what is its base 10 value?

Please show your work for converting both numbers to base 10 and let me know what you come up with for the smallest and largest two-digit numbers in base 8.
Student: To find the smallest and largest numbers that have two digits in base 8, we can follow similar reasoning as we did for base 5.

1. **Smallest two-digit number in base 8**:
   - The smallest two-digit number in any base is represented by the smallest digit in the highest place value. In base 8, the smallest two-digit number is \(10_8\).
   - To convert \(10_8\) to base 10, we calculate:
     \[
     1 \times 8^1 + 0 \times 8^0 = 1 \times 8 + 0 = 8
     \]
   - So, the smallest two-digit number in base 8 is \(8\) in base 10.

2. **Largest two-digit number in base 8**:
   - The largest two-digit number in base 8 is represented by the largest digit in each place value. In base 8, this is \(77_8\).
   - To convert \(77_8\) to base 10, we calculate:
     \[
     7 \times 8^1 + 7 \times 8^0 = 7 \times 8 + 7 \times 1 = 56 + 7 = 63
     \]
   - Thus, the largest two-digit number in base 8 is \(63\) in base 10.

Now, we have the endpoints for the two-digit numbers in base 8: from \(8\) to \(63\) in base 10.

Should we proceed to step 3, where we find the intersection of the ranges obtained from base 5 and base 8?
Teacher: Great work on step 2! Now that we've identified the endpoints for the base 8 two-digit numbers (8 to 63 in base 10) and from your earlier work the three-digit base 5 numbers (25 to 124 in base 10), let's move on to step 3.

Step 3 is to find the intersection of these two ranges. In other words, we need to determine which numbers between 25 and 124 (from base 5 criteria) are also between 8 and 63 (from base 8 criteria).

To do this, consider:
1. Which range has the larger lower bound?
2. Which one has the smaller upper bound?

Based on your answers from the previous steps, what do you think the intersection is? Please show your reasoning and calculation for determining the intersection range.
Student: To find the intersection of the two ranges we have identified:

1. The range of numbers that have three digits in base 5 is from \(25\) to \(124\) in base 10.
2. The range of numbers that have two digits in base 8 is from \(8\) to \(63\) in base 10.

Now we need to determine the overlapping range between these two:

- The larger lower bound is \(25\) (from the base 5 range), and the smaller lower bound is \(8\) (from the base 8 range). Therefore, the lower bound of the intersection is \(25\).
- The smaller upper bound is \(63\) (from the base 8 range), and the larger upper bound is \(124\) (from the base 5 range). Therefore, the upper bound of the intersection is \(63\).

Thus, the intersection of the two ranges is from \(25\) to \(63\) in base 10.

Next, we have the range \(25\) to \(63\). Would you like me to move on to step 4 and calculate the average of the integers within this range?
Teacher: Great job finding the intersection range: from 25 to 63 in base 10. Now, on to step 4.

Step 4 involves calculating the average of all the integers in this range. Since these numbers form a consecutive list (an arithmetic sequence), we can use the formula for the average of an arithmetic sequence:

  Average = (first term + last term) / 2

Using the endpoints of the intersection (25 and 63), can you compute the average? Please show your work, and let me know your result.
Student: To calculate the average of all integers from \(25\) to \(63\), we can use the formula for the average of an arithmetic sequence:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{first term} + \text{last term}}{2}
\]

In this case, the first term is \(25\) and the last term is \(63\). 

Now, substituting these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{25 + 63}{2} = \frac{88}{2} = 44
\]

Therefore, the average of all positive integers that have three digits when written in base \(5\) but two digits when written in base \(8\) is \(44\) in base \(10\). 

Is there anything else you would like me to do?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly determined that the average of all positive integers between 25 and 63 is 44. The final answer is: 44$
