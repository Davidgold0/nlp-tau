Question: If $n$ is the smallest positive integer for which there exist positive real numbers $a$ and $b$ such that_x000D_
\[(a + bi)^n = (a - bi)^n,\]compute $\frac{b}{a}.$
3o-mini: We start by writing a + bi in polar form. Let

  a + bi = r·e^(iθ),  with r = √(a² + b²) and θ = arctan(b/a).

Then its complex conjugate is

  a − bi = r·e^(−iθ).

Raising these to the nth power, we have

  (a + bi)ⁿ = rⁿ·e^(i nθ)
  (a − bi)ⁿ = rⁿ·e^(−i nθ).

For these two expressions to be equal we require

  rⁿ·e^(i nθ) = rⁿ·e^(−i nθ).

Since rⁿ ≠ 0, we can cancel rⁿ to obtain

  e^(i nθ) = e^(−i nθ).

Multiplying both sides by e^(i nθ) gives

  e^(2i nθ) = 1.

This equation is satisfied if and only if

  2nθ = 2πk  for some integer k,
or
  nθ = πk.

Since a and b are positive, the angle θ satisfies 0 < θ < π/2. To find the smallest positive integer n for which such a θ exists, we set k = 1 (the smallest positive integer) and thus get

  θ = π/n.

We need π/n to be less than π/2, which implies

  π/n < π/2  ⇒  n > 2.

The smallest positive integer greater than 2 is n = 3. Therefore, when n = 3,

  θ = π/3.

Since θ = arctan(b/a), we have

  arctan(b/a) = π/3  ⇒  b/a = tan(π/3).

But tan(π/3) = √3. Hence, the ratio is

  b/a = √3.

Thus, under the given conditions, the value of b/a is √3.
