Question: If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2, then what is the degree of polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$?
Teacher: Let's begin by outlining the steps to solve the problem:

1. Write a general form for f(x) and g(x). For example, you might express f(x) as a polynomial like a₄x⁴ + a₃x³ + a₂x² + a₁x + a₀, where a₄ ≠ 0 since it’s degree 4. Similarly, express g(x) as b₂x² + b₁x + b₀, with b₂ ≠ 0.
2. Consider the subtraction f(x) – g(x) term by term. Think about which terms from f(x) and g(x) might combine or cancel, especially noting that g(x) does not have an x⁴ term.
3. Identify the term with the highest power in f(x) – g(x). Consider if any cancellation could affect the degree.
4. Conclude what the highest degree of the resulting polynomial is.

Now, let’s work step by step. For the very first step, could you please write down the general forms of the polynomials f(x) and g(x) as described?
Student: Sure! 

For the polynomial \( f(x) \) of degree 4, we can write it in general form as:

\[
f(x) = a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0
\]

where \( a_4 \neq 0 \).

For the polynomial \( g(x) \) of degree 2, we can express it as:

\[
g(x) = b_2 x^2 + b_1 x + b_0
\]

where \( b_2 \neq 0 \).

Now that we have the general forms of both polynomials, what should we do next?
Teacher: Great job outlining the forms of f(x) and g(x)! Now, for the next step, let's consider what happens when you subtract g(x) from f(x). Can you write the expression for f(x) – g(x) using the general forms we just defined? Please show your work on this step.
Student: Student: Sure! To subtract \( g(x) \) from \( f(x) \), we can write the expression for \( f(x) - g(x) \) using the general forms we defined:

\[
f(x) - g(x) = \left( a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 \right) - \left( b_2 x^2 + b_1 x + b_0 \right)
\]

Now, let's combine the terms:

\[
f(x) - g(x) = a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + (a_2 - b_2)x^2 + (a_1 - b_1)x + (a_0 - b_0)
\]

So the expression for \( f(x) - g(x) \) is:

\[
f(x) - g(x) = a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + (a_2 - b_2)x^2 + (a_1 - b_1)x + (a_0 - b_0)
\]

What should I consider next regarding the degree of this polynomial?
Teacher: Good work! You're on the right track by simplifying the expression. Now, we need to consider which term in the resulting polynomial determines its overall degree. Think about the highest power that appears and whether any cancellation might occur. Could you explain which term determines the degree and why, and then state what the degree of f(x) – g(x) is?
Student: Sure! In the expression we derived for \( f(x) - g(x) \):

\[
f(x) - g(x) = a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + (a_2 - b_2)x^2 + (a_1 - b_1)x + (a_0 - b_0)
\]

the term with the highest power is \( a_4 x^4 \), which corresponds to the degree 4 term from \( f(x) \). Since \( g(x) \) does not have an \( x^4 \) term, there is no possibility for cancellation of this term.

Therefore, the highest degree term in the resulting polynomial \( f(x) - g(x) \) is \( a_4 x^4 \), and since \( a_4 \neq 0 \), it remains in the polynomial. 

Thus, the degree of the polynomial \( f(x) - g(x) \) is:

\[
\text{Degree} = 4
\]

This means that the degree of the polynomial \( f(x) - g(x) \) is 4.
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly identified that the term a₄x⁴ determines the degree of the polynomial f(x) – g(x), and since there's no corresponding term in g(x) to cancel it, the degree remains 4.

Your final answer is: 4$
