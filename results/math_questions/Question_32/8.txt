Question: If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2, then what is the degree of polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$?
3o-mini: Let f(x) have a term ax⁴ (with a ≠ 0) and g(x) have a highest term bx² (with b ≠ 0). When subtracting, the resulting polynomial is f(x) - g(x) = ax⁴ + (terms of lower degree) - bx². Since g(x) does not include an x⁴ term, the highest degree term ax⁴ remains unchanged. Thus, the degree of f(x) - g(x) is 4.
