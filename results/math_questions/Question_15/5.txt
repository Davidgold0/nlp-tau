Question: Find all values of $k$ so that the domain of_x000D_
\[b(x) = \frac{kx^2 + 2x - 5}{-5x^2 + 2x + k}\]is the set of all real numbers.
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem. We need to find all values of k for which the function

  b(x) = (kx² + 2x – 5) / (–5x² + 2x + k)

has a domain of all real numbers. In other words, we want the denominator –5x² + 2x + k to never be zero for any real x.

To approach this problem, we can use these steps:

1. Recognize that the denominator is a quadratic in x.
2. Recall that a quadratic function has no real roots if its discriminant is negative.
3. Find the expression for the discriminant of the quadratic –5x² + 2x + k.
4. Set up the inequality for the discriminant to be less than zero.
5. Solve the inequality for k.

Now, to begin, could you please work on the first step: find the discriminant of the quadratic in the denominator and then write the inequality that must be satisfied so that the quadratic has no real roots?
Student: Sure! Let's start by identifying the quadratic in the denominator:

\[
-5x^2 + 2x + k
\]

The general form of a quadratic is \( ax^2 + bx + c \), where \( a = -5 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = k \). 

The discriminant \( D \) of a quadratic is given by the formula:

\[
D = b^2 - 4ac
\]

Now, substituting our values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) into the discriminant formula:

\[
D = (2)^2 - 4(-5)(k) = 4 + 20k
\]

Next, since we want the quadratic to have no real roots, we need the discriminant to be less than zero:

\[
4 + 20k < 0
\]

Now, we can solve this inequality for \( k \). Would you like me to proceed with that?
Teacher: Great work! You've correctly identified the quadratic, computed its discriminant as 4 + 20k, and set up the inequality 4 + 20k < 0 to ensure there are no real roots. Now, for the next step, please solve the inequality 4 + 20k < 0 for k. What do you get when you isolate k?
Student: Sure! Let's solve the inequality \( 4 + 20k < 0 \).

First, we can isolate \( k \) by subtracting 4 from both sides:

\[
20k < -4
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:

\[
k < -\frac{4}{20}
\]

Simplifying \(-\frac{4}{20}\) gives us:

\[
k < -\frac{1}{5}
\]

So, the solution to the inequality is:

\[
k < -\frac{1}{5}
\]

This means that for the function \( b(x) \) to have a domain of all real numbers, \( k \) must be less than \(-\frac{1}{5}\). Would you like me to summarize the findings or discuss the implications further?
Teacher: Great job on solving the inequality! You've correctly worked through isolating k and simplifying to get k < -1/5.

Before we wrap up, let's quickly reflect on this step together:

1. You identified the quadratic in the denominator as –5x² + 2x + k.
2. You computed the discriminant as 4 + 20k.
3. You set up the inequality 4 + 20k < 0 and solved it to get k < -1/5.

This is exactly the approach needed for ensuring that the quadratic has no real roots so that the denominator is never zero. 

You've now reached the final answer. 

k < -1/5$
