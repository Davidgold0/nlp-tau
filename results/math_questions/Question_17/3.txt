Question: Compute_x000D_
\[\frac{\tan^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ}{\tan^2 20^\circ \sin^2 20^\circ}.\]
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem. We need to simplify and compute the expression

  (tan²20° – sin²20°) / (tan²20° · sin²20°).

A good first step is to rewrite tan²20° in terms of sine and cosine. Can you tell me how to express tan²20° using sin20° and cos20°? Please solve that part, and we’ll work from there.
Student: Sure! The tangent function is defined as the ratio of sine to cosine. Therefore, we can express \(\tan^2 20^\circ\) as follows:

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ = \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}.
\]

So now we have:

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ = \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Would you like me to substitute this expression back into the original problem?
Teacher: Great work! Your expression for tan²20° is correct. Now, please substitute tan²20° = sin²20°/cos²20° into the original expression:

  (tan²20° – sin²20°) / (tan²20° · sin²20°).

Rewrite it step by step. What does the expression look like after you substitute? Please show your work.
Student: Sure! Let's substitute \(\tan^2 20^\circ = \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}\) into the original expression:

\[
\frac{\tan^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ}{\tan^2 20^\circ \cdot \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Substituting gives us:

\[
\frac{\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} - \sin^2 20^\circ}{\left(\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}\right) \cdot \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Now, let's simplify the numerator first:

1. The numerator is \(\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} - \sin^2 20^\circ\).
2. To combine these, we can write \(\sin^2 20^\circ\) as \(\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}\):
   \[
   \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} - \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}.
   \]

Now, let's simplify the denominator:

1. The denominator is \(\left(\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}\right) \cdot \sin^2 20^\circ\):
   \[
   = \frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}.
   \]

Putting it all together, we have:

\[
\frac{\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}}{\frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}}.
\]

Now we can simplify this expression further. Would you like me to proceed with that?
Teacher: Great job on the substitution and writing the expression as

  [(sin²20° – sin²20° cos²20°) / cos²20°] ÷ [sin⁴20° / cos²20°].

Now, for the next step, try simplifying this complex fraction. A good idea is to multiply the numerator and the denominator by cos²20° to cancel out that common factor. After doing that, you'll have:

  (sin²20° – sin²20° cos²20°) / sin⁴20°.

What do you get if you now factor sin²20° from the numerator? Please show your work for this step.
Student: Sure! Let's simplify the expression by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by \(\cos^2 20^\circ\):

\[
\frac{\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}}{\frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}} \cdot \frac{\cos^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}{\sin^4 20^\circ}.
\]

Now, we can factor \(\sin^2 20^\circ\) from the numerator:

\[
\sin^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ = \sin^2 20^\circ (1 - \cos^2 20^\circ).
\]

Since \(1 - \cos^2 20^\circ\) is equal to \(\sin^2 20^\circ\) (by the Pythagorean identity), we can substitute that in:

\[
\sin^2 20^\circ (1 - \cos^2 20^\circ) = \sin^2 20^\circ \cdot \sin^2 20^\circ = \sin^4 20^\circ.
\]

Now, substituting this back into our expression, we have:

\[
\frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\sin^4 20^\circ} = 1.
\]

So, the final simplified expression is:

\[
1.
\]

Would you like me to clarify any part of the solution?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've carefully simplified the expression step by step and correctly factored out sin²20° from the numerator. You recognized that (1 – cos²20°) equals sin²20° and thus simplified the whole expression to sin⁴20°/sin⁴20°, which gives 1.

You've reached the final answer.
