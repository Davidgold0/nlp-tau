Question: Compute_x000D_
\[\frac{\tan^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ}{\tan^2 20^\circ \sin^2 20^\circ}.\]
Teacher: Let's begin by understanding the problem. We need to simplify the expression

  (tan²20° – sin²20°) / (tan²20° ⋅ sin²20°).

A good strategy is to express everything in terms of sine and cosine so that common terms can be simplified. Here’s an outline of steps we might follow:

1. Rewrite tan²20° in terms of sine and cosine.
2. Substitute this expression into the formula.
3. Simplify the numerator and denominator by combining like terms or by finding a common denominator.
4. Use trigonometric identities (like sin²θ + cos²θ = 1) to simplify the expression further.
5. Arrive at the final simplified result.

Let's tackle the first step: Can you express tan²20° in terms of sine and cosine? Please solve this step and explain your reasoning.
Student: Sure! To express \(\tan^2 20^\circ\) in terms of sine and cosine, we can use the definition of the tangent function. The tangent of an angle is defined as the ratio of the sine of that angle to the cosine of the same angle. Therefore, we can write:

\[
\tan 20^\circ = \frac{\sin 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ}
\]

Now, to find \(\tan^2 20^\circ\), we simply square this expression:

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ = \left(\frac{\sin 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}
\]

So, we have expressed \(\tan^2 20^\circ\) in terms of sine and cosine. The next step would be to substitute this expression back into the original formula. Would you like me to proceed with that?
Teacher: Great work expressing tan²20° in terms of sine and cosine. Your reasoning is correct!

Now, let's move to the next step: substitute this expression into the original formula. Can you write the entire expression

  (tan²20° – sin²20°) / (tan²20° ⋅ sin²20°)

using your expression for tan²20°? Please show your substitution and simplify the expression as much as you can in this step.
Student: Student: Absolutely! Now that we have \(\tan^2 20^\circ\) expressed as \(\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}\), we can substitute this into the original expression:

\[
\frac{\tan^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ}{\tan^2 20^\circ \sin^2 20^\circ}
\]

Substituting for \(\tan^2 20^\circ\), we get:

\[
\frac{\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} - \sin^2 20^\circ}{\left(\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}\right) \sin^2 20^\circ}
\]

Now let's simplify the numerator:

\[
\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} - \sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}
\]

Factoring out \(\sin^2 20^\circ\) from the numerator gives:

\[
= \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ (1 - \cos^2 20^\circ)}{\cos^2 20^\circ}
\]

Using the identity \(1 - \cos^2 20^\circ = \sin^2 20^\circ\), we can rewrite this as:

\[
= \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ \cdot \sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}
\]

Now, substituting this back into the expression, we have:

\[
\frac{\frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}}{\left(\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}\right) \sin^2 20^\circ}
\]

The denominator simplifies to:

\[
\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ \cdot \sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}
\]

Now our overall expression looks like this:

\[
\frac{\frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}}{\frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}} = 1
\]

Thus, the entire expression simplifies to 1. 

Would you like me to summarize the steps or clarify anything further?
Teacher: Great work on completing the substitution and simplification! Let’s review what you did step by step:

1. You correctly rewrote tan²20° as (sin²20°/cos²20°).
2. You then substituted that into the original expression to get  
  [ (sin²20°/cos²20°) – sin²20° ] / [ (sin²20°/cos²20°) · sin²20° ].
3. You combined the terms in the numerator by writing a common denominator and then factored out sin²20°. This led you to get  
  [ sin²20°(1 – cos²20°) / cos²20° ].
4. Recognizing that 1 – cos²20° equals sin²20° (by the Pythagorean identity), you simplified the numerator to sin⁴20°/cos²20°.
5. You noticed that the denominator was also sin⁴20°/cos²20°, which allowed you to conclude that the entire expression simplifies to 1.

Your process and use of identities were spot on!

With all these steps checked, your final answer is: 1$
