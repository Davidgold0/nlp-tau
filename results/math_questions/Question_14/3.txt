Question: One year ago, the number of years in Jane's age was a perfect square, and one year from now, her age will be a perfect cube. How many years old is Jane?
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem. We know:

• One year ago, Jane’s age was a perfect square.
• One year from now, her age will be a perfect cube.

Let’s introduce variables to describe this. Imagine we call Jane’s current age x. Then:

• One year ago, her age was x – 1, which is a perfect square.
• One year from now, her age will be x + 1, which is a perfect cube.

Now, try the following step:

Step 1: Express Jane's age in terms of a perfect square and a perfect cube by assigning variables. For example, let’s say that for some integer a, x – 1 = a². Similarly, for some integer b, x + 1 = b³. 

Based on these expressions, how can you write x in terms of a and in terms of b? (Please provide only this step.)
Student: Sure! Based on the hints you provided, I can express Jane's age in terms of the perfect square and the perfect cube.

From the first expression, we have:
- \( x - 1 = a^2 \)
So, if we solve for \( x \), we get:
- \( x = a^2 + 1 \)

From the second expression, we have:
- \( x + 1 = b^3 \)
Solving for \( x \) gives us:
- \( x = b^3 - 1 \)

Now we have two expressions for \( x \):
1. \( x = a^2 + 1 \)
2. \( x = b^3 - 1 \)

This means we can set these two expressions equal to each other:
- \( a^2 + 1 = b^3 - 1 \)

Is this the step you were looking for?
Teacher: Excellent work! Your expressions for Jane’s age are correct:

• x = a² + 1  
• x = b³ - 1  

And yes, setting these equal gives us a² + 1 = b³ - 1.

Now, for the next step, try to simplify this equation by rearranging the terms. What equation do you get when you simplify a² + 1 = b³ - 1?
Student: Sure! To simplify the equation \( a^2 + 1 = b^3 - 1 \), we can rearrange it by moving all terms to one side. 

Starting from:
\[ a^2 + 1 = b^3 - 1 \]

We can add 1 to both sides:
\[ a^2 + 2 = b^3 \]

So, the simplified equation we get is:
\[ b^3 - a^2 = 2 \]

Is this the correct simplification you were looking for?
Teacher: Great job on simplifying the equation correctly! Now, our equation is b³ – a² = 2. 

For the next step, let’s try to find integer values for a and b that satisfy this equation. Here's what to do:

Step 2: Consider small integer values for b. For example, start by substituting b = 2 into the equation b³ – a² = 2. Calculate what a² must be, and then determine the corresponding value of a. 

Please work through this step and show your reasoning.
Student: Sure! Let's start by substituting \( b = 2 \) into the equation \( b^3 - a^2 = 2 \).

Calculating \( b^3 \) when \( b = 2 \):
\[
b^3 = 2^3 = 8
\]

Now, we can substitute this into the equation:
\[
8 - a^2 = 2
\]

Next, we can rearrange this to solve for \( a^2 \):
\[
8 - 2 = a^2
\]
\[
6 = a^2
\]

Now, to find \( a \), we take the square root of both sides:
\[
a = \sqrt{6}
\]

Since \( \sqrt{6} \) is not an integer, we can try the next integer value for \( b \).

Let's try \( b = 3 \):
\[
b^3 = 3^3 = 27
\]

Substituting this into the equation:
\[
27 - a^2 = 2
\]

Rearranging gives us:
\[
27 - 2 = a^2
\]
\[
25 = a^2
\]

Now, taking the square root of both sides:
\[
a = 5
\]

So we have \( a = 5 \) and \( b = 3 \). 

Now we can use these values to find Jane's current age \( x \). 

Using the expression \( x = a^2 + 1 \):
\[
x = 5^2 + 1 = 25 + 1 = 26
\]

Thus, Jane's current age is 26 years old. 

Is this the correct approach?
Teacher: Great work! Your substitution of b = 2 led to a non-integer value for a (since a² = 6 isn’t a perfect square), and then trying b = 3 yielded a² = 25, from which a = 5. Using x = a² + 1 then gives you Jane’s age as 26. 

Before confirming your final answer, can you double-check by verifying that one year ago her age (26 − 1 = 25) is indeed a perfect square and one year from now (26 + 1 = 27) is a perfect cube? Once you’ve confirmed this, please let me know your revised conclusion.
Student: Sure! Let's verify the conditions for Jane's age:

1. **One year ago**: 
   - Jane's age was \( 26 - 1 = 25 \).
   - We need to check if 25 is a perfect square. 
   - Since \( 5^2 = 25 \), it is indeed a perfect square.

2. **One year from now**: 
   - Jane's age will be \( 26 + 1 = 27 \).
   - We need to check if 27 is a perfect cube.
   - Since \( 3^3 = 27 \), it is indeed a perfect cube.

Both conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Jane's current age is confirmed to be **26 years old**. 

Thank you for guiding me through the problem!
Teacher: You've done a great job verifying the conditions! To summarize:

• We set up the equations: x – 1 = a² and x + 1 = b³.
• This led to the equation b³ – a² = 2.
• Substituting b = 2 gave a non-integer a, while b = 3 gave a² = 25 (so a = 5).
• Plugging a = 5 into x = a² + 1 produces x = 26.
• Finally, we verified that 25 (26 – 1) is a perfect square and 27 (26 + 1) is a perfect cube.

Thus, Jane's current age is 26$
