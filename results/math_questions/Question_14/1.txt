Question: One year ago, the number of years in Jane's age was a perfect square, and one year from now, her age will be a perfect cube. How many years old is Jane?
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem into smaller steps.

Step 1: Rephrase and set up the equations.
We can let Jane’s current age be x. From the problem we have:
 - One year ago, her age (x − 1) was a perfect square.
 - One year from now, her age (x + 1) will be a perfect cube.

Could you express these conditions as equations using variables for the perfect square and perfect cube? What would those equations look like?
Student: Sure! Let's break down the conditions given in the problem.

1. One year ago, Jane's age was a perfect square. We can express this as:
   \[
   x - 1 = n^2
   \]
   where \( n \) is some integer.

2. One year from now, Jane's age will be a perfect cube. We can express this as:
   \[
   x + 1 = m^3
   \]
   where \( m \) is also some integer.

Now we have two equations:
1. \( x - 1 = n^2 \)
2. \( x + 1 = m^3 \)

From these equations, we can also express \( x \) in terms of \( n \) and \( m \):
- From the first equation, we can rearrange it to find \( x \):
  \[
  x = n^2 + 1
  \]
- From the second equation, we can also rearrange it:
  \[
  x = m^3 - 1
  \]

Now we have:
\[
n^2 + 1 = m^3 - 1
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
m^3 - n^2 = 2
\]

So, we can look for integer values of \( m \) and \( n \) that satisfy this equation. Would you like me to continue with finding suitable values for \( m \) and \( n \)?
Teacher: Great work rephrasing the equations! Now let's move on to the next step.

Step 2: We need to find integer values for n and m that satisfy the equation

  m³ – n² = 2

A good approach is to test small values for m. For example, try m = 3. If you substitute m = 3 into the equation, what value for n² do you get, and does it correspond to a perfect square? Please solve this step and share your reasoning.
Student: Sure! Let's test \( m = 3 \) in the equation \( m^3 - n^2 = 2 \).

First, we calculate \( m^3 \):
\[
m^3 = 3^3 = 27
\]

Now, we substitute this value into the equation:
\[
27 - n^2 = 2
\]

Next, we can solve for \( n^2 \):
\[
n^2 = 27 - 2 = 25
\]

Now we check if \( n^2 = 25 \) corresponds to a perfect square. Since \( n^2 = 25 \), we find that:
\[
n = 5 \quad (\text{because } 5^2 = 25)
\]

So, we have found that when \( m = 3 \), \( n = 5 \) works, as both \( n^2 \) is a perfect square and \( m^3 \) is a perfect cube.

Now, we can use these values to find Jane's current age \( x \). We can use either of the earlier equations. Let's use \( x = m^3 - 1 \):
\[
x = 27 - 1 = 26
\]

To confirm, we can also use the other equation \( x = n^2 + 1 \):
\[
x = 25 + 1 = 26
\]

Both approaches give us the same result.

So, Jane is currently **26 years old**. Would you like me to summarize the findings or go through any additional steps?
Teacher: Great work! You've carefully tested m = 3, found that n = 5, and then used one of the equations to determine x. Your calculations show that Jane is 26 years old. To summarize:

• We set up the equations: x − 1 = n² and x + 1 = m³.
• Substituting m = 3, we got m³ = 27, then found n² = 27 − 2 = 25.
• Since 25 is a perfect square, n = 5.
• Using either equation, we found x = 26.
  
Your reasoning is correct. The final answer is: 26$
