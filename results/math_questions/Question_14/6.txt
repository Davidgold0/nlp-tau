Question: One year ago, the number of years in Jane's age was a perfect square, and one year from now, her age will be a perfect cube. How many years old is Jane?
3o-mini: Let Jane's current age be x. According to the problem, one year ago her age was a perfect square and one year from now her age will be a perfect cube. This gives us the following equations:

  x - 1 = n²  (for some integer n)  
  x + 1 = m³  (for some integer m)

Subtracting the first equation from the second, we have:

  (x + 1) - (x - 1) = m³ - n²  
  2 = m³ - n²

We now look for small integer values of m such that m³ - n² = 2.

Trying m = 2:
  2³ = 8, so n² = 8 - 2 = 6, which is not a perfect square.

Trying m = 3:
  3³ = 27, so n² = 27 - 2 = 25, which is a perfect square (since n = 5).

Now, substitute back into the equations:
  x - 1 = 5² = 25 → x = 25 + 1 = 26  
  x + 1 = 27, which indeed equals 3³

Thus, Jane is 26 years old.
