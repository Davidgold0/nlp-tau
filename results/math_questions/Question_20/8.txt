3o-mini: To compute the determinant of the matrix

  | 2 0 -1 |
  | 7 4 -3 |
  | 2 2  5 |,

you can use the expansion along the first row.

1. For the element in the first row, first column (2), form its submatrix by deleting its row and column:
  | 4 -3 |
  | 2  5 |.
 The determinant of this submatrix is (4×5) – ((-3)×2) = 20 + 6 = 26.
 Then, multiply by 2: 2 × 26 = 52.

2. For the element in the first row, second column (0), its submatrix is:
  | 7 -3 |
  | 2  5 |.
 However, since the entry is 0, this term is 0.

3. For the element in the first row, third column (-1), form its submatrix by deleting its row and column:
  | 7 4 |
  | 2 2 |.
 The determinant of this submatrix is (7×2) – (4×2) = 14 – 8 = 6.
 Since this element is in the first row, third column, the sign is positive (because (-1)^(1+3)=+1). Multiply: (-1) × 6 = -6.

4. Now, combine all the terms:
  Determinant = 52 + 0 - 6 = 46.

Thus, the determinant is 46.
