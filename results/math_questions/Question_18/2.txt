Teacher: Let's start by outlining the process to solve the problem:

Step 1: Recall the formula for the area of a triangle. For a triangle with base b and height h, the area A is given by A = (1/2) × base × height. 

Given that the area is 27 cm² and the base is 6 cm, we can substitute these values into the formula and solve for h.

Now, please write down the equation you get when you plug in the given values for the area and the base. What equation do you come up with?
Student: Sure! The formula for the area of a triangle is:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

Given that the area \( A \) is \( 27 \, \text{cm}^2 \) and the base \( b \) is \( 6 \, \text{cm} \), we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[
27 = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times h
\]

Now, this is the equation I came up with. What should I do next?
Teacher: Your equation is perfectly set up: 27 = (1/2) × 6 × h.

Now, for the next step, please solve this equation for h. How would you isolate h to find its value?
Student: Student: To isolate \( h \) in the equation \( 27 = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times h \), I will first simplify the right side of the equation.

1. Calculate \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3
   \]

2. Now, the equation becomes:
   \[
   27 = 3h
   \]

3. Next, to solve for \( h \), I will divide both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   h = \frac{27}{3}
   \]

4. This simplifies to:
   \[
   h = 9
   \]

So, the height \( h \) of triangle \( PQR \) is \( 9 \, \text{cm} \). Is this correct?
Teacher: You've done an excellent job simplifying the equation and isolating h! Your steps were:

1. Multiplying 1/2 by 6 to get 3, so the equation became 27 = 3h.
2. Dividing both sides by 3, which correctly led to h = 27/3.
3. Simplifying to h = 9.

Your reasoning and calculations are correct. Now that you've reached the final answer, state your final answer followed immediately by a $ with nothing after it.
Student: The height \( h \) of triangle \( PQR \) is \( 9 \, \text{cm} \). $
Teacher: Great work! You've successfully solved the problem by first setting up the equation 27 = (1/2) × 6 × h and then simplifying it step by step until you found that h = 9. Now, as instructed, please state the final answer with a $ immediately after.
Student: The height \( h \) of triangle \( PQR \) is \( 9 \, \text{cm} \). $
Teacher: Great work! You've correctly followed all the steps: setting up the equation using the formula for a triangle's area, simplifying to 27 = 3h, and then solving for h to reach h = 9. 

Now, please state your final answer as instructed, followed immediately by a $ with nothing after it.
Student: The height \( h \) of triangle \( PQR \) is \( 9 \, \text{cm} \). $
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly set up and solved the equation to find the height of the triangle. The final answer is:
9$
