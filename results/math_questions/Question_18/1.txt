Teacher: Let's start by outlining the approach to solving this problem.

1. Recognize that the area of a triangle can be found using the formula:  
  Area = (1/2) × base × height.
2. Substitute the given values (area = 27 cm² and base = 6 cm) into the formula.
3. Write an equation with the unknown height, h.
4. Solve the equation for h.

Now, please go ahead and set up the equation by substituting the known values into the formula. What equation do you get?
Student: Sure! Based on the area formula for a triangle, which is:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

I can substitute the known values into this formula. The area is given as \(27 \, \text{cm}^2\) and the base is \(6 \, \text{cm}\). 

So, substituting these values, I get:

\[
27 = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times h
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
27 = 3h
\]

Now I have the equation \(27 = 3h\). Would you like me to solve for \(h\) now?
Teacher: Great work setting up the equation! You correctly substituted the values into the area formula and simplified it to 27 = 3h.

Now, as the next step, please solve for h by isolating it in the equation. How would you do that, and what value do you get for h?
Student: To isolate \(h\) in the equation \(27 = 3h\), I can divide both sides of the equation by \(3\). This will give me the height \(h\).

So, I perform the division:

\[
h = \frac{27}{3}
\]

Calculating that gives:

\[
h = 9
\]

Therefore, the height \(h\) of triangle \(PQR\) is \(9 \, \text{cm}\).
Teacher: You've done excellent work! You began by correctly setting up the equation using the area formula for a triangle:

  27 = (½) × 6 × h  →  27 = 3h

Then you solved for h by dividing both sides by 3, arriving at h = 9.

So, the height of the triangle is 9$
