Question: The operation $\clubsuit$ is defined by $x\clubsuit y =|x|^3+y$. What is the value of $2\clubsuit 4$?
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem into clear steps. We need to evaluate 2 ♣ 4 using the operation defined by x ♣ y = |x|³ + y. Here’s how we can approach it:

Step 1: Identify the value of x and compute its absolute value. Since x = 2, what is |2|?

Please go ahead and solve this first step.
Student: To solve the first step, we need to find the absolute value of \( x \), where \( x = 2 \). 

The absolute value of \( 2 \) is \( |2| = 2 \).

So, I have \( |2| = 2 \). What should I do next?
Teacher: Great job! You correctly found that |2| = 2.

Now, let's move to the next step: We need to compute the cube of the absolute value you just found, which is (|2|)³. What is 2³? Please work on this next step.
Student: To compute the cube of the absolute value we found, which is \( |2| = 2 \), we need to calculate \( 2^3 \).

Calculating \( 2^3 \):
\[
2^3 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8
\]

So, \( (|2|)^3 = 8 \). What should I do next?
Teacher: Great job calculating 2³ = 8! Now, let's move to the next step. We need to use the definition of the operation, which tells us that x ♣ y = |x|³ + y. For our problem, x = 2 and y = 4. So we need to add y (which is 4) to the 8 we just calculated.

Please go ahead and compute 8 + 4. What do you get?
Student: To compute \( 8 + 4 \):

\[
8 + 4 = 12
\]

So, the value of \( 2 \clubsuit 4 \) is \( 12 \). Is there anything else you would like to discuss about this problem?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly followed every step:

1. You determined that |2| = 2.
2. You computed (|2|)³ = 2³ = 8.
3. You added y = 4 to get 8 + 4 = 12.

The final answer is 12$
