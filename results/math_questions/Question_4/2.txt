Question: Three tiles are marked X and two other tiles are marked O. The five tiles are randomly arranged in a row. What is the probability that the arrangement reads XOXOX?
Teacher: Okay, let’s break down the problem step by step. We have three tiles marked X and two tiles marked O, and they are randomly arranged in a row. Our goal is to find the probability that the arrangement reads XOXOX.

Here’s an outline of steps we need to follow:

1. First, determine the total number of distinct arrangements possible with three X’s and two O’s.
2. Next, find how many of those arrangements match the sequence XOXOX.
3. Finally, compute the probability by taking the ratio of the favorable outcomes (XOXOX) to the total number of possible arrangements.

To start, can you determine the total number of distinct arrangements of the 5 tiles, given there are 3 X's and 2 O's? Please show your thinking for this step.
Student: To determine the total number of distinct arrangements of the 5 tiles (three X's and two O's), we can use the formula for permutations of a multiset. The formula is:

\[
\text{Total arrangements} = \frac{n!}{n_1! \times n_2!}
\]

where:
- \( n \) is the total number of items,
- \( n_1 \) is the number of items of one type (X's),
- \( n_2 \) is the number of items of another type (O's).

In our case:
- \( n = 5 \) (total tiles),
- \( n_1 = 3 \) (X's),
- \( n_2 = 2 \) (O's).

Now, substituting these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Total arrangements} = \frac{5!}{3! \times 2!}
\]

Calculating the factorials:
- \( 5! = 120 \)
- \( 3! = 6 \)
- \( 2! = 2 \)

Now, plugging in these values:

\[
\text{Total arrangements} = \frac{120}{6 \times 2} = \frac{120}{12} = 10
\]

So, the total number of distinct arrangements of the tiles is **10**. 

Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Excellent work! You're absolutely right that the total number of distinct arrangements is 10. Now, let's move on to the next step.

Given the arrangement "XOXOX", how many of those total arrangements exactly match this sequence? Please explain your thinking and answer for this step.
Student: Student: Thank you, Teacher! Now, to find how many of the total arrangements match the specific sequence "XOXOX", we need to consider that this arrangement is just one specific way to arrange the tiles.

Since "XOXOX" is a fixed sequence, there is only **1** arrangement that matches it exactly. This means that out of the 10 total arrangements we calculated earlier, only one of those arrangements is "XOXOX".

So, the number of arrangements that match the sequence "XOXOX" is **1**.

Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Great job! You're absolutely correct that only 1 arrangement out of the 10 possible arrangements matches the sequence XOXOX.

Now for the final step: Can you compute the probability of this arrangement (XOXOX) by forming the ratio of the favorable outcome to the total number of outcomes? Please show your reasoning and answer for this step.
Student: Student: Thank you, Teacher! To compute the probability of the arrangement "XOXOX", we need to form the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes.

From our previous steps, we know:
- The number of favorable outcomes (arrangements matching "XOXOX") is **1**.
- The total number of distinct arrangements is **10**.

So, the probability \( P \) can be calculated as follows:

\[
P(\text{XOXOX}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{1}{10}
\]

Therefore, the probability that the arrangement reads "XOXOX" is **\(\frac{1}{10}\)**.

Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Excellent work! Your reasoning is clear and correct. The probability that the arrangement reads XOXOX is given by the ratio of favorable outcomes (which is 1) to the total number of arrangements (which is 10). 

So, the final answer is: 1/10$
