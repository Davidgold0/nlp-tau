Question: Three tiles are marked X and two other tiles are marked O. The five tiles are randomly arranged in a row. What is the probability that the arrangement reads XOXOX?
Teacher: Let's begin by outlining the steps we need to take to solve the problem:

1. Clarify the total number of arrangements: Since we have 3 X's and 2 O's, the total number of unique arrangements can be found using the formula for permutations with repetition.
2. Identify the favorable outcome: In this problem, we are looking for only one specific arrangement, which is XOXOX.
3. Calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of arrangements.

Now, let's start with the first step. Could you please tell me how you would calculate the total number of unique arrangements of these five tiles (using 3 X’s and 2 O’s)? Please show your work for this step.
Student: To calculate the total number of unique arrangements of the five tiles (3 X's and 2 O's), we can use the formula for permutations with repetition, which is given by:

\[
\text{Total arrangements} = \frac{n!}{n_1! \times n_2!}
\]

where:
- \( n \) is the total number of items,
- \( n_1 \) is the number of identical items of one type (X's),
- \( n_2 \) is the number of identical items of another type (O's).

In this case:
- \( n = 5 \) (total tiles),
- \( n_1 = 3 \) (X's),
- \( n_2 = 2 \) (O's).

Now, we can plug these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Total arrangements} = \frac{5!}{3! \times 2!}
\]

Calculating the factorials:
- \( 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 \)
- \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \)
- \( 2! = 2 \times 1 = 2 \)

Now substituting these values back into the formula:

\[
\text{Total arrangements} = \frac{120}{6 \times 2} = \frac{120}{12} = 10
\]

So, the total number of unique arrangements of the tiles is 10. 

Is this step correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Great job! Your calculation of the total number of unique arrangements is correct. Now, let's move on to the next step.

Remember, we need to identify how many favorable outcomes there are for the arrangement to read XOXOX.

Could you please determine the number of favorable outcomes (arrangements that read XOXOX) and explain your reasoning for this step?
Student: Student: Thank you, Teacher! For the next step, we need to identify the number of favorable outcomes that match the arrangement XOXOX.

In this case, there is only one specific arrangement that reads XOXOX. Since we are looking for that exact sequence, the number of favorable outcomes is simply 1.

To summarize:
- The arrangement XOXOX is unique and does not have any other variations that would still read as XOXOX.
- Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 1.

Is this reasoning correct, Teacher?
Teacher: You're absolutely right; there is exactly one arrangement that reads XOXOX. Now, for the final step, we need to compute the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of unique arrangements. Could you please perform that calculation? (Remember: Probability = Favorable outcomes ÷ Total outcomes.)
Student: Student: Thank you, Teacher! To calculate the probability, we will use the formula:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of arrangements}}
\]

From our previous steps, we found:
- The number of favorable outcomes (for the arrangement XOXOX) is 1.
- The total number of unique arrangements is 10.

Now, substituting these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{1}{10}
\]

So, the probability that the arrangement reads XOXOX is \( \frac{1}{10} \). 

Is my final answer correct, Teacher?
Teacher: You've done a great job working through the problem step by step! Let's quickly summarize:

1. We first calculated the total number of unique arrangements using the formula for permutations with repetition, arriving at 10.
2. Then, we identified that there is exactly 1 favorable outcome (the arrangement XOXOX).
3. Finally, you computed the probability by dividing the favorable outcomes (1) by the total arrangements (10), giving a probability of 1/10.

Your final answer is correct!

1/10$
