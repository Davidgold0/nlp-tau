Question: Three tiles are marked X and two other tiles are marked O. The five tiles are randomly arranged in a row. What is the probability that the arrangement reads XOXOX?
3o-mini: There are 5 positions to fill with 3 X's and 2 O's. The total number of distinct arrangements is given by the number of ways to choose 3 positions (out of 5) for the X's, which is C(5, 3) = 10.

The arrangement XOXOX corresponds to the X's being in the 1st, 3rd, and 5th positions. There is exactly 1 arrangement that produces XOXOX.

Thus, the probability is 1/10.
