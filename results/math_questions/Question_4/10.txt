Question: Three tiles are marked X and two other tiles are marked O. The five tiles are randomly arranged in a row. What is the probability that the arrangement reads XOXOX?
3o-mini: There are 5 positions, and the total number of distinct arrangements of the three X’s and two O’s is calculated by the formula for permutations of a multiset: 5!/(3!*2!) = 10.

The arrangement XOXOX is just one specific outcome among these 10. Therefore, the probability that the arrangement reads XOXOX is 1/10.
