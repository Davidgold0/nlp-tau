Question: Find all values of $k$ so that_x000D_
\[x^2 - (k - 3) x - k + 6 > 0\]for all $x.$
3o-mini: We are given the inequality

  x² - (k - 3)x - k + 6 > 0

and we want it to be true for all real numbers x.

Step 1. Write the quadratic in standard form.
The quadratic can be written as

  x² - (k - 3)x + (6 - k).

Here, the coefficient of x² is 1, which is positive, so the parabola opens upward. For a quadratic that opens upward to be positive for all x, its discriminant must be negative (so it has no real roots).

Step 2. Compute the discriminant.
For a quadratic ax² + bx + c, the discriminant is given by D = b² - 4ac. In our case:
  a = 1,
  b = -(k - 3) = 3 - k,
  c = 6 - k.
Thus,
  D = (3 - k)² - 4(1)(6 - k).

Expanding the square,
  (3 - k)² = k² - 6k + 9.
So, 
  D = (k² - 6k + 9) - (24 - 4k) 
    = k² - 6k + 9 - 24 + 4k 
    = k² - 2k - 15.

Step 3. Set the discriminant less than 0.
We require:
  k² - 2k - 15 < 0.

Factor the quadratic:
  k² - 2k - 15 = (k - 5)(k + 3).

The inequality (k - 5)(k + 3) < 0 holds when the factors have opposite signs. This happens when:
  -3 < k < 5.

Step 4. Consider the endpoints.
If k = -3 or k = 5, the discriminant is 0 and the quadratic has a double root where it equals 0, which does not satisfy the strict inequality (> 0).

Conclusion:
The quadratic is positive for all x if and only if

  -3 < k < 5.

Thus, the solution is: k ∈ (-3, 5).
