Question: Find all values of $k$ so that_x000D_
\[x^2 - (k - 3) x - k + 6 > 0\]for all $x.$
Teacher: Let’s start by understanding what the problem is asking. We need to find all values of k such that the inequality

  x² – (k – 3)x – k + 6 > 0

holds for every value of x.

A good strategy for these types of quadratic inequalities is to ensure two things:
 1. The coefficient of x² is positive (so the parabola opens upward).
 2. The quadratic has no real roots (its discriminant is negative).

In our expression:
 • The coefficient of x² is 1 (which is positive).
 • Now, we need to work on finding the discriminant in terms of k.

What is your next step? Could you compute the discriminant of the quadratic expression in terms of k? Please show your work for this step.
Student: Sure! To find the discriminant of the quadratic expression \(x^2 - (k - 3)x - k + 6\), we first need to identify the coefficients in the standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c\).

Here, we have:
- \(a = 1\)
- \(b = -(k - 3) = -k + 3\)
- \(c = -k + 6\)

The discriminant \(D\) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c\) is given by the formula:
\[
D = b^2 - 4ac
\]

Now, substituting in our values:
\[
D = (-k + 3)^2 - 4(1)(-k + 6)
\]

Let's expand this step by step.

First, we calculate \((-k + 3)^2\):
\[
(-k + 3)^2 = k^2 - 6k + 9
\]

Next, we calculate \(4(1)(-k + 6)\):
\[
4(-k + 6) = -4k + 24
\]

Now, we can combine these results to find the discriminant:
\[
D = (k^2 - 6k + 9) - (-4k + 24)
\]
\[
D = k^2 - 6k + 9 + 4k - 24
\]
\[
D = k^2 - 2k - 15
\]

So, the discriminant in terms of \(k\) is:
\[
D = k^2 - 2k - 15
\]

What should we do next with this discriminant?
Teacher: Great job finding the discriminant! Now, recall that for the quadratic to be positive for all x, its discriminant must be less than 0. 

So the next step is to set up the inequality using the discriminant you found:
  k² - 2k - 15 < 0

Could you now find the values of k that satisfy this inequality? Please show your work for this step.
Student: Sure! To solve the inequality \(k^2 - 2k - 15 < 0\), we first need to factor the quadratic expression.

We can start by finding the roots of the equation \(k^2 - 2k - 15 = 0\) using the factoring method. We look for two numbers that multiply to \(-15\) (the constant term) and add to \(-2\) (the coefficient of \(k\)). 

The numbers that satisfy this are \(3\) and \(-5\), since:
\[
3 \times (-5) = -15 \quad \text{and} \quad 3 + (-5) = -2.
\]

Thus, we can factor the quadratic as:
\[
(k - 5)(k + 3) < 0.
\]

Next, we need to determine the intervals where this product is negative. To do this, we identify the critical points where the expression equals zero:
\[
k - 5 = 0 \Rightarrow k = 5, \quad k + 3 = 0 \Rightarrow k = -3.
\]

These points divide the number line into three intervals:
1. \( (-\infty, -3) \)
2. \( (-3, 5) \)
3. \( (5, \infty) \)

Now, we can test a point from each interval to see where the product \((k - 5)(k + 3)\) is negative:

1. For the interval \( (-\infty, -3) \), let’s test \(k = -4\):
   \[
   (-4 - 5)(-4 + 3) = (-9)(-1) = 9 \quad (\text{positive})
   \]

2. For the interval \( (-3, 5) \), let’s test \(k = 0\):
   \[
   (0 - 5)(0 + 3) = (-5)(3) = -15 \quad (\text{negative})
   \]

3. For the interval \( (5, \infty) \), let’s test \(k = 6\):
   \[
   (6 - 5)(6 + 3) = (1)(9) = 9 \quad (\text{positive})
   \]

From our tests, we find that the expression \((k - 5)(k + 3) < 0\) is satisfied in the interval:
\[
(-3, 5).
\]

Thus, the values of \(k\) that satisfy the inequality \(k^2 - 2k - 15 < 0\) are:
\[
\boxed{(-3, 5)}.
\] 

This means that for all values of \(k\) in the interval \((-3, 5)\), the original quadratic expression \(x^2 - (k - 3)x - k + 6 > 0\) holds for all \(x\).
Teacher: Great work on factoring the quadratic and testing the intervals! You've correctly determined that (k – 5)(k + 3) < 0 for k in the interval (–3, 5).

Before we move to the final answer, let's quickly review our reasoning:
 1. We rewrote the quadratic in standard form and identified a = 1, b = –k + 3, and c = –k + 6.
 2. We computed the discriminant as D = k² – 2k – 15.
 3. Since the quadratic must be positive for all x (with a positive leading coefficient), the discriminant must be less than 0, so we set up k² – 2k – 15 < 0.
 4. Factoring, we obtained (k – 5)(k + 3) < 0, and by checking intervals, found that k ∈ (–3, 5).

Could you please now summarize these steps in your own words and then state your final answer (remember to append your answer immediately by a $ with nothing after it)?
Student: Sure! Here’s a summary of the steps we took to solve the problem:

1. We started with the quadratic inequality \(x^2 - (k - 3)x - k + 6 > 0\) and recognized that the coefficient of \(x^2\) is positive, indicating the parabola opens upward.
2. We found the discriminant of the quadratic, which is \(D = k^2 - 2k - 15\). This is important because for the quadratic to be positive for all \(x\), the discriminant must be less than zero.
3. We set up the inequality \(k^2 - 2k - 15 < 0\) and factored it to \((k - 5)(k + 3) < 0\).
4. We identified the critical points \(k = -3\) and \(k = 5\), which divided the number line into intervals.
5. By testing points from each interval, we determined that the inequality holds true in the interval \((-3, 5)\).

Therefore, the final answer is that the values of \(k\) for which the inequality holds for all \(x\) are:

\[
\boxed{(-3, 5)}
\]
Teacher: You've done an excellent job summarizing the solution steps. Your summary is clear and complete:

1. Recognize the quadratic inequality with a positive coefficient for x².
2. Compute the discriminant D = k² - 2k - 15.
3. Set up the condition D < 0 (since the quadratic must be positive for all x).
4. Factor the inequality to (k - 5)(k + 3) < 0.
5. Determine by testing intervals that k ∈ (-3, 5).

Based on these steps, your final answer is:

(-3, 5)$
