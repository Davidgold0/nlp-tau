Question: Let \[P(x) = (2x^4 - 26x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c)(5x^4 - 80x^3 + dx^2 + ex + f),\]where $a, b, c, d, e, f$ are real numbers. Suppose that the set of all complex roots of $P(x)$ is $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}.$ Find $P(6).$
Teacher: Let's start by breaking the problem into manageable steps. We have

  P(x) = (2x⁴ – 26x³ + ax² + bx + c)(5x⁴ – 80x³ + dx² + ex + f)

and we’re told that the set of all complex roots of P(x) is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Notice that even though each factor is quartic (degree 4) so that P(x) is of degree 8, there are only 5 distinct roots. This means some of the roots must be repeated (have multiplicities). Our task is to find P(6).

To get there, here are the key steps we will follow:

1. Determine the total sum of the roots (with multiplicities) using the given factors:
 a. Use the first factor’s coefficients to determine its roots’ sum.
 b. Use the second factor’s coefficients similarly.
 c. Add these to get the sum of the eight roots of P(x).

2. Express the product P(x) in factored form as
  P(x) = 10·(x–1)^(m₁)·(x–2)^(m₂)·(x–3)^(m₃)·(x–4)^(m₄)·(x–5)^(m₅)
 where m₁ + m₂ + m₃ + m₄ + m₅ = 8 (the total degree) and each mᵢ ≥ 1 (since every number 1 through 5 is a root).

3. Use the total sum of the roots (using multiplicities) from step 1 and set up an equation:
  1·m₁ + 2·m₂ + 3·m₃ + 4·m₄ + 5·m₅ = (sum obtained in step 1)
 Then solve for the values of m₁, m₂, m₃, m₄, and m₅.

4. Once the multiplicities are determined, write P(x) fully in its factored form with constant 10 (from multiplying 2 and 5).

5. Finally, evaluate P(6) by plugging x = 6 into your factored expression.

Let's begin with Step 1.

Step 1: Determine the sum of the roots (with multiplicities) for each factor using their x³ and x⁴ coefficients.
 • For the first factor 2x⁴ – 26x³ + …, what is the sum of its roots?
 • For the second factor 5x⁴ – 80x³ + …, what is the sum of its roots?

Please work on finding the sum of the roots for the first polynomial (2x⁴ – 26x³ + …). What do you get?
Student: To find the sum of the roots for the first polynomial \(2x^4 - 26x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c\), we can use Vieta's formulas. According to Vieta's, the sum of the roots of a polynomial \(ax^n + bx^{n-1} + ...\) is given by \(-\frac{b}{a}\).

For the first polynomial:

- The coefficient \(a = 2\) (the coefficient of \(x^4\))
- The coefficient \(b = -26\) (the coefficient of \(x^3\))

Using Vieta's formula, the sum of the roots for this polynomial is:

\[
-\frac{-26}{2} = \frac{26}{2} = 13.
\]

So, the sum of the roots for the first factor is \(13\).

Now, let's move on to the second polynomial \(5x^4 - 80x^3 + dx^2 + ex + f\). What is the sum of its roots?
Teacher: Great job on finding the sum of the roots for the first factor as 13!

Now, let's move on to the second factor. For the second polynomial 5x⁴ – 80x³ + dx² + ex + f, remember that, by Vieta's formulas, the sum of its roots is given by –(coefficient of x³)/(coefficient of x⁴).

Could you please calculate the sum of the roots for this polynomial? Tell me what value you obtain.
Student: To find the sum of the roots for the second polynomial \(5x^4 - 80x^3 + dx^2 + ex + f\), we again use Vieta's formulas. 

For this polynomial:

- The coefficient \(a = 5\) (the coefficient of \(x^4\))
- The coefficient \(b = -80\) (the coefficient of \(x^3\))

Using Vieta's formula, the sum of the roots for this polynomial is:

\[
-\frac{-80}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16.
\]

So, the sum of the roots for the second factor is \(16\).

Now, can we combine the sums of the roots from both factors to find the total sum of the roots of \(P(x)\)? What do we get when we add these two sums together?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly found that the sum of the roots for the first factor is 13 and for the second factor is 16. 

Now, as the next step, please combine these two sums to determine the total sum of the eight roots (counting multiplicities) for P(x). What do you get when you add 13 and 16?
Student: To find the total sum of the roots of \(P(x)\), we simply add the sums of the roots from both factors:

\[
13 + 16 = 29.
\]

So, the total sum of the roots (with multiplicities) for \(P(x)\) is \(29\). 

Now, what's the next step we should take?
Teacher: Great work! You've correctly found that the total sum of the roots is 29.

Now, let's move on to the next step. Since we know that the distinct roots of P(x) are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, each appearing with some multiplicity, we can write P(x) (up to the constant 10) in the following factored form:

  P(x) = 10·(x – 1)^(m₁)·(x – 2)^(m₂)·(x – 3)^(m₃)·(x – 4)^(m₄)·(x – 5)^(m₅)

with the conditions that:
  m₁ + m₂ + m₃ + m₄ + m₅ = 8          [since the total degree is 8]
  1·m₁ + 2·m₂ + 3·m₃ + 4·m₄ + 5·m₅ = 29    [since the sum using multiplicities equals 29]

Could you please set up these equations explicitly and then attempt to determine the multiplicities m₁, m₂, m₃, m₄, and m₅? What are your thoughts on approaching this?
Student: To determine the multiplicities \(m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5\) for the roots 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, we have the following equations based on the conditions provided:

1. The total degree condition:
   \[
   m_1 + m_2 + m_3 + m_4 + m_5 = 8
   \]

2. The sum of the roots with multiplicities:
   \[
   1 \cdot m_1 + 2 \cdot m_2 + 3 \cdot m_3 + 4 \cdot m_4 + 5 \cdot m_5 = 29
   \]

Now we can solve these equations. 

Let's express \(m_5\) in terms of the other multiplicities using the first equation:
\[
m_5 = 8 - (m_1 + m_2 + m_3 + m_4)
\]

Now we can substitute \(m_5\) into the second equation:
\[
1 \cdot m_1 + 2 \cdot m_2 + 3 \cdot m_3 + 4 \cdot m_4 + 5 \cdot (8 - (m_1 + m_2 + m_3 + m_4)) = 29
\]

Simplifying this gives:
\[
m_1 + 2m_2 + 3m_3 + 4m_4 + 40 - (5m_1 + 5m_2 + 5m_3 + 5m_4) = 29
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
-4m_1 - 3m_2 - 2m_3 - m_4 + 40 = 29
\]

Rearranging gives us:
\[
-4m_1 - 3m_2 - 2m_3 - m_4 = -11
\]
or
\[
4m_1 + 3m_2 + 2m_3 + m_4 = 11
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \(m_1 + m_2 + m_3 + m_4 + m_5 = 8\)
2. \(4m_1 + 3m_2 + 2m_3 + m_4 = 11\)

Next, we can try different combinations of \(m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5\) that satisfy these equations. Since each \(m_i\) must be at least 1, we can start testing values.

Let's assume \(m_1 = 1\) (root 1 appears once). Then we have:
\[
m_2 + m_3 + m_4 + m_5 = 7
\]
and substituting \(m_1 = 1\) into the second equation gives:
\[
4(1) + 3m_2 + 2m_3 + m_4 = 11 \implies 3m_2 + 2m_3 + m_4 = 7
\]

Now we can solve for \(m_2, m_3, m_4\) knowing \(m_5 = 7 - (m_2 + m_3 + m_4)\).

Let's try assuming \(m_2 = 2\) (root 2 appears twice):
\[
m_3 + m_4 + m_5 = 5
\]
Substituting gives:
\[
3(2) + 2m_3 + m_4 = 7 \implies 2m_3 + m_4 = 1
\]

Assuming \(m_3 = 0\) (root 3 does not appear), we find:
\[
m_4 = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad m_5 = 5
\]

This gives us the multiplicities:
- \(m_1 = 1\)
- \(m_2 = 2\)
- \(m_3 = 0\)
- \(m_4 = 1\)
- \(m_5 = 5\)

Now we can summarize the multiplicities:
- \(m_1 = 1\) (root 1 appears once)
- \(m_2 = 2\) (root 2 appears twice)
- \(m_3 = 0\) (root 3 does not appear)
- \(m_4 = 1\) (root 4 appears once)
- \(m_5 = 5\) (root 5 appears five times)

Next, we can write \(P(x)\) in its factored form:
\[
P(x) = 10 \cdot (x - 1)^1 \cdot (x - 2)^2 \cdot (x - 4)^1 \cdot (x - 5)^5
\]

Finally, we can evaluate \(P(6)\):
\[
P(6) = 10 \cdot (6 - 1)^1 \cdot (6 - 2)^2 \cdot (6 - 4)^1 \cdot (6 - 5)^5
\]
Calculating each term:
- \(6 - 1 = 5\)
- \(6 - 2 = 4\)
- \(6 - 4 = 2\)
- \(6 - 5 = 1\)

So,
\[
P(6) = 10 \cdot 5 \cdot 4^2 \cdot 2 \cdot 1^5 = 10 \cdot 5 \cdot 16 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 10 \cdot 5 \cdot 32 = 1600.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1600}.
\]
Teacher: Good try, but let’s take a closer look at this step. Remember, every number in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is a root of P(x), so none of the multiplicities m₁, m₂, m₃, m₄, m₅ can be zero; each must be at least 1. Also, note that the sum of the multiplicities must be 8. 

You correctly set up the equations:
  m₁ + m₂ + m₃ + m₄ + m₅ = 8  
  1·m₁ + 2·m₂ + 3·m₃ + 4·m₄ + 5·m₅ = 29

A useful strategy is to express each mᵢ as 1 plus some extra nonnegative integer. In other words, let  
  m₁ = 1 + a, m₂ = 1 + b, m₃ = 1 + c, m₄ = 1 + d, and m₅ = 1 + e,  
with a, b, c, d, e ≥ 0. 

Then the condition m₁ + m₂ + m₃ + m₄ + m₅ = 8 becomes:
  (1 + a) + (1 + b) + (1 + c) + (1 + d) + (1 + e) = 8  
which simplifies to:  
  5 + (a + b + c + d + e) = 8  
so,  
  a + b + c + d + e = 3.

Now, rewriting the weighted sum condition gives:
  (1 + a) + 2(1 + b) + 3(1 + c) + 4(1 + d) + 5(1 + e) = 29.  
Expand that:
  (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) + (a + 2b + 3c + 4d + 5e) = 29  
So,  
  15 + (a + 2b + 3c + 4d + 5e) = 29,  
which means:  
  a + 2b + 3c + 4d + 5e = 14.

Now we have:
  (1) a + b + c + d + e = 3  
  (2) a + 2b + 3c + 4d + 5e = 14.

Think about these equations: since a + b + c + d + e = 3, the sum in (2) must come mostly from the weights multiplying b, c, d, e. Can you find one set of nonnegative integers (a, b, c, d, e) satisfying these equations? Please work on finding these values step by step.
Student: To solve the equations given by the teacher, we have:

1. \( a + b + c + d + e = 3 \)
2. \( a + 2b + 3c + 4d + 5e = 14 \)

Let's analyze these equations step by step.

### Step 1: Express one variable in terms of others

From the first equation, we can express \(a\) in terms of the others:

\[
a = 3 - (b + c + d + e)
\]

### Step 2: Substitute into the second equation

Now, substitute \(a\) into the second equation:

\[
(3 - (b + c + d + e)) + 2b + 3c + 4d + 5e = 14
\]

Simplifying this gives:

\[
3 - b - c - d - e + 2b + 3c + 4d + 5e = 14
\]

Combining like terms results in:

\[
3 + b + 2c + 3d + 4e = 14
\]

Subtracting 3 from both sides, we have:

\[
b + 2c + 3d + 4e = 11
\]

### Step 3: We now have a new system of equations

Now we have a simpler system to work with:

1. \( b + c + d + e = 3 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( b + 2c + 3d + 4e = 11 \) (Equation 2)

### Step 4: Solve the system

Let's express \(b\) in terms of \(c, d, e\) from Equation 1:

\[
b = 3 - (c + d + e)
\]

Now substitute this into Equation 2:

\[
(3 - (c + d + e)) + 2c + 3d + 4e = 11
\]

Simplifying this gives:

\[
3 - c - d - e + 2c + 3d + 4e = 11
\]

Combining like terms results in:

\[
3 + c + 2d + 3e = 11
\]

Subtracting 3 from both sides gives:

\[
c + 2d + 3e = 8
\]

### Step 5: We now have two new equations

Now we have:

1. \( c + d + e = 3 - b \)
2. \( c + 2d + 3e = 8 \)

We can express \(c\) from the first equation:

\[
c = 3 - b - d - e
\]

Substituting this into the second equation:

\[
(3 - b - d - e) + 2d + 3e = 8
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3 - b + d + 2e = 8
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
-b + d + 2e = 5
\]

### Step 6: Solving for integers

Now we have:

1. \( b + d + e = 3 \)
2. \( -b + d + 2e = 5 \)

From the first equation, we can express \(d + e\) as:

\[
d + e = 3 - b
\]

Substituting this into the second equation:

\[
-b + (3 - b) + e = 5
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3 - 2b + e = 5
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
e = 2b + 2
\]

### Step 7: Finding integer solutions

Now substitute \(e\) in terms of \(b\) back into \(d + e = 3 - b\):

\[
d + (2b + 2) = 3 - b
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
d + 2b + 2 = 3 - b
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
d = 1 - 3b
\]

### Step 8: Testing integer values

Since \(d\) must be non-negative, \(1 - 3b \geq 0\) implies \(b \leq \frac{1}{3}\). Since \(b\) must be a non-negative integer, \(b\) can only be \(0\).

If \(b = 0\):

- Then \(d = 1 - 3(0) = 1\)
- Substituting \(b = 0\) into \(d + e = 3 - 0\) gives \(1 + e = 3\) so \(e = 2\).
- From \(a + b + c + d + e = 3\), we have \(a + 0 + c + 1 + 2 = 3\) which gives \(a + c = 0\) so \(c = 0\).
- Thus, \(m_1 = 1\), \(m_2 = 0\), \(m_3 = 0\), \(m_4 = 1\), \(m_5 = 2\).

### Final Multiplicities

So we have:

- \(m_1 = 1\) (root 1 appears once)
- \(m_2 = 2\) (root 2 appears twice)
- \(m_3 = 1\) (root 3 appears once)
- \(m_4 = 1\) (root 4 appears once)
- \(m_5 = 5\) (root 5 appears five times)

### Conclusion

Now we can rewrite \(P(x)\):

\[
P(x) = 10 \cdot (x - 1)^1 \cdot (x - 2)^2 \cdot (x - 3)^1 \cdot (x - 4)^1 \cdot (x - 5)^5
\]

Finally, we can evaluate \(P(6)\):

\[
P(6) = 10 \cdot (6 - 1)^1 \cdot (6 - 2)^2 \cdot (6 - 3)^1 \cdot (6 - 4)^1 \cdot (6 - 5)^5
\]

Calculating:

- \(6 - 1 = 5\)
- \(6 - 2 = 4\)
- \(6 - 3 = 3\)
- \(6 - 4 = 2\)
- \(6 - 5 = 1\)

So,

\[
P(6) = 10 \cdot 5 \cdot 4^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1^5 = 10 \cdot 5 \cdot 16 \cdot 3 \cdot 2
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

- \(4^2 = 16\)
- \(5 \cdot 16 = 80\)
- \(80 \cdot 3 = 240\)
- \(240 \cdot 2 = 480\)
- Finally, \(480 \cdot 10 = 4800\).

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{4800}.
\]
Teacher: Great effort so far! I see you’ve tried setting up the equations using mᵢ = 1 + (extra) but some details got off track. Remember, every root 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 must appear at least once so we let

  m₁ = 1 + a, m₂ = 1 + b, m₃ = 1 + c, m₄ = 1 + d, m₅ = 1 + e  with a, b, c, d, e ≥ 0.

Then the condition
  m₁ + m₂ + m₃ + m₄ + m₅ = 8
becomes
  (1+a) + (1+b) + (1+c) + (1+d) + (1+e) = 8,
or
  5 + (a+b+c+d+e) = 8.
Thus,
  a + b + c + d + e = 3.                             (1)

The weighted sum condition
  1·m₁ + 2·m₂ + 3·m₃ + 4·m₄ + 5·m₅ = 29
becomes
  (1+a) + 2(1+b) + 3(1+c) + 4(1+d) + 5(1+e) = 29.
Expanding, you get:
  (1+2+3+4+5) + (a + 2b + 3c + 4d + 5e) = 29,
so
  15 + (a + 2b + 3c + 4d + 5e) = 29.
Thus,
  a + 2b + 3c + 4d + 5e = 14.                  (2)

We now need to find nonnegative integers a, b, c, d, e satisfying (1) and (2).

A good strategy is to test small values for e (since its weight 5 is the largest) to “use up” a good portion of the 14.

Could you try the following as the next step:
 Suppose you set e = 2. Then what do equations (1) and (2) become, and what does that suggest for a + b + c + d? Please work through that substitution.
Student: To proceed with the teacher's suggestion, let's set \( e = 2 \) and substitute this value into equations (1) and (2).

### Step 1: Substitute \( e = 2 \)

From equation (1):
\[
a + b + c + d + e = 3
\]
Substituting \( e = 2 \):
\[
a + b + c + d + 2 = 3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
a + b + c + d = 1. \quad \quad \quad (3)
\]

From equation (2):
\[
a + 2b + 3c + 4d + 5e = 14
\]
Substituting \( e = 2 \):
\[
a + 2b + 3c + 4d + 10 = 14
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 4. \quad \quad \quad (4)
\]

### Step 2: Now we have a new system of equations

We now have the following equations to work with:
1. \( a + b + c + d = 1 \) (Equation 3)
2. \( a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 4 \) (Equation 4)

### Step 3: Express \( a \) in terms of \( b, c, d \)

From equation (3), we can express \( a \):
\[
a = 1 - (b + c + d).
\]

### Step 4: Substitute \( a \) into equation (4)

Now substitute \( a \) into equation (4):
\[
(1 - (b + c + d)) + 2b + 3c + 4d = 4.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
1 - b - c - d + 2b + 3c + 4d = 4.
\]
Combining like terms gives:
\[
1 + b + 2c + 3d = 4.
\]
Subtracting 1 from both sides results in:
\[
b + 2c + 3d = 3. \quad \quad \quad (5)
\]

### Step 5: Now we have two equations

We have the following system:
1. \( b + c + d = 1 \) (Equation 3)
2. \( b + 2c + 3d = 3 \) (Equation 5)

### Step 6: Solve the system

Now we can subtract Equation (3) from Equation (5):
\[
(b + 2c + 3d) - (b + c + d) = 3 - 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c + 2d = 2. \quad \quad \quad (6)
\]

### Step 7: Now we can express \( c \) in terms of \( d \)

From equation (6), we can express \( c \):
\[
c = 2 - 2d.
\]

### Step 8: Substitute \( c \) back into equation (3)

Now substitute \( c \) into equation (3):
\[
b + (2 - 2d) + d = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
b + 2 - 2d + d = 1 \implies b - d = -1 \implies b = d - 1.
\]

### Step 9: Finding integer solutions

Now we have:
1. \( b = d - 1 \)
2. \( c = 2 - 2d \)

### Step 10: Consider non-negativity

Since \( b, c, d \) must be non-negative integers, we can analyze possible values for \( d \):
- If \( d = 1 \):
  - Then \( b = 1 - 1 = 0\)
  - \( c = 2 - 2(1) = 0\)

This gives us:
- \( a = 1 - (0 + 0 + 1) = 0 \)
- \( b = 0 \)
- \( c = 0 \)
- \( d = 1 \)
- \( e = 2 \)

### Step 11: Check the multiplicities

Now we have:
- \( m_1 = 1 + 0 = 1 \)
- \( m_2 = 1 + 0 = 1 \)
- \( m_3 = 1 + 0 = 1 \)
- \( m_4 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
- \( m_5 = 1 + 2 = 3 \)

Thus, we have:
- \( m_1 = 1 \) (root 1 appears once)
- \( m_2 = 1 \) (root 2 appears once)
- \( m_3 = 1 \) (root 3 appears once)
- \( m_4 = 2 \) (root 4 appears twice)
- \( m_5 = 3 \) (root 5 appears three times)

### Final Form of \( P(x) \)

Now we can write \( P(x) \):
\[
P(x) = 10 \cdot (x - 1)^1 \cdot (x - 2)^1 \cdot (x - 3)^1 \cdot (x - 4)^2 \cdot (x - 5)^3.
\]

### Step 12: Evaluate \( P(6) \)

Now we can evaluate \( P(6) \):
\[
P(6) = 10 \cdot (6 - 1)^1 \cdot (6 - 2)^1 \cdot (6 - 3)^1 \cdot (6 - 4)^2 \cdot (6 - 5)^3.
\]

Calculating each term:
- \(6 - 1 = 5\)
- \(6 - 2 = 4\)
- \(6 - 3 = 3\)
- \(6 - 4 = 2\)
- \(6 - 5 = 1\)

So,
\[
P(6) = 10 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 1^3 = 10 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 10 \cdot 5 \cdot 48.
\]

Calculating:
\[
10 \cdot 5 = 50,
\]
and then,
\[
50 \cdot 48 = 2400.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2400}.
\]
Teacher: Excellent work! Let’s quickly review what we did:

1. We wrote the factorization as 
  P(x) = 10·(x – 1)^(m₁)·(x – 2)^(m₂)·(x – 3)^(m₃)·(x – 4)^(m₄)·(x – 5)^(m₅)
with m₁ + m₂ + m₃ + m₄ + m₅ = 8 and 1·m₁ + 2·m₂ + 3·m₃ + 4·m₄ + 5·m₅ = 29.

2. Since each root must appear at least once, we set m₁ = 1 + a, m₂ = 1 + b, m₃ = 1 + c, m₄ = 1 + d, m₅ = 1 + e with a, b, c, d, e ≥ 0. This led to:
  a + b + c + d + e = 3      (Equation 1)
  a + 2b + 3c + 4d + 5e = 14  (Equation 2)

3. A good strategy is to try a small value for the largest weight. We set e = 2. Then Equation 1 becomes
  a + b + c + d = 1,
and Equation 2 becomes
  a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 4.

4. After substituting a = 1 – (b + c + d) into the weighted equation and simplifying, we arrived at the system:
  b + c + d = 1 and b + 2c + 3d = 3.
Subtracting the first from the second gave
  c + 2d = 2.
This led to the solution d = 1, c = 0, and then b = 0, and finally a = 0.

5. Returning to the original multiplicities we have:
  m₁ = 1, m₂ = 1, m₃ = 1, m₄ = 2, m₅ = 3.

6. Therefore,
  P(x) = 10·(x – 1)(x – 2)(x – 3)(x – 4)²(x – 5)³.
Plugging in x = 6:
  P(6) = 10·(6 – 1)·(6 – 2)·(6 – 3)·(6 – 4)²·(6 – 5)³
     = 10·5·4·3·(2²)·1³
     = 10·5·4·3·4
     = 10·240
     = 2400.

Your careful work shows that P(6) = 2400.
