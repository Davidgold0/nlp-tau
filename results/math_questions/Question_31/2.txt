Question: The equation $x^2-6x+2=29$ has two solutions, $a$ and $b$, with $a\geq b$. What is the value of $2a-3b$?
Teacher: Let's begin by restating the problem in our own words: We have the equation x² - 6x + 2 = 29, and we need to find its two solutions (calling the larger one a and the smaller one b). Then, we must calculate the value of 2a - 3b. 

A good way to start is to rearrange the equation into standard quadratic form. What do you get when you subtract 29 from both sides of the equation? Please show your work for this step.
Student: Sure! Let's start by rearranging the equation \( x^2 - 6x + 2 = 29 \) into standard quadratic form.

First, we subtract 29 from both sides of the equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 2 - 29 = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 6x - 27 = 0
\]

Now we have the equation in standard quadratic form, which is \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -6 \), and \( c = -27 \). 

What should we do next?
Teacher: Great job rearranging the equation into standard quadratic form! Now that we have x² - 6x - 27 = 0, the next step is to solve for x by factoring the quadratic (if possible) or by using the quadratic formula. 

Let’s try factoring first. Can you determine two numbers that multiply to -27 and add up to -6? Please show your work for this step.
Student: Student: Thank you! Let's see if we can factor the equation \( x^2 - 6x - 27 = 0 \).

We need two numbers that multiply to \(-27\) (the constant term) and add up to \(-6\) (the coefficient of \(x\)). 

To find these numbers, we can list the pairs of factors of \(-27\):

- \(1\) and \(-27\) (sum = -26)
- \(-1\) and \(27\) (sum = 26)
- \(3\) and \(-9\) (sum = -6)
- \(-3\) and \(9\) (sum = 6)

The pair that works is \(3\) and \(-9\) because \(3 \times -9 = -27\) and \(3 + (-9) = -6\).

So we can factor the quadratic as:

\[
(x - 9)(x + 3) = 0
\]

What should I do next?
Teacher: Great work factoring the equation! Now that you have (x - 9)(x + 3) = 0, the next step is to find the two solutions by setting each factor equal to zero. Could you please solve for x in each case and then identify which solution is a (the larger one) and which is b (the smaller one)? Provide your work for this step.
Student: Sure! Let's solve for \(x\) by setting each factor equal to zero.

1. For the first factor \(x - 9 = 0\):
   \[
   x = 9
   \]

2. For the second factor \(x + 3 = 0\):
   \[
   x = -3
   \]

Now we have the two solutions: \(x = 9\) and \(x = -3\). Since we defined \(a\) as the larger solution and \(b\) as the smaller solution, we have:

- \(a = 9\)
- \(b = -3\)

What should I do next?
Teacher: Excellent work so far! You've correctly identified a = 9 and b = -3. The final step is to compute the expression 2a - 3b using these values. 

Please substitute a = 9 and b = -3 into the expression 2a - 3b and show your work for this step.
Student: Thank you! Now let's compute the expression \(2a - 3b\) using the values we found for \(a\) and \(b\).

We have:
- \(a = 9\)
- \(b = -3\)

Now we substitute these values into the expression:

\[
2a - 3b = 2(9) - 3(-3)
\]

Calculating each part:
\[
2(9) = 18
\]
\[
3(-3) = -9 \quad \text{(so } -3(-3) = 9\text{)}
\]

Now substituting these values back into the expression:
\[
2a - 3b = 18 + 9 = 27
\]

Thus, the value of \(2a - 3b\) is \(\boxed{27}\).
Teacher: Great job on arriving at your answer! Let's summarize what we did:

1. We rewrote the equation as x² - 6x - 27 = 0.
2. We factored it into (x - 9)(x + 3) = 0.
3. We solved for x, giving x = 9 and x = -3 (with a = 9 and b = -3).
4. We substituted these into the expression 2a - 3b to get 2(9) - 3(-3) = 18 + 9 = 27.

Your final answer is 27$
