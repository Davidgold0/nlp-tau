Question: The equation $x^2-6x+2=29$ has two solutions, $a$ and $b$, with $a\geq b$. What is the value of $2a-3b$?
3o-mini: To solve the equation x² - 6x + 2 = 29, first subtract 29 from both sides to obtain:

  x² - 6x + 2 - 29 = 0  
  x² - 6x - 27 = 0

Next, factor the quadratic. Look for two numbers that multiply to -27 and add to -6. The numbers -9 and 3 work since (-9) × 3 = -27 and (-9) + 3 = -6. Thus, the equation factors as:

  (x - 9)(x + 3) = 0

Setting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions:

  x - 9 = 0 ⟹ x = 9  
  x + 3 = 0 ⟹ x = -3

Since the problem states that a ≥ b, we have a = 9 and b = -3.

Now, compute 2a - 3b:

  2(9) - 3(-3) = 18 + 9 = 27

Thus, the value of 2a - 3b is 27.
