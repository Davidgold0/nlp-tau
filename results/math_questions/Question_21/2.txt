Question: Solve for $n$: $|n + 6| = 2 - n$.
Teacher: Let's break down the problem together. We need to solve the equation |n + 6| = 2 – n.

Here’s an outline of the steps we can follow:

1. Consider the expression inside the absolute value. Since absolute value always gives a non-negative result, the right-hand side (2 – n) must be non-negative. So, first, determine the condition on n such that 2 – n ≥ 0.

2. Once we have that condition, we deal with the absolute value by considering the two cases:
   a. Case 1: n + 6 is non-negative. In this case |n + 6| becomes n + 6.
   b. Case 2: n + 6 is negative. In this case |n + 6| becomes –(n + 6).

3. Solve the equation for each case under its corresponding domain condition.

4. Finally, check that the solutions you obtain satisfy any restrictions from step 1 and the conditions in each case.

Now, let's start with the first step: Can you determine the condition on n that must be met so that the right-hand side, 2 – n, is non-negative? What inequality will that give, and what is its solution?
Student: To determine the condition on \( n \) such that \( 2 - n \) is non-negative, we can set up the inequality:

\[
2 - n \geq 0
\]

Now, let's solve this inequality:

1. Add \( n \) to both sides:
   \[
   2 \geq n
   \]

2. This can also be written as:
   \[
   n \leq 2
   \]

So, the condition we found is that \( n \) must be less than or equal to 2. This tells us that for the right-hand side of the equation to be non-negative, \( n \) must satisfy \( n \leq 2 \). 

Would you like me to proceed to the next step, where we consider the two cases for the absolute value?
Teacher: Great work! Your answer for the condition on n is correct: n must be less than or equal to 2.

Now, let’s move on to the next step. We need to consider the two cases for the absolute value. Let's start with Case 1, where the expression inside the absolute value is non-negative. That is, assume n + 6 ≥ 0 (which means n ≥ -6). Under this assumption, the equation |n + 6| = 2 - n becomes:

  n + 6 = 2 - n

Can you solve this equation for n, and then check if the solution you obtain satisfies the conditions n ≥ -6 and n ≤ 2? Please walk me through your steps.
Student: Sure! Let's start solving the equation for Case 1, where we assume \( n + 6 \geq 0 \). This leads us to the equation:

\[
n + 6 = 2 - n
\]

Now, let's solve for \( n \):

1. First, we can add \( n \) to both sides to combine like terms:
   \[
   n + n + 6 = 2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   2n + 6 = 2
   \]

2. Next, we can subtract 6 from both sides:
   \[
   2n = 2 - 6
   \]
   Which simplifies to:
   \[
   2n = -4
   \]

3. Now, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( n \):
   \[
   n = -2
   \]

Now, we need to check if this solution \( n = -2 \) satisfies both conditions: \( n \geq -6 \) and \( n \leq 2 \).

- For the first condition \( n \geq -6 \):
  \[
  -2 \geq -6 \quad \text{(True)}
  \]

- For the second condition \( n \leq 2 \):
  \[
  -2 \leq 2 \quad \text{(True)}
  \]

Since both conditions are satisfied, \( n = -2 \) is a valid solution for Case 1.

Would you like me to move on to Case 2 now?
Teacher: Great work with Case 1! Your steps and reasoning were spot on.

Now, let’s move to Case 2. In Case 2, we assume that the expression inside the absolute value is negative. That gives us the condition:

  n + 6 < 0  or  n < -6.

Under this assumption, the absolute value expression becomes –(n + 6), so the equation becomes:

  –(n + 6) = 2 – n

Now, can you solve this equation for n, and then check if the solution satisfies both n < -6 (the assumption for Case 2) and the overall condition n ≤ 2? Please walk me through your steps for this case.
Student: Sure! Let's solve the equation for Case 2, where we assume \( n + 6 < 0 \). This leads us to the equation:

\[
-(n + 6) = 2 - n
\]

Now let's solve for \( n \):

1. First, we can distribute the negative sign on the left side:
   \[
   -n - 6 = 2 - n
   \]

2. Next, we can add \( n \) to both sides to eliminate \( -n \) from the right side:
   \[
   -6 = 2
   \]

3. Now, we can add 6 to both sides to isolate the constant:
   \[
   0 = 8
   \]

This statement \( 0 = 8 \) is a contradiction, meaning there are no solutions for this case. 

Next, we need to check if there are any possible values of \( n \) that satisfy our original assumptions. Since the assumption \( n + 6 < 0 \) leads to a contradiction, we conclude that there are no valid solutions from Case 2.

To summarize:
- From Case 1, we found a valid solution: \( n = -2 \).
- From Case 2, we found no solutions.

Now we can conclude that the only solution to the original equation \( |n + 6| = 2 - n \) is:

\[
\boxed{-2}
\]

Would you like to go over anything else or check the solution further?
Teacher: Great job working through Case 2! You correctly solved the equation and found that the assumption in Case 2 leads to a contradiction, meaning no solution arises from that branch.

Let's quickly summarize our process:

1. We first ensured that 2 – n is non-negative, giving us n ≤ 2.
2. In Case 1 (assuming n + 6 ≥ 0), you correctly solved n + 6 = 2 – n and found n = -2. Checking the conditions, -2 satisfies both n ≥ -6 and n ≤ 2.
3. In Case 2 (assuming n + 6 < 0), you found a contradiction, so no solution results from that case.

Thus, the only valid solution to the equation is n = -2.

Final answer: -2$
