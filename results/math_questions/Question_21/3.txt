Question: Solve for $n$: $|n + 6| = 2 - n$.
Teacher: Let's start by outlining the steps for solving the equation |n + 6| = 2 – n:

1. Understand that the absolute value equation will lead us to consider two different cases based on the expression inside the absolute value.
2. Case 1: Assume n + 6 is nonnegative (n + 6 ≥ 0). Under this assumption, the equation becomes n + 6 = 2 – n. Solve this equation.
3. Case 2: Assume n + 6 is negative (n + 6 < 0). Under this assumption, the equation becomes –(n + 6) = 2 – n. Solve this equation.
4. In each case, check whether the solution(s) meet the initial assumption of that case.

Let's begin with the first step. For Case 1, assuming n + 6 ≥ 0, please solve the equation n + 6 = 2 – n. What do you get for n in that equation?
Student: To solve the equation for Case 1, where we assume \( n + 6 \geq 0 \), we start with the equation:

\[
n + 6 = 2 - n
\]

Now, let's isolate \( n \). First, we can add \( n \) to both sides:

\[
n + n + 6 = 2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2n + 6 = 2
\]

Next, we subtract 6 from both sides:

\[
2n = 2 - 6
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2n = -4
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 2:

\[
n = -2
\]

So, for Case 1, we found \( n = -2 \). 

Now, we need to check if this solution meets the initial assumption that \( n + 6 \geq 0 \). Let's check:

\[
-2 + 6 = 4 \geq 0
\]

Since this is true, \( n = -2 \) is a valid solution for Case 1. 

Would you like me to move on to Case 2 now?
Teacher: Great job on solving Case 1! Now let’s move on to Case 2.

Recall that in Case 2, we assume n + 6 < 0. With that in mind, the equation becomes:

  –(n + 6) = 2 – n

Please solve this equation step by step for n, and then check if your solution satisfies the assumption n + 6 < 0. What do you get for n in this case?
Student: To solve the equation for Case 2, where we assume \( n + 6 < 0 \), we start with the equation:

\[
-(n + 6) = 2 - n
\]

First, we can simplify the left side:

\[
-n - 6 = 2 - n
\]

Next, we can add \( n \) to both sides to eliminate \( -n \) on the left:

\[
-n - 6 + n = 2 - n + n
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-n - 6 = 2
\]

Now, let's add 6 to both sides:

\[
-n = 2 + 6
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-n = 8
\]

Now, we multiply both sides by -1 to solve for \( n \):

\[
n = -8
\]

Now we need to check if this solution meets the initial assumption that \( n + 6 < 0 \). Let's check:

\[
-8 + 6 = -2 < 0
\]

Since this is true, \( n = -8 \) is a valid solution for Case 2.

Now we have two potential solutions: \( n = -2 \) from Case 1 and \( n = -8 \) from Case 2. Would you like me to summarize the solutions or check something else?
Teacher: Great work on solving both cases! So far, you've determined that:

• In Case 1 (assuming n + 6 ≥ 0), you found n = –2, and it satisfied the condition.
• In Case 2 (assuming n + 6 < 0), you found n = –8, and it met the assumption as well.

Now that you have these two potential solutions, let's combine our results. Considering the restrictions for each case, please provide your final answer for n, including both valid solutions. What final answer do you get?
Student: Based on the solutions we found from both cases:

1. From Case 1, we have \( n = -2 \), which satisfies the condition \( n + 6 \geq 0 \).
2. From Case 2, we have \( n = -8 \), which satisfies the condition \( n + 6 < 0 \).

Since both solutions are valid and meet the conditions of their respective cases, the final answer for \( n \) is:

\[
n = -2 \quad \text{and} \quad n = -8
\]

Thus, the complete solution set is \( n = -2 \) and \( n = -8 \).
Teacher: Excellent work! You've carefully solved both cases and verified the conditions for each. To summarize:

• In Case 1 (assuming n + 6 ≥ 0), you obtained n = –2, and indeed –2 + 6 = 4, which satisfies the condition.
• In Case 2 (assuming n + 6 < 0), you obtained n = –8, and indeed –8 + 6 = –2, which satisfies the condition.

Therefore, considering both results, the complete final solution for n is:

n = –2 and n = –8$
Student: Thank you! To summarize my understanding and the final solution:

1. In Case 1, where we assumed \( n + 6 \geq 0 \), we found \( n = -2 \) and verified that it satisfies the condition since \( -2 + 6 = 4 \geq 0 \).

2. In Case 2, where we assumed \( n + 6 < 0 \), we found \( n = -8 \) and confirmed that it also satisfies the condition since \( -8 + 6 = -2 < 0 \).

Thus, the complete solution set for \( n \) is:

\[
n = -2 \quad \text{and} \quad n = -8
\]

Thank you for guiding me through the steps!
Teacher: Great work summarizing your understanding! Based on our discussion:

• In Case 1, assuming n + 6 ≥ 0, you derived n = -2 and confirmed that -2 + 6 = 4 satisfies the condition.
• In Case 2, assuming n + 6 < 0, you found n = -8, and -8 + 6 = -2 meets the condition.

Thus, the overall solution combining both cases is: 

n = -2 and n = -8$
