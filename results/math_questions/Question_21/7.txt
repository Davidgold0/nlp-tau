Question: Solve for $n$: $|n + 6| = 2 - n$.
3o-mini: We need to solve the equation |n + 6| = 2 - n.

Step 1: Note that the absolute value is always non-negative, so for the equation to hold, the right-hand side 2 - n must be non-negative:
  2 - n ≥ 0 ⟹ n ≤ 2.

Step 2: Consider two cases based on the expression inside the absolute value.

Case 1: (n + 6) is non-negative.
  If n + 6 ≥ 0 then n ≥ -6.
  The equation becomes:
   n + 6 = 2 - n.
  Combine like terms:
   n + n = 2 - 6 ⟹ 2n = -4 ⟹ n = -2.
  Check the conditions:
   n = -2 is ≥ -6 and also ≤ 2. So this is an acceptable solution.

Case 2: (n + 6) is negative.
  If n + 6 < 0 then n < -6.
  The equation becomes:
   -(n + 6) = 2 - n ⟹  -n - 6 = 2 - n.
  Add n to both sides:
    -6 = 2.
  This is a contradiction, so no solution exists in this case.

Thus, the only solution is n = -2.
