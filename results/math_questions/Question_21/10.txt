Question: Solve for $n$: $|n + 6| = 2 - n$.
3o-mini: We start with the equation |n + 6| = 2 - n. 

Step 1: Notice that |n + 6| is always non-negative, so the right side 2 - n must also be non-negative:
  2 - n ≥ 0 ⟹ n ≤ 2.

Step 2: Consider two cases for the absolute value.

Case 1: n + 6 ≥ 0 (i.e., n ≥ -6)
  In this case, |n + 6| = n + 6.
  So the equation becomes:
   n + 6 = 2 - n
  Combine like terms:
   2n + 6 = 2 ⟹ 2n = -4 ⟹ n = -2.
  This solution satisfies n ≥ -6 and n ≤ 2.

Case 2: n + 6 < 0 (i.e., n < -6)
  In this case, |n + 6| = -(n + 6) = -n - 6.
  So the equation becomes:
   -n - 6 = 2 - n
  Add n to both sides:
   -6 = 2.
  This is a contradiction, so there is no solution in this case.

Thus, the only solution is n = -2.
