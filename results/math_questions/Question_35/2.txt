Question: Find all solutions to the equation\[ \sqrt[4]{x} = \frac{12}{7 - \sqrt[4]{x}}.\]
Teacher: Let's start by rephrasing the problem in simpler terms and outlining the steps we need to take.

We have the equation: 
  √[4]{x} = 12 / (7 - √[4]{x}).

One helpful idea is to let u = √[4]{x}. Then our equation becomes:
  u = 12 / (7 - u).

Here’s the plan:
1. Make the substitution u = √[4]{x}.
2. Multiply both sides by (7 - u) to clear the fraction (remember that 7 - u ≠ 0).
3. Expand and rearrange the resulting equation to form a quadratic equation in terms of u.
4. Solve the quadratic equation.
5. Check the solutions to ensure they are valid given our substitution (keep in mind u must be nonnegative).
6. Convert back to x if needed by solving u = √[4]{x}.

Now, please take the first step: After letting u = √[4]{x}, multiply both sides of u = 12/(7 - u) by (7 - u) to get rid of the fraction. Could you show me what that equation looks like after you do that?
Student: Sure! Starting with the equation:

\[ u = \frac{12}{7 - u}, \]

when we multiply both sides by \( (7 - u) \), we get:

\[ u(7 - u) = 12. \]

Now, let's distribute \( u \) on the left side:

\[ 7u - u^2 = 12. \]

This gives us the equation:

\[ 7u - u^2 = 12. \]

Next, we can rearrange it to form a standard quadratic equation. Shall I go ahead and move all terms to one side?
Teacher: Good job! Now, please move all terms to one side to write the quadratic in standard form. What equation do you get after moving all terms?
Student: Sure! Starting from the equation:

\[ 7u - u^2 = 12, \]

I will move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero. This gives us:

\[ -u^2 + 7u - 12 = 0. \]

To write it in standard form, I can multiply through by -1:

\[ u^2 - 7u + 12 = 0. \]

Now we have the quadratic equation in standard form:

\[ u^2 - 7u + 12 = 0. \]

What should I do next?
Teacher: Great work so far! We now have the quadratic equation

  u² – 7u + 12 = 0.

The next step is to factor this quadratic equation. Think about two numbers that multiply to give 12 and add up to –7. Could you try to factor the equation and tell me what factors you find?
Student: Sure! We need to factor the quadratic equation:

\[ u^2 - 7u + 12 = 0. \]

We are looking for two numbers that multiply to 12 and add up to -7. The numbers that work are -3 and -4, since:

- (-3) * (-4) = 12
- (-3) + (-4) = -7

So we can factor the equation as:

\[ (u - 3)(u - 4) = 0. \]

Now, we can set each factor equal to zero to find the solutions for \( u \). Would you like me to do that?
Teacher: Great job factoring the quadratic as (u – 3)(u – 4) = 0! Now, please take the next step: set each factor equal to zero to solve for u. What values of u do you find? Remember, later you'll need to convert these u-values back to x using u = √[4]{x}. Please proceed with finding u.
Student: Sure! We have the factored equation:

\[
(u - 3)(u - 4) = 0.
\]

Now, I will set each factor equal to zero:

1. For the first factor:
   \[
   u - 3 = 0 \implies u = 3.
   \]

2. For the second factor:
   \[
   u - 4 = 0 \implies u = 4.
   \]

So, the values of \( u \) that we found are \( u = 3 \) and \( u = 4 \). 

Next, I will convert these \( u \)-values back to \( x \) using the substitution \( u = \sqrt[4]{x} \). Should I go ahead and do that?
Teacher: Excellent work so far! Now we need to convert our u-values back to x using the original substitution u = √[4]{x}. This means that x = u⁴.

Could you please take the u-values you found (u = 3 and u = 4) and compute the corresponding x-values? What do you get for x?
Student: Sure! I will use the substitution \( x = u^4 \) to find the corresponding x-values for the u-values we found.

1. For \( u = 3 \):
   \[
   x = 3^4 = 81.
   \]

2. For \( u = 4 \):
   \[
   x = 4^4 = 256.
   \]

So the corresponding x-values are \( x = 81 \) and \( x = 256 \).

Next, should I check if these solutions are valid given our original equation?
Teacher: Excellent work so far! You've correctly found x = 81 and x = 256. Now, let's complete the process by checking if these solutions are valid for the original equation. 

Remember that we originally had √[4]{x} = 12⁄(7 – √[4]{x}). So what we need to do now is substitute each solution for x back into the original equation to confirm they work (also ensuring that 7 - √[4]{x} ≠ 0). 

Could you please proceed by checking one of the values (pick either x = 81 or x = 256) to verify it satisfies the original equation?
Student: Sure! Let's check the solution \( x = 81 \) first.

1. We start by calculating \( \sqrt[4]{81} \):
   \[
   \sqrt[4]{81} = \sqrt[4]{3^4} = 3.
   \]

2. Now we'll substitute \( \sqrt[4]{x} = 3 \) into the original equation:
   \[
   3 = \frac{12}{7 - 3}.
   \]

3. Simplifying the right side:
   \[
   7 - 3 = 4 \quad \text{so} \quad \frac{12}{4} = 3.
   \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 81 \) is a valid solution.

Now, let's check the second solution \( x = 256 \):

1. We calculate \( \sqrt[4]{256} \):
   \[
   \sqrt[4]{256} = \sqrt[4]{4^4} = 4.
   \]

2. Substituting \( \sqrt[4]{x} = 4 \) into the original equation:
   \[
   4 = \frac{12}{7 - 4}.
   \]

3. Simplifying the right side:
   \[
   7 - 4 = 3 \quad \text{so} \quad \frac{12}{3} = 4.
   \]

Again, both sides of the equation are equal, so \( x = 256 \) is also a valid solution.

In conclusion, both solutions \( x = 81 \) and \( x = 256 \) are valid for the original equation. Would you like me to summarize the final results?
Teacher: Great job working through the verification! Let's summarize what we've done:

1. We set u = √[4]{x} so that the equation became u = 12/(7 – u).
2. We cleared the fraction by multiplying both sides by (7 – u) to get u(7 – u) = 12.
3. We rearranged the equation to form the quadratic –u² + 7u – 12 = 0, and then multiplied by –1 to obtain u² – 7u + 12 = 0.
4. We factored the quadratic as (u – 3)(u – 4) = 0, yielding solutions u = 3 and u = 4.
5. Converting back, we used x = u⁴ to get x = 3⁴ = 81 and x = 4⁴ = 256.
6. Finally, by substituting these values back into the original equation, we confirmed that both solutions work.

So the final solutions to the equation are x = 81 and x = 256$
Student: Sure! Here’s a summary of the steps we took to solve the equation:

1. We started with the equation \( \sqrt[4]{x} = \frac{12}{7 - \sqrt[4]{x}} \) and made the substitution \( u = \sqrt[4]{x} \).
2. We cleared the fraction by multiplying both sides by \( (7 - u) \), resulting in \( u(7 - u) = 12 \).
3. We expanded and rearranged this to form the quadratic equation \( u^2 - 7u + 12 = 0 \).
4. We factored the quadratic into \( (u - 3)(u - 4) = 0 \), giving us the solutions \( u = 3 \) and \( u = 4 \).
5. We converted these back to \( x \) using \( x = u^4 \), which gave us \( x = 81 \) for \( u = 3 \) and \( x = 256 \) for \( u = 4 \).
6. Finally, we verified both solutions by substituting them back into the original equation, confirming that both \( x = 81 \) and \( x = 256 \) are valid solutions.

So the final solutions to the equation are \( x = 81 \) and \( x = 256 \). Thank you for guiding me through the process!
Teacher: Excellent work! You've successfully verified that both x = 81 and x = 256 satisfy the original equation. 

The final solutions to the equation are:
  x = 81 and x = 256$
