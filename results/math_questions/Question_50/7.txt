Question: If $F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c \times d$, what is the value of $x$ such that $F(2, x, 4, 11) = 300$?
3o-mini: We are given F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + (c × d). Plugging in the values:

F(2, x, 4, 11) = 2^x + (4 × 11) = 2^x + 44

We are told that F(2, x, 4, 11) = 300, so:

2^x + 44 = 300

Subtract 44 from both sides:

2^x = 256

Find x such that 2^x = 256. Since 2^8 = 256, we conclude that:

x = 8
