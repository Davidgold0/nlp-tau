Question: If $F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c \times d$, what is the value of $x$ such that $F(2, x, 4, 11) = 300$?
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem step by step.

We’re given:
 F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c × d
and we need to find the value of x such that:
 F(2, x, 4, 11) = 300.

Step 1: Replace the parameters in the function with the given numbers. That will give you an equation involving x.

What equation do you get when you substitute the values into F? Please show your work for just this step.
Student: Sure! Let's substitute the given values into the function \( F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c \times d \).

We have:
- \( a = 2 \)
- \( b = x \)
- \( c = 4 \)
- \( d = 11 \)

Now, substituting these values into the function gives us:

\[
F(2, x, 4, 11) = 2^x + 4 \times 11
\]

Next, we can simplify \( 4 \times 11 \):

\[
4 \times 11 = 44
\]

So, we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
F(2, x, 4, 11) = 2^x + 44
\]

Now we set this equal to 300, as given in the problem:

\[
2^x + 44 = 300
\]

This is the equation we need to solve for \( x \). Would you like me to proceed with solving for \( x \)?
Teacher: Great job substituting the numbers and setting up the equation! Now, as the next step, you should isolate the expression with the exponential term by removing the constant term. 

So, starting from:
 2^x + 44 = 300

What do you get when you subtract 44 from both sides? Please show your calculation for this step.
Student: Sure! Starting from the equation:

\[
2^x + 44 = 300
\]

we need to isolate \( 2^x \) by subtracting 44 from both sides. 

So, we perform the calculation:

\[
2^x = 300 - 44
\]

Calculating the right side gives us:

\[
2^x = 256
\]

Now we have the equation \( 2^x = 256 \). Would you like me to proceed with solving for \( x \) from here?
Teacher: You've done a fantastic job so far isolating the exponential term! We now have the equation:

  2^x = 256

The next step is to determine which power of 2 gives us 256. Think about the powers of 2: 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, and so on. Can you figure out which exponent leads to 256? Please show your reasoning on this step.
Student: Thank you! To find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2^x = 256 \), we can look at the powers of 2.

We know that:
- \( 2^1 = 2 \)
- \( 2^2 = 4 \)
- \( 2^3 = 8 \)
- \( 2^4 = 16 \)
- \( 2^5 = 32 \)
- \( 2^6 = 64 \)
- \( 2^7 = 128 \)
- \( 2^8 = 256 \)

From this, we see that \( 2^8 = 256 \). 

Therefore, we can conclude that:

\[
x = 8
\]

Would you like me to summarize the solution or provide any further details?
Teacher: Great work! You've carefully substituted the values, isolated the exponential term, and identified the correct power that makes the equation true. Your reasoning shows that 2^x = 256 leads to x = 8. 

To summarize our process:
1. We substituted into F(2, x, 4, 11) to get the equation 2^x + 44 = 300.
2. We isolated 2^x by subtracting 44, resulting in 2^x = 256.
3. We recognized that 2^8 = 256, thus arriving at x = 8.

Final answer:
8$
