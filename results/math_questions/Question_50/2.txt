Question: If $F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c \times d$, what is the value of $x$ such that $F(2, x, 4, 11) = 300$?
Teacher: Let's begin by restating the problem in our own words and outlining the steps we need to follow.

The function is given as F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c × d. We need to determine the value of x such that F(2, x, 4, 11) equals 300.

To approach this problem, here are the steps we might take:
1. Substitute a = 2, b = x, c = 4, and d = 11 into the function. This will give you an expression in terms of x.
2. Set the expression equal to 300.
3. Simplify the resulting equation as much as possible (hint: first compute any constant products).
4. Isolate the expression containing x (which will involve the exponential term).
5. Solve the simplified equation for x.

Let's start with the first step. Please substitute the given values into the function F(a, b, c, d) to write the equation. What equation do you get after substitution?
Student: Sure! After substituting the values \( a = 2 \), \( b = x \), \( c = 4 \), and \( d = 11 \) into the function \( F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c \times d \), we get:

\[
F(2, x, 4, 11) = 2^x + 4 \times 11
\]

Now, let's calculate \( 4 \times 11 \):

\[
4 \times 11 = 44
\]

So, the equation becomes:

\[
F(2, x, 4, 11) = 2^x + 44
\]

Now we can set this equal to 300:

\[
2^x + 44 = 300
\]

What should we do next?
Teacher: That's a great start! You correctly substituted the values and set up the equation as:

  2^x + 44 = 300

For the next step, try isolating the exponential term. What operation will you perform on both sides of the equation, and what equation do you get for 2^x?
Student: To isolate the exponential term \(2^x\), I will subtract 44 from both sides of the equation. 

Starting with the equation:

\[
2^x + 44 = 300
\]

I subtract 44 from both sides:

\[
2^x = 300 - 44
\]

Calculating the right side gives:

\[
2^x = 256
\]

Now we have the equation:

\[
2^x = 256
\]

What should I do next to solve for \(x\)?
Teacher: Excellent work isolating the term to get 2^x = 256.

Now, think about this: how can you express 256 as a power of 2? What exponent on 2 gives you 256? Please determine that exponent so we can equate it to x.
Student: To express 256 as a power of 2, I can recall that:

\[
2^8 = 256
\]

This means that \(x\) must equal 8 because:

\[
2^x = 2^8
\]

So, equating the exponents gives us:

\[
x = 8
\]

Thus, the value of \(x\) that satisfies the equation \(F(2, x, 4, 11) = 300\) is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\] 

Is there anything else you would like to discuss or clarify about this problem?
Teacher: Great job working through the problem! You've correctly substituted the values, isolated the exponential term, and recognized that 256 can be expressed as 2⁸, leading you to the conclusion that x = 8.

Final answer: 8$
