Question: If $F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c \times d$, what is the value of $x$ such that $F(2, x, 4, 11) = 300$?
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem. We have the function F defined as F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c × d, and we're asked to find the value of x such that F(2, x, 4, 11) = 300.

Step 1: Substitute the given values into the function. This means writing out F(2, x, 4, 11) in full. Could you show how you would substitute these numbers into the expression? What does F(2, x, 4, 11) become in terms of x?
Student: Sure! To substitute the values into the function \( F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c \times d \), we replace \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \) with the values given in the problem.

So, substituting \( a = 2 \), \( b = x \), \( c = 4 \), and \( d = 11 \), we have:

\[
F(2, x, 4, 11) = 2^x + 4 \times 11
\]

Now, we can simplify \( 4 \times 11 \):

\[
4 \times 11 = 44
\]

Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
F(2, x, 4, 11) = 2^x + 44
\]

Is that correct?
Teacher: You're absolutely right! Your substitution is perfect. You correctly replaced a with 2, b with x, c with 4, and d with 11, and simplified 4 × 11 to 44, so the expression becomes 2^x + 44.

Now, for the next step, remember that we're given F(2, x, 4, 11) = 300. That means you have the equation:

  2^x + 44 = 300

What would be your next step to isolate 2^x? Please share your work on this step.
Student: Student: Thank you! To isolate \( 2^x \) in the equation \( 2^x + 44 = 300 \), we need to subtract 44 from both sides of the equation. 

So, let's do that:

\[
2^x + 44 - 44 = 300 - 44
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2^x = 256
\]

Now that we have \( 2^x = 256 \), what should I do next to find the value of \( x \)?
Teacher: Great work! You correctly isolated 2^x and found that 2^x = 256. 

Now, the next step is to determine the value of x. To do that, you'll need to ask yourself: which power of 2 gives 256? 

Please use your reasoning to find the exponent x in 2^x = 256. What do you get?
Student: Student: Thank you! To find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2^x = 256 \), I need to determine which power of 2 equals 256.

I know that:

\[
2^8 = 256
\]

Therefore, \( x = 8 \).

So, the value of \( x \) such that \( F(2, x, 4, 11) = 300 \) is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly identified that when you substitute the values into F(2, x, 4, 11), you get the expression 2^x + 44, and then by setting 2^x + 44 = 300, you isolated 2^x as 256. Recognizing that 2^8 = 256, you have found that x = 8.

Summarizing our process:
1. Substitute the given values into the function to get 2^x + 44.
2. Set up the equation 2^x + 44 = 300.
3. Subtract 44 from both sides to isolate 2^x, resulting in 2^x = 256.
4. Recognize that 2 raised to the power 8 equals 256, so x = 8.

Your final answer is:

8$
