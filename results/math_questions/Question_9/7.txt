Question: A sequence $a_1,$ $a_2,$ $a_3,$ $\dots,$ is defined recursively by $a_1 = 1,$ $a_2 = 1,$ and for $k \ge 3,$_x000D_
\[a_k = \frac{1}{3} a_{k - 1} + \frac{1}{4} a_{k - 2}.\]Evaluate $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dotsb.$
3o-mini: We are given the sequence defined by

  a₁ = 1, a₂ = 1,  
  and for k ≥ 3, aₖ = (1/3)aₖ₋₁ + (1/4)aₖ₋₂.

We wish to evaluate the infinite sum S = a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + ⋯.

Step 1. Write the sum and separate the first two terms:

  S = a₁ + a₂ + ∑ₖ₌₃∞ aₖ  
    = 1 + 1 + ∑ₖ₌₃∞ aₖ  
    = 2 + ∑ₖ₌₃∞ aₖ.

Step 2. Use the recurrence relation for k ≥ 3:

  ∑ₖ₌₃∞ aₖ = ∑ₖ₌₃∞ [(1/3)aₖ₋₁ + (1/4)aₖ₋₂]. 

This sum can be split as follows:

  ∑ₖ₌₃∞ aₖ = (1/3) ∑ₖ₌₃∞ aₖ₋₁ + (1/4) ∑ₖ₌₃∞ aₖ₋₂.

Notice that by a change of index:

  ∑ₖ₌₃∞ aₖ₋₁ = ∑ⱼ₌₂∞ aⱼ = S – a₁ = S – 1,  
  ∑ₖ₌₃∞ aₖ₋₂ = ∑ⱼ₌₁∞ aⱼ = S.

Thus, we have:

  ∑ₖ₌₃∞ aₖ = (1/3)(S – 1) + (1/4)S.

Step 3. Substitute back into the sum S:

  S = 2 + (1/3)(S – 1) + (1/4)S.

To solve for S, combine like terms:

Multiply out the right-hand side:

  S = 2 + (1/3)S – 1/3 + (1/4)S  
  S = [2 – 1/3] + [(1/3)S + (1/4)S]  
  S = (6/3 – 1/3) + [(4/12 + 3/12)S]  
  S = (5/3) + (7/12)S.

Step 4. Isolate S by subtracting (7/12)S from both sides:

  S – (7/12)S = 5/3.

Express S on the left-hand side as a common factor:

  (12/12 – 7/12)S = 5/3,  
  (5/12)S = 5/3.

Now, solve for S:

  S = (5/3) ÷ (5/12)  
  S = (5/3) × (12/5)  
  S = 12/3  
  S = 4.

Thus, the sum of the infinite sequence is 4.
