Question: A sequence $a_1,$ $a_2,$ $a_3,$ $\dots,$ is defined recursively by $a_1 = 1,$ $a_2 = 1,$ and for $k \ge 3,$_x000D_
\[a_k = \frac{1}{3} a_{k - 1} + \frac{1}{4} a_{k - 2}.\]Evaluate $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dotsb.$
Teacher: Let's start by rephrasing the problem in our own words:

We have a sequence defined by:
  a₁ = 1, a₂ = 1, and for k ≥ 3, aₖ = (1/3)aₖ₋₁ + (1/4)aₖ₋₂.
We need to find the total sum S = a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + … .

A good strategy is to express S in a way that uses the recursive formula. Here are the steps we might consider:

1. Define S = a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + … .
2. Recognize that a₁ and a₂ are known, so write S as 1 + 1 plus the sum from k = 3 onward.
3. Substitute the recursive relation into the sum from k = 3 onward and change the indices so that portions of the sum can be written in terms of S.
4. Solve the resulting algebraic equation for S.

Now, let’s tackle the very first step.

Step 1: Express S by separating out the first two terms. Could you please write S in terms of a constant plus the sum starting from k = 3?
Student: Sure! Based on your guidance, I will express \( S \) by separating out the first two terms. 

We know that:

\[
S = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + \dotsb
\]

Given that \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = 1 \), we can write:

\[
S = 1 + 1 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + \dotsb
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
S = 2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + \dotsb
\]

Now, I will focus on expressing the sum from \( a_3 \) onward. Would you like me to continue with the next step?
Teacher: That's correct—you've neatly isolated the first two terms! Well done.

Now, let's move to the next step: we want to rewrite the sum from k = 3 to infinity using the recursion. Recall that for k ≥ 3, we have

  aₖ = (1/3)aₖ₋₁ + (1/4)aₖ₋₂.

So, write the sum from k = 3 onward as

  a₃ + a₄ + a₅ + … = Σₖ₌₃∞ aₖ  
             = Σₖ₌₃∞ [(1/3)aₖ₋₁ + (1/4)aₖ₋₂].

Your task for the next step is to re-index these sums so that they’re expressed in terms of S (or parts of S that we already know). Try to do that re-indexing for both pieces of the sum. What expression do you get?
Student: Sure! Let's rewrite the sum \( a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + \dotsb \) using the recursive formula. 

We start with:

\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k = \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{3} a_{k-1} + \frac{1}{4} a_{k-2} \right).
\]

Now, we can separate this into two sums:

\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-1} + \frac{1}{4} \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-2}.
\]

Next, we need to re-index these sums. For the first sum, we can set \( j = k - 1 \), which means when \( k = 3 \), \( j = 2 \). Therefore, we can rewrite the first sum as:

\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-1} = \sum_{j=2}^{\infty} a_j = S - a_1 = S - 1.
\]

For the second sum, we set \( m = k - 2 \), which means when \( k = 3 \), \( m = 1 \). Thus, we can rewrite the second sum as:

\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-2} = \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} a_m = S.
\]

Putting this all together, we have:

\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k = \frac{1}{3}(S - 1) + \frac{1}{4}S.
\]

Now, we can substitute this back into our expression for \( S \):

\[
S = 2 + \frac{1}{3}(S - 1) + \frac{1}{4}S.
\]

Would you like me to simplify this equation to solve for \( S \)?
Teacher: Great work on re-indexing the sums correctly! Now, for the next step, let’s simplify the equation you arrived at. You obtained:

  S = 2 + (1/3)(S – 1) + (1/4)S.

Please simplify this equation by expanding the terms and combining like terms, and then isolate S. What expression do you get after simplifying?
Student: Sure! Let's start by expanding and simplifying the equation:

\[
S = 2 + \frac{1}{3}(S - 1) + \frac{1}{4}S.
\]

First, we'll distribute \(\frac{1}{3}\) in the second term:

\[
S = 2 + \frac{1}{3}S - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}S.
\]

Now, let's combine the constant terms on the right side:

\[
S = 2 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3}S + \frac{1}{4}S.
\]

To combine \(2 - \frac{1}{3}\), we can convert \(2\) into a fraction with a denominator of \(3\):

\[
2 = \frac{6}{3},
\]

so,

\[
2 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{6}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{3}.
\]

Now our equation looks like this:

\[
S = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{1}{3}S + \frac{1}{4}S.
\]

Next, we need to combine the terms involving \(S\). To do that, we first need a common denominator for \(\frac{1}{3}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\). The least common multiple of \(3\) and \(4\) is \(12\). Thus, we can rewrite the coefficients of \(S\):

\[
\frac{1}{3}S = \frac{4}{12}S \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{4}S = \frac{3}{12}S.
\]

Now we can combine these:

\[
\frac{4}{12}S + \frac{3}{12}S = \frac{7}{12}S.
\]

Now substituting this back into the equation gives us:

\[
S = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{7}{12}S.
\]

Next, we want to isolate \(S\). We can subtract \(\frac{7}{12}S\) from both sides:

\[
S - \frac{7}{12}S = \frac{5}{3}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{5}{12}S = \frac{5}{3}.
\]

Now, to solve for \(S\), we multiply both sides by \(\frac{12}{5}\):

\[
S = \frac{5}{3} \cdot \frac{12}{5} = \frac{12}{3} = 4.
\]

Thus, the sum \(S = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dotsb\) evaluates to:

\[
\boxed{4}.
\]

Is there anything else you would like me to clarify or explore further?
Teacher: Your manipulations and algebraic simplifications are all correct! You've successfully isolated S, combined the terms, and solved for S to obtain S = 4. 

Well done! 

The final answer is: 4$
