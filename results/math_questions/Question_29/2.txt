Question: Simplify the following expression:   \[2x+3x^2+1-(6-2x-3x^2).\]
Teacher: Let's begin by restating the problem in our own words: We need to simplify the expression

  2x + 3x² + 1 – (6 – 2x – 3x²).

To simplify this, we can break the process into clear steps. The first step is to eliminate the parentheses by distributing the negative sign across the terms inside them. 

Can you show how you would distribute the negative sign over the expression (6 – 2x – 3x²)? What does the expression become after applying this distribution?
Student: Sure! To distribute the negative sign over the expression \( (6 - 2x - 3x^2) \), we need to change the signs of each term inside the parentheses. 

So, we take:

1. The \( 6 \) becomes \( -6 \).
2. The \( -2x \) becomes \( +2x \).
3. The \( -3x^2 \) becomes \( +3x^2 \).

Putting it all together, the expression \( 2x + 3x^2 + 1 - (6 - 2x - 3x^2) \) becomes:

\[ 2x + 3x^2 + 1 - 6 + 2x + 3x^2. \]

Now we can combine like terms. Would you like me to proceed with that?
Teacher: Great job distributing the negative sign over the parentheses! Now, let's move to the next step: combining like terms.

Take the expression you obtained:

 2x + 3x² + 1 - 6 + 2x + 3x²

Could you please combine the like terms (that is, the x² terms, the x terms, and the constant terms) and show me your work step-by-step?
Student: Student: Sure! Let's start by organizing the expression we have after distributing the negative sign:

\[ 2x + 3x^2 + 1 - 6 + 2x + 3x^2. \]

Now, we can combine the like terms step-by-step.

1. **Combine the \(x^2\) terms**:
   - We have \(3x^2 + 3x^2 = 6x^2\).

2. **Combine the \(x\) terms**:
   - We have \(2x + 2x = 4x\).

3. **Combine the constant terms**:
   - We have \(1 - 6 = -5\).

Putting it all together, the expression simplifies to:

\[ 6x^2 + 4x - 5. \]

Is this correct? Would you like me to summarize this in a final answer format?
Teacher: Great work combining like terms! You've correctly identified and combined the x² terms (3x² + 3x² to get 6x²), the x terms (2x + 2x to get 4x), and the constant terms (1 - 6 to get -5). 

So, the simplified expression is 6x² + 4x - 5.
