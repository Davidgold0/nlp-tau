Question: Simplify the following expression:   \[2x+3x^2+1-(6-2x-3x^2).\]
Teacher: Let's begin by understanding the problem: we need to simplify

  2x + 3x² + 1 – (6 – 2x – 3x²).

A good approach is to break it down into these steps:

1. Distribute the minus sign (−1) to the terms inside the parentheses.
2. Rewrite the expression without the parentheses.
3. Combine like terms (group together the x² terms, the x terms, and the constants).

Could you please start by handling Step 1? Specifically, show what the expression looks like once you distribute the minus sign across the parentheses.
Student: Sure! Let's start with Step 1 by distributing the minus sign across the terms inside the parentheses.

The expression we have is:

\[ 2x + 3x^2 + 1 - (6 - 2x - 3x^2) \]

When we distribute the minus sign, we change the signs of each term inside the parentheses:

- The \(6\) becomes \(-6\),
- The \(-2x\) becomes \(+2x\),
- The \(-3x^2\) becomes \(+3x^2\).

So, after distributing the minus sign, the expression becomes:

\[ 2x + 3x^2 + 1 - 6 + 2x + 3x^2 \]

Is this correct? Shall we move on to Step 2?
Teacher: Great job! Your distribution of the minus sign is correct. You wrote the expression as:

 2x + 3x² + 1 – 6 + 2x + 3x²

Now, please move on to the next step: combine like terms (i.e., group the x² terms, the x terms, and the constant terms). What do you get when you combine these like terms?
Student: Thank you! Now, let's combine the like terms in the expression:

\[ 2x + 3x^2 + 1 - 6 + 2x + 3x^2. \]

1. **Combine the \(x^2\) terms**:
   - We have \(3x^2 + 3x^2 = 6x^2\).

2. **Combine the \(x\) terms**:
   - We have \(2x + 2x = 4x\).

3. **Combine the constant terms**:
   - We have \(1 - 6 = -5\).

Putting it all together, the simplified expression becomes:

\[ 6x^2 + 4x - 5. \]

Is this correct? Would you like me to proceed with any further steps or clarifications?
Teacher: Excellent work! Your combination of like terms is spot on. You've correctly grouped the x² terms as 3x² + 3x² to get 6x², the x terms as 2x + 2x to get 4x, and the constants as 1 - 6 to yield -5. 

So the simplified expression is:

6x² + 4x - 5$

Great job!
Student: Thank you! I'm glad I was able to simplify the expression correctly to get \(6x^2 + 4x - 5\). If there's anything else you'd like to discuss or any further questions, I'm ready to continue!
Teacher: 6x² + 4x - 5$
