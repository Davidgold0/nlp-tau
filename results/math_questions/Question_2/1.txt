Question: Factor $t^2-121$.
Teacher: Let's begin by understanding the problem step by step. We need to factor the expression t² - 121. A good approach is to notice that both t² and 121 are perfect squares. 

Step 1: Identify the squares in the expression. 

• What is the square root of t²?
• What number squared gives 121?

Please answer this step, and then we'll move on together.
Student: Sure! 

The square root of \( t^2 \) is \( t \). 

For the number 121, the square root is 11, since \( 11^2 = 121 \). 

So, we have identified that \( t^2 \) is the square of \( t \) and \( 121 \) is the square of \( 11 \). 

What's the next step?
Teacher: Great job identifying the square roots! Now that we see t² is t² and 121 is 11², we recognize that the expression is a difference of two squares. The difference of squares formula is a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b).

Using this formula, what do you think the factored form becomes for t² - 121? Please provide your answer for this next step.
Student: The factored form of \( t^2 - 121 \) using the difference of squares formula \( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \) is:

\[
(t - 11)(t + 11)
\]

So, the expression \( t^2 - 121 \) factors to \( (t - 11)(t + 11) \). 

Is there anything else you would like to discuss regarding this problem?
Teacher: Great work! You've correctly identified the expression as a difference of squares and applied the formula a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b). You recognized that t² = t² and 121 = 11², and then wrote the factors (t - 11) and (t + 11).

To summarize our process:
1. We identified the square roots of t² and 121, which are t and 11 respectively.
2. We recognized the expression as a difference of squares.
3. We applied the formula a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b).
4. We factored the expression as (t - 11)(t + 11).

Your final answer is: (t - 11)(t + 11)$
