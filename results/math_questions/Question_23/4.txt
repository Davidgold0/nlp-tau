Question: Let $P$ be a plane passing through the origin.  When $\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}$ is projected onto plane $P,$ the result is $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$  When $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}$ is projected onto plane $P,$ what is the result?
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem into smaller steps. We have a plane P (through the origin) and we're given that when the vector v = (5, 3, 5) is projected onto P, the result is p = (3, 5, 1). This tells us something about the direction that is orthogonal to the plane.

Step 1: Notice that the difference between v and its projection p (that is, v – p) is perpendicular to P. Can you calculate that difference vector? Please work out this step and share your answer.
Student: Sure! Let's start by calculating the difference vector between the original vector \( v \) and its projection \( p \).

The original vector \( v \) is:
\[
v = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The projection \( p \) is:
\[
p = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, we can find the difference vector \( v - p \):
\[
v - p = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 - 3 \\ 3 - 5 \\ 5 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

So, the difference vector \( v - p \) is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

This vector is indeed perpendicular to the plane \( P \). Would you like me to proceed to the next step?
Teacher: Great work on finding the difference vector! 

Step 2: The difference vector you calculated, (2, –2, 4), is perpendicular to the plane P. This means it’s parallel to the normal vector of the plane. We can take n = (2, –2, 4) as a normal vector (or, any scalar multiple of it) for the plane.

Now, to find the projection of the vector w = (4, 0, 7) onto the plane P, we’ll need to remove from w the component that is in the direction of n. In other words, the projection of w onto the plane is given by:

  w_proj = w – ( (w ⋅ n) / (n ⋅ n) ) n

Let’s work on the next small step: Calculate the dot product w ⋅ n where w = (4, 0, 7) and n = (2, –2, 4). What do you get for w ⋅ n?
Student: Alright! Let's calculate the dot product \( w \cdot n \) where \( w = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( n = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \).

The dot product is calculated as follows:

\[
w \cdot n = 4 \cdot 2 + 0 \cdot (-2) + 7 \cdot 4
\]

Now, calculating each term:

1. \( 4 \cdot 2 = 8 \)
2. \( 0 \cdot (-2) = 0 \)
3. \( 7 \cdot 4 = 28 \)

Adding these together, we get:

\[
w \cdot n = 8 + 0 + 28 = 36
\]

So, the result of the dot product \( w \cdot n \) is \( 36 \). Would you like me to move on to the next step?
Teacher: Great job calculating w ⋅ n as 36!

Now, for the next step, we need to compute n ⋅ n, where n = (2, –2, 4). This dot product is found by summing the squares of each of the components of n.

Can you calculate n ⋅ n? Please show me your work for this step.
Student: Sure! Let's calculate the dot product \( n \cdot n \) where \( n = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \).

The dot product \( n \cdot n \) is calculated as follows:

\[
n \cdot n = 2^2 + (-2)^2 + 4^2
\]

Now, calculating each term:

1. \( 2^2 = 4 \)
2. \( (-2)^2 = 4 \)
3. \( 4^2 = 16 \)

Adding these together, we get:

\[
n \cdot n = 4 + 4 + 16 = 24
\]

So, the result of the dot product \( n \cdot n \) is \( 24 \). Would you like me to proceed to the next step?
Teacher: Excellent work! Your calculation of n ⋅ n as 24 is correct.

Now let's move on to the next step. We want to remove from w the component in the direction of n. To do that, we need to calculate the vector

  ( (w ⋅ n) / (n ⋅ n) ) · n

We've already found:
  w ⋅ n = 36
  n ⋅ n = 24

So first, compute the scalar factor (w ⋅ n)/(n ⋅ n). What do you get for that scalar? Once you have that, multiply it by n = (2, –2, 4). Please solve this step and share your answer.
Student: Alright! Let's calculate the scalar factor \((w \cdot n) / (n \cdot n)\) using the values we have:

\[
w \cdot n = 36
\]
\[
n \cdot n = 24
\]

Now, we can compute the scalar:

\[
\frac{w \cdot n}{n \cdot n} = \frac{36}{24} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

Now that we have the scalar \(\frac{3}{2}\), we need to multiply it by the normal vector \(n = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\):

\[
\frac{3}{2} \cdot n = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3}{2} \cdot 2 \\ \frac{3}{2} \cdot (-2) \\ \frac{3}{2} \cdot 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}
\]

So, the result of \(\frac{(w \cdot n)}{(n \cdot n)} \cdot n\) is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Would you like me to move on to the next step?
Teacher: Excellent work so far! You've successfully computed the scalar factor and the resulting vector (3, –3, 6). 

Now, for the next step: recall that the projection of w onto the plane P is given by

  w_proj = w – [ (w ⋅ n)/(n ⋅ n) ] · n.

You've already calculated (w ⋅ n)/(n ⋅ n) · n = (3, –3, 6), and we know w = (4, 0, 7). 

Please compute w_proj by subtracting (3, –3, 6) from w, that is, calculate

  w_proj = (4, 0, 7) – (3, –3, 6).

Show your steps and share your answer.
Student: Sure! Let's calculate the projection of \( w \) onto the plane \( P \) by subtracting the vector \( (3, -3, 6) \) from \( w = (4, 0, 7) \).

The calculation is as follows:

\[
w_{\text{proj}} = w - \left( \frac{(w \cdot n)}{(n \cdot n)} \cdot n \right) = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, we perform the subtraction component-wise:

1. For the first component: \( 4 - 3 = 1 \)
2. For the second component: \( 0 - (-3) = 0 + 3 = 3 \)
3. For the third component: \( 7 - 6 = 1 \)

Putting it all together, we get:

\[
w_{\text{proj}} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Thus, the projection of \( \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} \) onto the plane \( P \) is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Would you like to discuss anything further about this problem?
Teacher: Great job working through all the steps! You've determined that the projection of w = (4, 0, 7) onto the plane is given by

  w_proj = (4, 0, 7) – (3, –3, 6) = (1, 3, 1).

To summarize our process:
1. We computed the difference vector v – p = (2, –2, 4), which is perpendicular to the plane.
2. We used this as our normal vector n.
3. We then calculated w ⋅ n = 36 and n ⋅ n = 24.
4. Forming the scalar (w ⋅ n)/(n ⋅ n) = 3/2, we multiplied it by n to get (3, –3, 6).
5. Finally, subtracting this from w gave us the projection onto the plane: (1, 3, 1).

Your final answer is 
(1, 3, 1)$
