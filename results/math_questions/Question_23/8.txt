Question: Let $P$ be a plane passing through the origin.  When $\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}$ is projected onto plane $P,$ the result is $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$  When $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}$ is projected onto plane $P,$ what is the result?
3o-mini: We are told that when the vector v = (5, 3, 5) is projected onto a plane P (which passes through the origin), the result is p = (3, 5, 1). The projection of a vector onto a plane is the original vector minus its component in the direction of the plane's normal vector. Thus, we have:

  v - p = (5 - 3, 3 - 5, 5 - 1) = (2, -2, 4)

This vector (2, -2, 4) is perpendicular to the plane P, so it must be parallel to a normal vector n to the plane. We can take:

  n = (1, -1, 2)                       [since (2, -2, 4) = 2·(1, -1, 2)]

Now, we wish to project another vector, u = (4, 0, 7), onto the plane P. The projection of u onto the plane is given by:

  proj_P(u) = u − proj_n(u)

The projection of u onto n is given by the formula:

  proj_n(u) = [(u · n) / (n · n)] n

First, compute the dot products:

  u · n = 4·1 + 0·(−1) + 7·2 = 4 + 0 + 14 = 18

  n · n = 1^2 + (−1)^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

So, we have:

  proj_n(u) = (18/6) n = 3 · (1, −1, 2) = (3, −3, 6)

Finally, subtract this from u to obtain the projection onto the plane:

  proj_P(u) = u − proj_n(u) = (4, 0, 7) − (3, −3, 6) = (4 − 3, 0 − (−3), 7 − 6)
       = (1, 3, 1)

Thus, the projection of (4, 0, 7) onto plane P is (1, 3, 1).
