Question: Let $P$ be a plane passing through the origin.  When $\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}$ is projected onto plane $P,$ the result is $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$  When $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}$ is projected onto plane $P,$ what is the result?
3o-mini: We are given that the projection of the vector v = (5, 3, 5) onto the plane P results in w = (3, 5, 1). Since P passes through the origin, the difference v - w is perpendicular to P, meaning it is parallel to a normal vector n of the plane.

Step 1. Find a normal vector.
  n = v - w = (5 - 3, 3 - 5, 5 - 1) = (2, -2, 4).

Step 2. Use the projection formula for a vector u = (4, 0, 7) onto plane P.
  The projection of u onto P is given by:
    proj_P(u) = u - proj_n(u)
  where proj_n(u) is the projection of u onto the normal vector n.

Step 3. Compute proj_n(u).
  proj_n(u) = [(u ⋅ n) / (n ⋅ n)] * n.
  Calculate u ⋅ n:
    (4)(2) + (0)(-2) + (7)(4) = 8 + 0 + 28 = 36.
  Calculate n ⋅ n:
    (2)^2 + (-2)^2 + (4)^2 = 4 + 4 + 16 = 24.
  So, proj_n(u) = (36/24) n = (3/2) * (2, -2, 4).

Step 4. Multiply out and subtract:
  (3/2) * (2, -2, 4) = (3, -3, 6).
  Thus, proj_P(u) = (4, 0, 7) - (3, -3, 6) = (4 - 3, 0 - (-3), 7 - 6) = (1, 3, 1).

The projection of the vector (4, 0, 7) onto the plane P is (1, 3, 1).
