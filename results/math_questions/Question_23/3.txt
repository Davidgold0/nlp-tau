Question: Let $P$ be a plane passing through the origin.  When $\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}$ is projected onto plane $P,$ the result is $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$  When $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}$ is projected onto plane $P,$ what is the result?
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem into clear steps. We know that when a vector is projected onto a plane, the difference between the original vector and its projection is parallel to the plane’s normal vector.

Step 1: Find the vector that represents the difference between the given vector and its projection.

The given vector is [5, 3, 5] and its projection is [3, 5, 1]. Can you calculate the difference (i.e. the original vector minus its projection)? Please show your work for this step.
Student: Sure! To find the difference between the original vector and its projection, we subtract the projection vector from the original vector.

The original vector is \(\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\) and the projection is \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\).

Now, let's perform the subtraction:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 - 3 \\ 3 - 5 \\ 5 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

So, the difference vector is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\). 

This vector represents the component of \(\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\) that is perpendicular to the plane \(P\). 

What should we do next?
Teacher: Great job! Your calculation of the difference vector is correct. This vector, (2, -2, 4), is parallel to the plane’s normal vector.

Now for Step 2: We need to use this normal direction to project the second vector onto the plane. Remember that the projection of a vector v onto the plane is found by subtracting from v its projection onto the plane's normal.

That is, if n is a normal vector to the plane, then for any vector v, the projection onto n is 
  projₙ(v) = (v · n)/(n · n) ⋅ n,
and the projection of v onto the plane is 
  v - projₙ(v).

For our problem, take v = (4, 0, 7) and n = (2, -2, 4).

Can you show your work computing the dot products and figuring out the projection of (4, 0, 7) onto n? Please work through just that step.
Student: Sure! Let's start by calculating the dot products needed to find the projection of the vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}\) onto the normal vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we need to compute the dot product \(v \cdot n\):

\[
v \cdot n = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = (4 \cdot 2) + (0 \cdot -2) + (7 \cdot 4) = 8 + 0 + 28 = 36.
\]

Next, we calculate the dot product \(n \cdot n\):

\[
n \cdot n = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = (2 \cdot 2) + (-2 \cdot -2) + (4 \cdot 4) = 4 + 4 + 16 = 24.
\]

Now we can find the projection of \(v\) onto \(n\) using the formula:

\[
\text{proj}_n(v) = \frac{v \cdot n}{n \cdot n} \cdot n = \frac{36}{24} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

So, the projection of \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}\) onto the normal vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\).

What do we do next?
Teacher: Excellent work so far! You’ve correctly calculated the dot products and obtained the projection of (4, 0, 7) onto the normal vector n = (2, -2, 4) as (3, -3, 6).

Now, for the next step, recall that to find the projection of (4, 0, 7) onto the plane, we subtract its projection onto the normal from the original vector. In other words:

  Projection on P = (4, 0, 7) – (projection onto n).

Can you compute this subtraction? Please show your work for just this step.
Student: Sure! To find the projection of the vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}\) onto the plane \(P\), we need to subtract the projection onto the normal vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\) from the original vector.

Let's perform the subtraction:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 3 \\ 0 - (-3) \\ 7 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

So, the projection of \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}\) onto the plane \(P\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\).

Is there anything else you would like me to do?
Teacher: Great job! You've correctly found that the projection of (4, 0, 7) onto the plane P is given by subtracting the projection onto the normal vector from the original vector:

  (4, 0, 7) – (3, -3, 6) = (1, 3, 1).

Your final answer is: 
(1, 3, 1)$
