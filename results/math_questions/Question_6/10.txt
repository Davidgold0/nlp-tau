Question: Sam decides to start a rumor. Sam tells the rumor to her three friends. Each of Sam's three friends then tells the rumor to three friends who have not heard the rumor. This continues for five total cycles. Sam telling her three friends was the first cycle. How many people, not including Sam, will have heard the rumor when the fifth cycle is complete?
3o-mini: In the first cycle, Sam tells 3 friends, so 3 people hear the rumor. In each subsequent cycle, every person who just heard the rumor tells 3 friends who haven't heard it yet. This creates a geometric sequence:

  Cycle 1: 3 people  
  Cycle 2: 3² = 9 people  
  Cycle 3: 3³ = 27 people  
  Cycle 4: 3⁴ = 81 people  
  Cycle 5: 3⁵ = 243 people  

To find the total number of people who have heard the rumor (not including Sam), add these amounts:

  Total = 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243  
  Total = 363

Thus, when the fifth cycle is complete, 363 people (not including Sam) will have heard the rumor.
