Question: Sam decides to start a rumor. Sam tells the rumor to her three friends. Each of Sam's three friends then tells the rumor to three friends who have not heard the rumor. This continues for five total cycles. Sam telling her three friends was the first cycle. How many people, not including Sam, will have heard the rumor when the fifth cycle is complete?
3o-mini: We notice that in each cycle, each person tells the rumor to three new people. The first cycle consists of Sam telling her three friends.

Here is how many people hear the rumor in each cycle:
• Cycle 1: 3 people
• Cycle 2: 3² = 9 people
• Cycle 3: 3³ = 27 people
• Cycle 4: 3⁴ = 81 people
• Cycle 5: 3⁵ = 243 people

To find the total number of people (not including Sam) who have heard the rumor, we add these numbers:
3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 = 363

Thus, 363 people will have heard the rumor by the end of the fifth cycle.
