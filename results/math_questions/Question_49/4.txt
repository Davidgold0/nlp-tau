Question: What is the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $8x^2 - 38x + 35 = 0$? Express your answer as a decimal.
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem. We need to find the smallest value of x that satisfies the quadratic equation: 8x² - 38x + 35 = 0. A good approach here is to use the quadratic formula:

  x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)

Before applying the formula, we need to identify the coefficients a, b, and c from the equation.

What are the values of a, b, and c in this equation? Please solve this first step.
Student: Sure! In the equation \(8x^2 - 38x + 35 = 0\), we can identify the coefficients as follows:

- \(a = 8\) (the coefficient of \(x^2\))
- \(b = -38\) (the coefficient of \(x\))
- \(c = 35\) (the constant term)

So, \(a = 8\), \(b = -38\), and \(c = 35\). What's the next step?
Teacher: Great job in identifying a = 8, b = -38, and c = 35! The next step is to calculate the discriminant, which is given by the formula:

  Discriminant = b² - 4ac

Could you please compute the discriminant for this quadratic equation using your values of a, b, and c? Let me know your result for this step.
Student: Student: Sure! To calculate the discriminant using the formula \(b² - 4ac\), I'll substitute in the values we identified:

- \(b = -38\)
- \(a = 8\)
- \(c = 35\)

Now, let's compute it step by step:

1. Calculate \(b²\):
   \[
   (-38)² = 1444
   \]

2. Calculate \(4ac\):
   \[
   4 \times 8 \times 35 = 1120
   \]

3. Now, subtract \(4ac\) from \(b²\):
   \[
   1444 - 1120 = 324
   \]

So, the discriminant is \(324\). What should I do next?
Teacher: Excellent work calculating the discriminant as 324! Now, the next step is to compute the square root of the discriminant. Could you please determine what √324 is? Take your time and share your result for this step.
Student: Sure! To compute the square root of the discriminant, which is 324, we find:

\[
\sqrt{324} = 18
\]

So, the square root of 324 is 18. What should I do next?
Teacher: Great job finding that √324 = 18! Now that we have this, it's time to plug everything into the quadratic formula. Remember that the quadratic formula is:

  x = (–b ± √(b² – 4ac)) / (2a)

Using the values we have:
  a = 8, b = –38, and √(b² – 4ac) = 18,

this becomes:
  x = (–(–38) ± 18) / (2 × 8)
    = (38 ± 18) / 16

Could you now compute the two possible solutions by calculating (38 + 18) / 16 and (38 – 18) / 16? Once you have both values, please identify which one is the smallest value.
Student: Sure! Let's compute the two possible solutions using the expression we derived:

1. For the first solution, we calculate:
   \[
   x_1 = \frac{38 + 18}{16} = \frac{56}{16} = 3.5
   \]

2. For the second solution, we calculate:
   \[
   x_2 = \frac{38 - 18}{16} = \frac{20}{16} = 1.25
   \]

Now, we have the two solutions: \(x_1 = 3.5\) and \(x_2 = 1.25\). 

The smallest value of \(x\) that satisfies the equation is \(1.25\). 

Is there anything else you would like me to do?
Teacher: Great work! Let's summarize the process:

1. We identified the coefficients: a = 8, b = –38, and c = 35.
2. We computed the discriminant: (–38)² – 4·8·35 = 1444 – 1120 = 324.
3. We found the square root of the discriminant: √324 = 18.
4. We plugged these into the quadratic formula, giving us two solutions: 
  x = (38 + 18) / 16 = 56 / 16 = 3.5 and x = (38 – 18) / 16 = 20 / 16 = 1.25.
5. Since we need the smallest value, we conclude that x = 1.25.

Your final answer is: 1.25$
