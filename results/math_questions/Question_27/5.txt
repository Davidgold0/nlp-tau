Question: A class of 25 students includes the Smith quadruplets.  The teacher must select two students from the class to represent the class in the school's student government.  Instead of holding an election, the teacher decides to choose the two representatives at random.  What is the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets?
Teacher: Let's start by understanding what the problem is asking. We need to find the probability that if the teacher randomly picks 2 students from 25, both will be among the 4 Smith quadruplets. To do this, we can break the problem down into these steps:

1. Find the total number of ways to choose 2 students out of 25.
2. Find the number of ways to choose 2 students from the 4 Smith quadruplets.
3. Divide the number from step 2 by the number from step 1 to get the probability.

For our first step, can you explain how to calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 students from 25 (using combinations)? What expression or formula would you use, and what does it evaluate to?
Student: To calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 students from 25, we can use the combinations formula, which is given by:

\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
\]

In this case, \( n = 25 \) (the total number of students) and \( r = 2 \) (the number of students we want to choose). So, we can set it up as follows:

\[
\binom{25}{2} = \frac{25!}{2!(25 - 2)!} = \frac{25!}{2! \cdot 23!}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\binom{25}{2} = \frac{25 \times 24}{2 \times 1} = \frac{600}{2} = 300
\]

So, there are 300 different ways to choose 2 students from a class of 25. 

Would you like me to proceed to the next step and find the number of ways to choose 2 students from the 4 Smith quadruplets?
Teacher: Great job on explaining the calculation for the total number of ways to choose 2 students from 25 and arriving correctly at 300. 

Now, let's move on to the next step: finding the number of ways to choose 2 students from the 4 Smith quadruplets. Can you set up this calculation using the combination formula, and then tell me what expression you'd use and what it evaluates to?
Student: Student: To find the number of ways to choose 2 students from the 4 Smith quadruplets, we can again use the combinations formula:

\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
\]

In this case, \( n = 4 \) (the number of Smith quadruplets) and \( r = 2 \) (the number of students we want to choose). So we can set it up as follows:

\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = \frac{4!}{2! \cdot 2!}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
\]

So, there are 6 different ways to choose 2 students from the 4 Smith quadruplets. 

Would you like me to proceed to the final step and calculate the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets?
Teacher: Great work! You've correctly set up the combinations for both the total number of ways to choose 2 students and the ways to choose 2 Smith quadruplets. Now for the final step, we need to determine the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes. 

What do you get when you divide 6 (the number of ways to choose 2 from the quadruplets) by 300 (the total number of ways to choose 2 from 25)? Please simplify the fraction in your answer.
Student: Student: To find the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets, we divide the number of ways to choose 2 students from the quadruplets (which is 6) by the total number of ways to choose 2 students from the class of 25 (which is 300). 

So, the probability \( P \) can be calculated as follows:

\[
P = \frac{\text{Number of ways to choose 2 from quadruplets}}{\text{Total ways to choose 2 from 25}} = \frac{6}{300}
\]

Now, we can simplify this fraction:

\[
P = \frac{6 \div 6}{300 \div 6} = \frac{1}{50}
\]

Thus, the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets is \( \frac{1}{50} \).
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly calculated the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets as 1/50.

Your steps were:
1. Found the total number of ways to choose 2 students from 25 using the combination formula, arriving at 300.
2. Calculated the number of ways to choose 2 students from the 4 quadruplets, arriving at 6.
3. Divided 6 by 300 to simplify the probability to 1/50.

The final answer is 1/50$
