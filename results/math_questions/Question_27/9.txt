Question: A class of 25 students includes the Smith quadruplets.  The teacher must select two students from the class to represent the class in the school's student government.  Instead of holding an election, the teacher decides to choose the two representatives at random.  What is the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets?
3o-mini: The total number of ways to select 2 students from 25 is given by the combination C(25, 2).  

C(25, 2) = 25 × 24 / 2 = 300.

The number of ways to choose 2 Smith quadruplets from the 4 available is given by C(4, 2).

C(4, 2) = 4 × 3 / 2 = 6.

Thus, the probability that both selected students are Smith quadruplets is 6/300, which simplifies to 1/50.

The answer is 1/50.
