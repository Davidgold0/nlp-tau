Question: A class of 25 students includes the Smith quadruplets.  The teacher must select two students from the class to represent the class in the school's student government.  Instead of holding an election, the teacher decides to choose the two representatives at random.  What is the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets?
Teacher: Let's first break down the problem:

We need to calculate the probability that both representatives chosen at random are among the Smith quadruplets. To do this, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of ways to choose 2 students from the 25 in the class.
2. Determine the number of ways to choose 2 students from the 4 Smith quadruplets.
3. Compute the probability by dividing the number from step 2 by the number from step 1.

Let's start with the first step. Please calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 students out of 25. (Hint: Use the combination formula nCr = n! / [r!(n â€“ r)!].) What is your result for 25 choose 2?
Student: To calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 students from 25, I will use the combination formula \( nCr = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!} \).

Here, \( n = 25 \) and \( r = 2 \).

So, the calculation is:

\[
25C2 = \frac{25!}{2!(25 - 2)!} = \frac{25!}{2! \times 23!}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
25C2 = \frac{25 \times 24}{2 \times 1} = \frac{600}{2} = 300
\]

Therefore, the total number of ways to choose 2 students from the class of 25 is 300. 

Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Great job on the first step! You've correctly computed that there are 300 ways to choose 2 students from 25.

Now, let's move on to the next step: we need to determine the number of ways to choose 2 students from the 4 Smith quadruplets. Using the combination formula, please calculate 4 choose 2. What is your result for this step?
Student: To calculate the number of ways to choose 2 students from the 4 Smith quadruplets, I will again use the combination formula \( nCr = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!} \).

Here, \( n = 4 \) and \( r = 2 \).

So, the calculation is:

\[
4C2 = \frac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = \frac{4!}{2! \times 2!}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
4C2 = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
\]

Therefore, the number of ways to choose 2 students from the 4 Smith quadruplets is 6.

Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Great work on calculating that there are 6 ways to choose 2 students from the 4 quadruplets!

Now for the last step: we need to determine the probability that both representatives selected will be among the Smith quadruplets. To do this, you should divide the number of ways to select 2 quadruplets (which is 6) by the total number of ways to choose any 2 students from the 25 (which is 300). Could you please perform this division and simplify your answer? Tell me what you get for 6 divided by 300, simplified as much as possible.
Student: To find the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets, I will divide the number of ways to choose 2 quadruplets (which is 6) by the total number of ways to choose 2 students from the class (which is 300):

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{6}{300}
\]

Now, I can simplify this fraction. Both 6 and 300 can be divided by 6:

\[
\frac{6 \div 6}{300 \div 6} = \frac{1}{50}
\]

Therefore, the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets is \( \frac{1}{50} \).

Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly simplified 6/300 to 1/50. As a quick recap, you:

1. Calculated the total number of ways to choose 2 out of 25 students (300).
2. Calculated the number of ways to choose 2 out of the 4 Smith quadruplets (6).
3. Found the probability by dividing the two (6/300), which simplified to 1/50.

The final answer is 1/50$
