Question: What is the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6?
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem in our own words: We are asked to find the sum of the reciprocals of all the natural-number factors of 6.

The steps we can follow are:

1. Identify all the natural-number factors of 6.
2. Write the reciprocal for each factor.
3. Sum these reciprocals.

Let's begin with the first step. Can you list all the natural-number factors of 6?
Student: Sure! The natural-number factors of 6 are the numbers that divide 6 without leaving a remainder. The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. 

So, the natural-number factors of 6 are: 1, 2, 3, and 6. 

What should I do next?
Teacher: Great job! You've correctly identified the factors of 6 as 1, 2, 3, and 6.

Now, the next step is to write the reciprocal of each factor. Remember, the reciprocal of a number is 1 divided by that number.

Can you write down the reciprocals for each of the factors (1, 2, 3, and 6)?
Student: Student: Sure! Here are the reciprocals for each of the factors:

- The reciprocal of 1 is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \).
- The reciprocal of 2 is \( \frac{1}{2} \).
- The reciprocal of 3 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- The reciprocal of 6 is \( \frac{1}{6} \).

So, the reciprocals of the factors 1, 2, 3, and 6 are: 1, \( \frac{1}{2} \), \( \frac{1}{3} \), and \( \frac{1}{6} \).

What should I do next?
Teacher: Excellent work listing all the reciprocals correctly! The next step is to sum these reciprocals. Remember, you need to add 1, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6 together.

How would you approach adding these fractions? You might consider finding a common denominator or adding them step by step. Please show your work for this next step.
Student: Student: Thank you! To sum the fractions \(1\), \( \frac{1}{2} \), \( \frac{1}{3} \), and \( \frac{1}{6} \), I will first find a common denominator. 

The denominators are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is 6. 

Now, I will convert each fraction to have a denominator of 6:

- For \(1\), I can write it as \( \frac{6}{6} \).
- For \( \frac{1}{2} \), I can convert it to \( \frac{3}{6} \) (since \(1 \div 2 = 0.5\) and \(6 \div 2 = 3\)).
- For \( \frac{1}{3} \), I can convert it to \( \frac{2}{6} \) (since \(1 \div 3 \approx 0.33\) and \(6 \div 3 = 2\)).
- For \( \frac{1}{6} \), it stays as \( \frac{1}{6} \).

Now I can add them together:

\[
\frac{6}{6} + \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{6 + 3 + 2 + 1}{6} = \frac{12}{6}
\]

Finally, simplifying \( \frac{12}{6} \) gives me \( 2 \).

So, the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6 is \( 2 \). 

Is that correct?
Teacher: Great job working through the addition of the reciprocals! Let's review your steps briefly:

1. You correctly identified the natural-number factors of 6 as 1, 2, 3, and 6.
2. You correctly wrote their reciprocals: 1, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6.
3. You then found a common denominator (6) and converted each fraction:
  1 = 6/6,
  1/2 = 3/6,
  1/3 = 2/6,
  and 1/6 remains 1/6.
4. Adding these gave: (6 + 3 + 2 + 1) / 6 = 12/6 = 2.

Everything looks perfect. Your reasoning is spot on. 

Your final answer is 2$
