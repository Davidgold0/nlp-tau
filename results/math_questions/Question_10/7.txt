Question: What is the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6?
3o-mini: The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Their reciprocals are 1, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6. Adding these together:

1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6

To add these fractions, convert each to have a common denominator (6):

= 6/6 + 3/6 + 2/6 + 1/6

= (6 + 3 + 2 + 1) / 6

= 12/6

= 2

So, the sum is 2.
