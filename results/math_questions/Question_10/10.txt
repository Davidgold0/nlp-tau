Question: What is the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6?
3o-mini: The natural-number factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Their reciprocals are 1, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6. 

Adding these together:

1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 

To add the fractions, find a common denominator, which is 6:

= 6/6 + 3/6 + 2/6 + 1/6  
= (6 + 3 + 2 + 1) / 6  
= 12/6  
= 2

Thus, the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6 is 2.
