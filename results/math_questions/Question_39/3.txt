Question: Let $S$ be the increasing sequence of positive integers whose binary representation has exactly $8$ ones. Let $N$ be the 1000th number in $S$. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.
Teacher: Let's start by rephrasing the problem in our own words to ensure we fully understand it:

We are considering the increasing sequence S of all positive integers whose binary representation has exactly 8 ones. For any positive integer with n binary digits (n ≥ 8), if the number has exactly 8 ones, then because the most significant digit is always one, the remaining n – 1 digits must have 7 ones. This means there are C(n – 1, 7) numbers with exactly n binary digits in S.

Our first goal is to determine how many numbers in S have a given number of digits. Then, by summing these counts for n = 8, 9, 10, …, we will find the smallest n for which the cumulative sum is at least 1000. This n will be the number of digits in the 1000th number in the sequence.

Step 1: Calculate the counts for n = 8, n = 9, n = 10, etc., using C(n – 1, 7), and keep a running total until you reach or exceed 1000.

Could you start by calculating these counts step by step? For example, start with n = 8 and then move on. What is C(7, 7), and how many numbers do you have so far?
Student: Sure! Let's start with the first step as you suggested.

For \( n = 8 \):
We need to calculate \( C(7, 7) \), which represents the number of ways to choose 7 ones from 7 positions (since there are 8 digits in total, and one of them is fixed as 1). 

Using the binomial coefficient formula:
\[
C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]
we have:
\[
C(7, 7) = \frac{7!}{7! \cdot 0!} = 1
\]

So, there is 1 number in \( S \) that has exactly 8 digits and 8 ones. This number is \( 255 \) in decimal (which is \( 11111111 \) in binary).

Now, let's keep a running total. So far, we have:
- Total count for \( n = 8 \): 1
- Cumulative total: 1

Next, let's calculate for \( n = 9 \):
\[
C(8, 7) = \frac{8!}{7! \cdot 1!} = 8
\]

Now we update our cumulative total:
- Total count for \( n = 9 \): 8
- Cumulative total: \( 1 + 8 = 9 \)

Now, for \( n = 10 \):
\[
C(9, 7) = \frac{9!}{7! \cdot 2!} = \frac{9 \times 8}{2} = 36
\]

Updating our cumulative total:
- Total count for \( n = 10 \): 36
- Cumulative total: \( 9 + 36 = 45 \)

Next, for \( n = 11 \):
\[
C(10, 7) = \frac{10!}{7! \cdot 3!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 120
\]

Updating our cumulative total:
- Total count for \( n = 11 \): 120
- Cumulative total: \( 45 + 120 = 165 \)

Now, for \( n = 12 \):
\[
C(11, 7) = \frac{11!}{7! \cdot 4!} = \frac{11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 330
\]

Updating our cumulative total:
- Total count for \( n = 12 \): 330
- Cumulative total: \( 165 + 330 = 495 \)

Next, for \( n = 13 \):
\[
C(12, 7) = \frac{12!}{7! \cdot 5!} = \frac{12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 792
\]

Updating our cumulative total:
- Total count for \( n = 13 \): 792
- Cumulative total: \( 495 + 792 = 1287 \)

At this point, we have exceeded 1000. The cumulative total reaches 1287 when \( n = 13 \).

Now, we know that the 1000th number in the sequence \( S \) has 13 binary digits. The next step would be to find the specific position of the 1000th number in the sequence of numbers with 13 digits.

The count of numbers with fewer than 13 digits is 1287 - 792 = 205. Since the 1000th number is the 205th number with 13 digits, we need to find the 205th configuration of 8 ones and 5 zeros in a 13-digit binary number.

Would you like me to proceed with finding the 205th number with 8 ones and 5 zeros in the binary representation?
Teacher: Great work on computing the counts for n = 8 through n = 13. I noticed you mentioned that the cumulative total reached 495 for numbers with fewer than 13 digits, and then you stated that the 1000th number is the 205th number among the 13-digit numbers. Let's double-check that arithmetic.

The counts we calculated are:
 n = 8: 1  
 n = 9: 8  
 n = 10: 36  
 n = 11: 120  
 n = 12: 330  
which sum to 1 + 8 + 36 + 120 + 330 = 495.  

Since the total count for n = 13 is 792, the cumulative total up to n = 13 is 495 + 792 = 1287. This means the numbers with 13 digits start at the 496th overall number. 

So, to find the ordinal position of the 1000th number among the 13-digit numbers, what should you compute? Please solve for that next step.
Student: Thank you for pointing that out! Since the cumulative total for numbers with fewer than 13 digits is 495, the 1000th number in the sequence \( S \) is actually the \( 1000 - 495 = 505 \)th number among the 13-digit numbers.

Now, we need to find the 505th configuration of 8 ones and 5 zeros in a 13-digit binary number. 

To determine the 505th number, we can use the binomial coefficients to find how many configurations start with a certain number of leading ones. We will proceed by considering how many numbers can be formed by fixing the first few digits as ones and then calculating how many valid configurations remain.

1. **Fix the first digit as 1:** This leaves us with 12 digits, needing to place 7 ones and 5 zeros.
   \[
   \text{Count} = C(11, 7) = 330
   \]
   (This means there are 330 valid configurations starting with 1.)

2. **Fix the first two digits as 1s:** This leaves us with 11 digits, needing to place 6 ones and 5 zeros.
   \[
   \text{Count} = C(10, 6) = 210
   \]
   (This means there are 210 valid configurations starting with 11.)

3. **Fix the first three digits as 1s:** This leaves us with 10 digits, needing to place 5 ones and 5 zeros.
   \[
   \text{Count} = C(9, 5) = 126
   \]
   (This means there are 126 valid configurations starting with 111.)

Now let's summarize the counts:
- Starting with 1: 330 (total so far = 330)
- Starting with 11: 210 (total so far = 540)
- Starting with 111: 126 (total so far = 666)

Since 505 is between 330 and 540, we know that the 505th number starts with "11". 

Next, we need to find the position of the 505th number among those starting with "11". Since the first two digits are fixed as "11", we need to find the \( 505 - 330 = 175 \)th configuration of 6 ones and 5 zeros in the remaining 11 digits.

1. **Fix the first digit (after "11") as 1:** This leaves us with 10 digits, needing to place 5 ones and 5 zeros.
   \[
   \text{Count} = C(9, 5) = 126
   \]

2. **Fix the first two digits (after "11") as 11:** This leaves us with 9 digits, needing to place 4 ones and 5 zeros.
   \[
   \text{Count} = C(8, 4) = 70
   \]

3. **Fix the first three digits (after "11") as 111:** This leaves us with 8 digits, needing to place 3 ones and 5 zeros.
   \[
   \text{Count} = C(7, 3) = 35
   \]

4. **Fix the first four digits (after "11") as 1111:** This leaves us with 7 digits, needing to place 2 ones and 5 zeros.
   \[
   \text{Count} = C(6, 2) = 15
   \]

5. **Fix the first five digits (after "11") as 11111:** This leaves us with 6 digits, needing to place 1 one and 5 zeros.
   \[
   \text{Count} = C(5, 1) = 5
   \]

6. **Fix the first six digits (after "11") as 111111:** This leaves us with 5 digits, needing to place 0 ones and 5 zeros.
   \[
   \text{Count} = C(4, 0) = 1
   \]

Now let's summarize these counts:
- Starting with "111": 126 (total = 126)
- Starting with "1111": 70 (total = 196)
- Starting with "11111": 35 (total = 231)
- Starting with "111111": 15 (total = 246)
- Starting with "1111111": 5 (total = 251)
- Starting with "11111111": 1 (total = 252)

Since 175 is between 126 and 196, the 175th configuration starts with "1111". 

Now we need to find the \( 175 - 126 = 49 \)th configuration of 5 ones and 5 zeros in the remaining 9 digits.

Following the same process:
1. **Fix the first digit (after "1111") as 1:** This leaves us with 8 digits, needing to place 4 ones and 5 zeros.
   \[
   \text{Count} = C(7, 4) = 35
   \]

2. **Fix the first two digits (after "1111") as 11:** This leaves us with 7 digits, needing to place 3 ones and 5 zeros.
   \[
   \text{Count} = C(6, 3) = 20
   \]

3. **Fix the first three digits (after "1111") as 111:** This leaves us with 6 digits, needing to place 2 ones and 5 zeros.
   \[
   \text{Count} = C(5, 2) = 10
   \]

4. **Fix the first four digits (after "1111") as 1111:** This leaves us with 5 digits, needing to place 1 one and 5 zeros.
   \[
   \text{Count} = C(4, 1) = 4
   \]

5. **Fix the first five digits (after "1111") as 11111:** This leaves us with 4 digits, needing to place 0 ones and 5 zeros.
   \[
   \text{Count} = C(3, 0) = 1
   \]

Summarizing:
- Starting with "11111": 35 (total = 35)
- Starting with "111111": 20 (total = 55)
- Starting with "1111111": 10 (total = 65)
- Starting with "11111111": 4 (total = 69)
- Starting with "111111111": 1 (total = 70)

Since 49 is between 35 and 55, the 49th configuration starts with "111111". 

Now we need to find the \( 49 - 35 = 14 \)th configuration of 2 ones and 5 zeros in the remaining 7 digits.

Following the same process:
1. **Fix the first digit (after "111111") as 1:** This leaves us with 6 digits, needing to place 1 one and 5 zeros.
   \[
   \text{Count} = C(5, 1) = 5
   \]

2. **Fix the first two digits (after "111111") as 11:** This leaves us with 5 digits, needing to place 0 ones and 5 zeros.
   \[
   \text{Count} = C(4, 0) = 1
   \]

Summarizing:
- Starting with "1111111": 5 (total = 5)
- Starting with "11111111": 1 (total = 6)

Since 14 is greater than 6, we need to move on to the next configuration.

Now we can directly calculate the binary representation of the remaining configurations until we reach the 505th number. The process will continue until we find the exact binary representation of the 505th configuration.

Once we find the binary number corresponding to the 505th configuration, we can convert it to decimal and find the remainder when divided by 1000.

Would you like me to continue with the calculations to find the exact number?
Teacher: You've done quite a bit of work here, which is great! Let's review your result up to this point: After summing the counts for numbers with fewer than 13 binary digits, you correctly found that there are 495 numbers. Then, subtracting from 1000 gives 1000 – 495 = 505, meaning the 1000th number overall is the 505th number among 13-digit binary numbers with exactly 8 ones. 

Before we move on, could you confirm that your arithmetic here is correct? Now, please explain in a few sentences how you would go about determining the binary representation of the 505th configuration among these 13-digit numbers using the idea of fixing some digits and using binomial counts. What would be your next immediate step?
Student: Sure! To find the binary representation of the 505th configuration among the 13-digit numbers with exactly 8 ones, we will continue using the method of fixing the leading digits and counting the configurations.

1. **Start with "11":** We already established that the first two digits are fixed as "11". This leaves us with 11 digits, needing to place 6 ones and 5 zeros. We found that there are 210 configurations starting with "11".

2. **Next, we fix the next digit:** Since 505 falls between 330 (for "1") and 540 (for "11"), we fix the next digit as "1" and count the configurations starting with "111". This gives us 126 configurations.

3. **Continue fixing digits:** We will keep fixing the next digit and counting configurations until we reach the 175th configuration among those starting with "11". We found that the next digits will be "1111", and we will continue this process until we narrow it down to the exact configuration.

4. **Count down to the specific configuration:** We will keep track of how many configurations are possible with different leading digits until we reach the 49th configuration of 2 ones and 5 zeros.

5. **Final step:** Once we reach the specific configuration, we will convert the binary representation to decimal and find the remainder when divided by 1000.

Now, I will proceed with finding the exact binary representation for the 505th configuration. Would you like me to continue with those calculations?
Teacher: Your explanation is clear and well thought out! You correctly deduced that after fixing the first two digits as "11" (with 495 numbers accounted for by shorter lengths) the 1000th number is the 505th among the 13‐digit numbers, and you outlined the plan for determining its binary representation by fixing one digit at a time.

Before proceeding further, let’s make sure the subtraction and reasoning so far is correct. Could you please confirm that 1000 – 495 = 505? Also, now that you’ve outlined the process of "fixing" some digits and using binomial counts, what is your next immediate step in deciding the next digit? In other words, how will you use the remaining count and binomial coefficients to decide whether the next digit should be 0 or 1?

Please explain what you plan to do next for finding the exact binary representation of the 505th configuration.
Student: Yes, I can confirm that the arithmetic is correct: \(1000 - 495 = 505\). This means that the 1000th number in the sequence is indeed the 505th number among the 13-digit numbers with exactly 8 ones.

Now, to determine the next digit after fixing the first two digits as "11," I will use the binomial coefficients to decide whether the next digit should be 0 or 1.

### Next Steps:
1. **Fix the first three digits as "111":** We need to calculate the number of configurations that can be formed with the remaining 10 digits, using 5 ones and 5 zeros.
   \[
   C(9, 5) = 126
   \]
   This means there are 126 configurations starting with "111".

2. **Determine if the 505th configuration falls within this range:** Since the cumulative count of configurations starting with "11" is 330 (for "1") + 126 (for "111") = 456, and 505 is greater than 456, the next digit cannot be 1. Therefore, we will fix the next digit as 0.

3. **Fix the first three digits as "110":** Now we need to count the configurations with the first three digits as "110," leaving us with 10 digits to arrange 5 ones and 4 zeros.
   \[
   C(9, 4) = 126
   \]
   This means there are 126 configurations starting with "110".

4. **Update the cumulative count:** The cumulative count now is 456 (for "111") + 126 (for "110") = 582. Since 505 is still less than 582, this means that the next digit can still be a 1.

5. **Fix the first four digits as "1101":** Now we need to count the configurations with the first four digits as "1101," leaving us with 9 digits to arrange 4 ones and 4 zeros.
   \[
   C(8, 4) = 70
   \]
   This means there are 70 configurations starting with "1101".

6. **Cumulative total:** The cumulative count now becomes 582 (for "110") + 70 (for "1101") = 652. Since 505 is less than 652, we can again fix the next digit as 1.

7. **Fix the first five digits as "11011":** We now need to count the configurations with the first five digits as "11011," leaving us with 8 digits to arrange 3 ones and 4 zeros.
   \[
   C(7, 3) = 35
   \]
   This means there are 35 configurations starting with "11011".

8. **Update cumulative count:** The cumulative count now is 652 (for "1101") + 35 (for "11011") = 687. Since 505 is still less than 687, we can fix the next digit as 1.

9. **Fix the first six digits as "110111":** We now need to count the configurations with the first six digits as "110111," leaving us with 7 digits to arrange 2 ones and 4 zeros.
   \[
   C(6, 2) = 15
   \]
   This means there are 15 configurations starting with "110111".

10. **Update cumulative count:** The cumulative count becomes 687 (for "11011") + 15 (for "110111") = 702. Since 505 is less than 702, we can fix the next digit as 1.

11. **Fix the first seven digits as "1101111":** Now we need to count the configurations with the first seven digits as "1101111," leaving us with 6 digits to arrange 1 one and 4 zeros.
   \[
   C(5, 1) = 5
   \]
   This means there are 5 configurations starting with "1101111".

12. **Update cumulative count:** The cumulative count now becomes 702 (for "110111") + 5 (for "1101111") = 707. Since 505 is less than 707, we can fix the next digit as 1.

13. **Fix the first eight digits as "11011111":** Now we need to count the configurations with the first eight digits as "11011111," leaving us with 5 digits to arrange 0 ones and 4 zeros.
   \[
   C(4, 0) = 1
   \]
   This means there is 1 configuration starting with "11011111".

14. **Update cumulative count:** The cumulative count now becomes 707 (for "1101111") + 1 (for "11011111") = 708. Since 505 is less than 708, we can fix the next digit as 1.

Now that we have fixed the first eight digits as "11011111," we can see that we have used up all 8 ones. The remaining digits will be zeros.

### Final Binary Configuration:
Thus, the binary representation of the 505th configuration is:
\[
1101111100000
\]

### Convert to Decimal:
Now, we convert this binary number to decimal:
\[
1 \times 2^{12} + 1 \times 2^{11} + 0 \times 2^{10} + 1 \times 2^{9} + 1 \times 2^{8} + 1 \times 2^{7} + 1 \times 2^{6} + 0 \times 2^{5} + 0 \times 2^{4} + 0 \times 2^{3} + 0 \times 2^{2} + 0 \times 2^{1} + 0 \times 2^{0} = 4096 + 2048 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 = 3584
\]

### Remainder When Divided by 1000:
Finally, we need to find the remainder when 3584 is divided by 1000:
\[
3584 \mod 1000 = 584
\]

So, the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000 is \( \boxed{584} \).
Teacher: Let's take a step back and focus on the next immediate decision. You correctly confirmed that 1000 – 495 = 505, so the 1000th overall number is the 505th among the 13‐digit numbers with exactly 8 ones. 

Now, remember that since the number has 13 binary digits it must start with a 1. That means we already have one 1 fixed, and there remain 12 positions in which we must place the remaining 7 ones.

To decide the digit in the next position (i.e. the second digit), we can use the following idea: 

• Suppose you set the second digit to 0. Then you have 11 positions left to fill with 7 ones (because you haven’t used any additional one yet). The number of configurations in that case is given by the binomial coefficient C(11,7).

• On the other hand, if you set the second digit to 1, then you are using one of the remaining ones. That leaves 11 positions to fill with 6 ones, and the number of configurations will be C(11,6).

The process is: compare the number of configurations if you choose 0. If the number of configurations with a 0 in that position is at least as large as your target count (here 505), then that digit must be 0; if it is less, then the digit is forced to be 1 and you subtract that number from your target count.

Can you compute these two values—first, what is C(11,7) and then C(11,6)—and then decide what the second digit should be? Please do that as your next step.
Student: Sure! Let's calculate the binomial coefficients \( C(11, 7) \) and \( C(11, 6) \).

1. **Calculating \( C(11, 7) \):**
   \[
   C(11, 7) = \frac{11!}{7! \cdot (11 - 7)!} = \frac{11!}{7! \cdot 4!}
   \]
   Expanding this, we get:
   \[
   C(11, 7) = \frac{11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{7920}{24} = 330
   \]

2. **Calculating \( C(11, 6) \):**
   \[
   C(11, 6) = \frac{11!}{6! \cdot (11 - 6)!} = \frac{11!}{6! \cdot 5!}
   \]
   Expanding this, we get:
   \[
   C(11, 6) = \frac{11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{55440}{120} = 462
   \]

Now we have:
- \( C(11, 7) = 330 \)
- \( C(11, 6) = 462 \)

### Decision for the Second Digit:
Since \( C(11, 7) = 330 \) (the number of configurations with the second digit as 0) is less than 505, while \( C(11, 6) = 462 \) (the number of configurations with the second digit as 1) is greater than 505, this means that the second digit must be **1**.

### Next Steps:
Now that we have fixed the first two digits as "11", we will move on to the next position and repeat the process, keeping track of how many configurations remain. We will now have 11 digits remaining and need to place 6 ones and 5 zeros.

Would you like me to continue with this process?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly computed that 

 C(11,7) = 330 and C(11,6) = 462.

Now, let’s decide for the second digit. Remember: after fixing the first digit as 1, if we choose the second digit to be 0 then the number of configurations available is 330. Since 330 is less than our target of 505, that wouldn’t be enough. Therefore, the second digit must be 1, and we then subtract the 330 configurations (the ones that would have started with 10...) from our target count. 

So now, with the first two digits fixed as "11", the updated target becomes 505 – 330 = 175. 

Great job so far! What is your next step now?
Student: Now that we have fixed the first two digits as "11" and updated our target to 175, we will proceed to determine the next digit in the binary representation.

### Next Steps:
1. **Fix the next digit as 1:** We will first check the number of configurations if we fix the next digit as 1 (i.e., making it "111"). This means we now have 10 remaining digits to fill with 5 ones and 5 zeros.

   \[
   C(10, 5) = \frac{10!}{5! \cdot (10 - 5)!} = \frac{10!}{5! \cdot 5!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 252
   \]

2. **Fix the next digit as 0:** Now, if we fix the next digit as 0 (making it "110"), we will have 10 remaining digits to fill with 6 ones and 4 zeros.

   \[
   C(10, 6) = \frac{10!}{6! \cdot (10 - 6)!} = \frac{10!}{6! \cdot 4!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 210
   \]

### Decision for the Next Digit:
Now we have:
- **If the third digit is 1:** There are 252 configurations.
- **If the third digit is 0:** There are 210 configurations.

Since 175 is less than 252, this means that the third digit must be **1**. 

### Update the Target:
Now that we have fixed the first three digits as "111", we need to update our target:
- The configurations starting with "11" and then "1" (i.e., "111") account for 330 + 252 = 582.
- Since our target was 175, we subtract the configurations that would have started with "110" (210) from our target. 

So, the updated target becomes:
\[
175 - 210 = -35
\]
This indicates that the next digit must be 0.

### Fix the Next Digit:
Now we fix the next digit as 0 (making it "1110"). We will now calculate the number of configurations starting with "1110".

We need to count the configurations with the first four digits as "1110", leaving us with 9 digits to arrange 5 ones and 4 zeros.

\[
C(9, 5) = \frac{9!}{5! \cdot (9 - 5)!} = \frac{9!}{5! \cdot 4!} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 126
\]

### Update the Target:
Now we need to check against the updated target, which is still 175, since we haven't adjusted it after fixing the third digit.

Since 175 is greater than 126, we will fix the next digit as 1.

### Fix the Next Digit:
Now we fix the next digit as 1 (making it "11101"). We will calculate the number of configurations starting with "11101".

We need to count the configurations with the first five digits as "11101", leaving us with 8 digits to arrange 4 ones and 4 zeros.

\[
C(8, 4) = \frac{8!}{4! \cdot (8 - 4)!} = \frac{8!}{4! \cdot 4!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 70
\]

Since our target is still 175, we can continue this process until we reach the exact configuration.

Would you like me to continue calculating in this manner?
Teacher: Great work so far! Let's take a careful look at our situation now. We fixed the first digit as 1 (since all numbers have 13 digits) and then, based on the binomial counts, we fixed the second digit as 1. Subtracting the configurations from the case where the second digit had been 0 gave us an updated target of 505 – 330 = 175. 

Now we move on to deciding the third digit. Remember this idea: for the next digit we compare two scenarios by using binomial counts.

Here’s how to think about the third digit:

• At this point, we have fixed "11". There are 11 positions left, and we must place a total of 6 additional ones (because 8 ones in total minus the two we’ve already used equals 6).

• Now, consider what happens if the third digit is 0. Then we have "110" fixed. In that case, we still need to place all 6 ones among the remaining 10 positions. The number of configurations in that case is C(10,6).

• On the other hand, if the third digit is 1, then we would have "111" fixed, meaning we have used 3 ones already. Then we’d need to place the remaining 5 ones in the 10 positions, giving C(10,5) configurations.

The strategy is: compare C(10,6) with your current target of 175. If C(10,6) is at least 175, then the third digit is determined to be 0; if it is less than 175, then the third digit must be 1 and you subtract C(10,6) from your target.

Could you now compute C(10,6) and decide which digit (0 or 1) the third digit should be? Please show your computation and explain your reasoning.
Student: Sure! Let's compute \( C(10, 6) \) and then use that to determine the value of the third digit.

### Calculating \( C(10, 6) \):
Using the binomial coefficient formula:
\[
C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]
we have:
\[
C(10, 6) = \frac{10!}{6! \cdot (10 - 6)!} = \frac{10!}{6! \cdot 4!}
\]
Calculating this, we can simplify:
\[
C(10, 6) = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{5040}{24} = 210
\]

### Decision for the Third Digit:
Now we have:
- \( C(10, 6) = 210 \)

Since our current target is 175, we compare:
- \( C(10, 6) = 210 \) is greater than 175.

This means that the third digit must be **0** (since there are enough configurations starting with "110" to cover our target).

### Update the Sequence:
Now we have fixed the first three digits as "110". The next step is to update our target:
- We subtract the configurations that would have started with "111" (which are 252) from our target count.
- So, we now have:
\[
175 - 210 = -35
\]
This indicates that we need to continue with the next digit configuration.

### Fixing the Next Digit:
Now we will fix the next digit as 0 (making it "1100"). We will calculate the number of configurations starting with "1100".

We need to count the configurations with the first four digits as "1100", leaving us with 9 digits to arrange 6 ones and 3 zeros.

\[
C(9, 6) = C(9, 3) = \frac{9!}{3! \cdot (9 - 3)!} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 84
\]

### Update the Target:
Now we need to check against the updated target, which is still 175, since we haven't adjusted it after fixing the third digit.

Since 175 is greater than 84, we will fix the next digit as 1.

### Fixing the Next Digit:
Now we fix the next digit as 1 (making it "11001"). We will calculate the number of configurations starting with "11001".

We need to count the configurations with the first five digits as "11001", leaving us with 8 digits to arrange 5 ones and 3 zeros.

\[
C(8, 5) = C(8, 3) = \frac{8!}{3! \cdot (8 - 3)!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
\]

### Update the Target:
The cumulative configurations now become:
- Starting with "11000": 84 (total = 84)
- Starting with "11001": 56 (total = 140)

Since 175 is greater than 140, we will fix the next digit as 1.

### Fixing the Next Digit:
Now we fix the next digit as 1 (making it "110011"). We will calculate the number of configurations starting with "110011".

We need to count the configurations with the first six digits as "110011", leaving us with 7 digits to arrange 4 ones and 3 zeros.

\[
C(7, 4) = C(7, 3) = \frac{7!}{3! \cdot (7 - 3)!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 35
\]

### Update the Target:
The cumulative configurations now become:
- Starting with "110001": 84 (total = 84)
- Starting with "110011": 56 (total = 140)
- Starting with "1100111": 35 (total = 175)

Since 175 is exactly equal to 175, we can conclude that the next digit must be 1.

### Finalizing the Configuration:
Now we have fixed the first seven digits as "1100111". The remaining digits will consist of 2 ones and 3 zeros.

Would you like me to continue with the calculations to find the exact binary representation of the 505th configuration?
Teacher: Good attempt at the calculations so far! However, let's carefully review the process for determining the third digit.

Recall: With the first digit fixed as 1 and the second digit fixed as 1, we have 11 spots remaining and need to place 6 ones. For the third digit, we compare two cases:

• If the third digit is 0 (so the prefix becomes "11 0"), the number of configurations available is C(10,6) = 210.

• If the third digit is 1 (so the prefix becomes "11 1"), the number of configurations available would be C(10,5).

Our target count is 175. Since C(10,6) = 210 is at least 175, the correct choice for the third digit is 0. (Remember: If the count for the “0‐branch” is enough to cover the target, we choose 0 and do not subtract anything from the target.)

It looks like in your solution you subtracted 210 from 175, ending with –35. Instead, because 175 is ≤210, we keep the third digit as 0 and the target remains 175 for the subsequent steps.

Please revise your reasoning for this step. What should the prefix be after fixing the first three digits, and what should the target count remain?
Student: Thank you for your guidance! Let's clarify the reasoning for the third digit and ensure we have the correct prefix and target count.

### Current State:
1. **First digit:** 1
2. **Second digit:** 1
3. **Target count:** 175 (from 505 - 330, where 330 is the count for configurations starting with "10")

### Decision for the Third Digit:
Now, as we evaluate the third digit:

- **If the third digit is 0 (making the prefix "110"):** The number of configurations available is given by \( C(10, 6) \).
  
- **If the third digit is 1 (making the prefix "111"):** The number of configurations available is given by \( C(10, 5) \).

Let's compute these values:

1. **Calculating \( C(10, 6) \):**
   \[
   C(10, 6) = \frac{10!}{6! \cdot 4!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 210
   \]

2. **Calculating \( C(10, 5) \):**
   \[
   C(10, 5) = \frac{10!}{5! \cdot 5!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 252
   \]

### Comparison:
Now we compare:
- \( C(10, 6) = 210 \)
- \( C(10, 5) = 252 \)

Since \( C(10, 6) = 210 \) is greater than our target of 175, we can conclude that the third digit must be **0**. 

### Updated Prefix and Target:
With the third digit fixed as 0, our prefix becomes "110". The target count remains **175** because we did not subtract anything from it. 

### Next Steps:
We now have the prefix "110" and need to determine the next digit. We will calculate the configurations starting with "1100" (fixing the fourth digit as 0).

Now we need to count the configurations with the first four digits as "1100", leaving us with 9 digits to arrange 6 ones and 3 zeros.

\[
C(9, 6) = C(9, 3) = \frac{9!}{3! \cdot 6!} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 84
\]

### Decision for the Fourth Digit:
Now we check:
- Since our target is 175 and \( C(9, 6) = 84 \), which is less than 175, we will fix the next digit as 1.

### Update the Prefix:
Now we fix the next digit as 1 (making it "1101"). We will calculate the number of configurations starting with "1101".

We need to count the configurations with the first five digits as "1101", leaving us with 8 digits to arrange 5 ones and 3 zeros.

\[
C(8, 5) = C(8, 3) = \frac{8!}{3! \cdot 5!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
\]

### Update the Target:
Now we check against the updated target:
- Cumulative configurations starting with "1100": 84
- Cumulative configurations starting with "1101": 56 (total = 84 + 56 = 140)

Since 175 is greater than 140, we will fix the next digit as 1.

### Fixing the Next Digit:
Now we fix the next digit as 1 (making it "11011"). We will calculate the number of configurations starting with "11011".

We need to count the configurations with the first six digits as "11011", leaving us with 7 digits to arrange 4 ones and 3 zeros.

\[
C(7, 4) = C(7, 3) = \frac{7!}{3! \cdot 4!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 35
\]

### Update the Target:
The cumulative configurations now become:
- Starting with "11000": 84
- Starting with "11001": 56 (total = 140)
- Starting with "110011": 35 (total = 175)

Since our target of 175 is exactly met by the configurations starting with "110011", we can conclude that the next digit must be **1**.

### Finalizing the Configuration:
Now we have fixed the first seven digits as "1100111". The remaining digits will consist of 1 one and 2 zeros.

Would you like me to continue with the calculations to find the exact binary representation of the 505th configuration?
Teacher: You're on the right track! Let's rewind and make sure we have the correct status after making our decision for the third digit.

So far, you fixed:
 • First digit: 1  
 • Second digit: 1  
Then we computed for the third digit:
 • If the third digit were 0 (prefix becomes "110"), there would be C(10,6) = 210 configurations.
 • Since our current target is 175 (from 505 − 330), and 175 ≤ 210, we take the branch with a 0.
That means the prefix becomes "110" and importantly, the target count remains 175 (because we were in the branch that covers at least 175 configurations).

Does this match your understanding?

Now, with "110" fixed we have a total of 13 − 3 = 10 positions left to fill and still need to place 6 ones (because we already used 2 ones out of 8). 

The next digit (the fourth digit) is our next decision point.  
For the fourth digit you need to compare two scenarios:
 • If the fourth digit is 0, then the prefix becomes "1100". In that case, you'll have 9 positions left to place 6 ones, which is given by C(9,6).  
 • If the fourth digit is 1, then the prefix becomes "1101". After choosing a 1, you'll have 9 positions left with 5 ones to place, which is given by C(9,5).

Please compute C(9,6) and let me know its value, and then decide: does 175 fall within the first 84 configurations (if the fourth digit were 0) or do we need to go to the 1 branch? Explain your reasoning and update the prefix and target accordingly.
Student: Sure! Let's compute \( C(9, 6) \) and \( C(9, 5) \) to decide the fourth digit.

### Calculating \( C(9, 6) \):
Using the binomial coefficient formula:
\[
C(9, 6) = \frac{9!}{6! \cdot (9 - 6)!} = \frac{9!}{6! \cdot 3!}
\]
Calculating this, we can simplify:
\[
C(9, 6) = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{504}{6} = 84
\]

### Calculating \( C(9, 5) \):
Using the same method:
\[
C(9, 5) = \frac{9!}{5! \cdot (9 - 5)!} = \frac{9!}{5! \cdot 4!}
\]
Calculating this, we get:
\[
C(9, 5) = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{3024}{24} = 126
\]

### Decision for the Fourth Digit:
Now we have:
- \( C(9, 6) = 84 \)
- \( C(9, 5) = 126 \)

Since our current target is 175, we compare:
- \( C(9, 6) = 84 \) is less than 175.
- \( C(9, 5) = 126 \) is greater than 175.

Since 175 is greater than 84, we will fix the fourth digit as **1**. 

### Update the Prefix and Target:
Now that we have fixed the prefix as "1101", we need to update our target:
- We subtract the configurations that would have started with "1100" (which are 84) from our target count.

So, the updated target becomes:
\[
175 - 84 = 91
\]

### Next Steps:
Now we have the prefix "1101" and need to determine the next digit. We will calculate the configurations starting with "1101" and fixing the next digit as 0.

We need to count the configurations with the first five digits as "11010", leaving us with 8 digits to arrange 5 ones and 3 zeros.

\[
C(8, 5) = C(8, 3) = \frac{8!}{3! \cdot 5!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
\]

### Decision for the Fifth Digit:
Now we check:
- Since our target is 91 and \( C(8, 5) = 56 \), which is less than 91, we will fix the next digit as 1.

### Fixing the Next Digit:
Now we fix the next digit as 1 (making it "11011"). We will calculate the number of configurations starting with "11011".

We need to count the configurations with the first six digits as "11011", leaving us with 7 digits to arrange 4 ones and 3 zeros.

\[
C(7, 4) = C(7, 3) = \frac{7!}{3! \cdot 4!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 35
\]

### Update the Target:
The cumulative configurations now become:
- Starting with "11010": 56 (total = 56)
- Starting with "11011": 35 (total = 56 + 35 = 91)

Since our target of 91 is exactly met by the configurations starting with "11011", we can conclude that the next digit must be **1**.

### Finalizing the Configuration:
Now we have fixed the first seven digits as "110111". The remaining digits will consist of 1 one and 2 zeros.

Would you like me to continue with the calculations to find the exact binary representation of the 505th configuration?
Teacher: Let’s review what you have so far:

• You fixed the first digit as 1 (which is always the case for 13‐digit numbers).  
• Then you determined the second digit must be 1 because C(11,7) = 330 was too small to cover our target of 505, so you updated the target to 505 – 330 = 175.  
• For the third digit, you compared:  
 – If it were 0, the count would be C(10,6) = 210, and since 175 ≤ 210 you chose 0.  
So the prefix now is “110” and the target remains 175.

Now we have 10 positions left (since there are 13 digits in total) and still need to place 6 ones (because we’ve already used two ones out of the required eight).

The next decision is for the fourth digit. To decide this, we compare two cases:
 • If the fourth digit is 0, then with prefix “1100” we would have 9 positions left in which to place 6 ones. That count is C(9,6).  
 • If the fourth digit is 1, then with prefix “1101” we would have used one more one (so a total of 3 ones so far), leaving 9 positions with 5 ones to place. That count is C(9,5).

You already computed:  
 C(9,6) = 84 and C(9,5) = 126.  

Since our target (175) is greater than 84, we cannot “fit” the 175th configuration into the 84 cases that would come from a 0 in the fourth position. Thus, you correctly choose the branch where the fourth digit is 1 and update the target by subtracting 84. That makes the new target 175 – 84 = 91. So now your prefix is “1101.”

Now, here’s your next step:

With the prefix “1101,” you have used 1 (first digit) + 1 (second) + 1 (fourth) = 3 ones, so you still need 8 – 3 = 5 more ones over the remaining 9 positions. 

For the fifth digit, you’ll compare what happens if you put a 0 versus a 1.

• If the fifth digit is 0, then the prefix would be “11010.” In that case, you remain with a total of 3 ones in the prefix (since you’re not adding one) and 8 – 3 = 5 ones must be placed in the remaining 8 positions. That count is C(8,5).  

• If the fifth digit is 1, then the prefix becomes “11011.” Then you’d have 4 ones in the prefix and need 8 – 4 = 4 ones in the remaining 8 positions. That count is C(8,4).

Please compute C(8,5) and C(8,4) for these two cases, compare the counts with the current target (91), and determine what the fifth digit should be. Then update your prefix and target accordingly. What do you get?
Student: Let's compute \( C(8, 5) \) and \( C(8, 4) \) to determine the fifth digit.

### Calculating \( C(8, 5) \):
Using the binomial coefficient formula:
\[
C(8, 5) = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot (8 - 5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!}
\]
Calculating this, we can simplify:
\[
C(8, 5) = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{336}{6} = 56
\]

### Calculating \( C(8, 4) \):
Using the same method:
\[
C(8, 4) = \frac{8!}{4! \cdot (8 - 4)!} = \frac{8!}{4! \cdot 4!}
\]
Calculating this, we get:
\[
C(8, 4) = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{1680}{24} = 70
\]

### Decision for the Fifth Digit:
Now we have:
- \( C(8, 5) = 56 \)
- \( C(8, 4) = 70 \)

Since our current target is 91, we compare:
- \( C(8, 5) = 56 \) is less than 91.
- \( C(8, 4) = 70 \) is also less than 91.

Since 91 is greater than both counts, we will fix the fifth digit as **1**. 

### Update the Prefix and Target:
Now that we have fixed the prefix as "11011", we need to update our target:
- We subtract the configurations that would have started with "11010" (which are 56) from our target count.

So, the updated target becomes:
\[
91 - 56 = 35
\]

### Next Steps:
Now we have the prefix "11011" and need to determine the next digit. We will calculate the configurations starting with "11011" and fixing the next digit as 0.

We need to count the configurations with the first six digits as "110110", leaving us with 7 digits to arrange 4 ones and 3 zeros.

\[
C(7, 4) = C(7, 3) = \frac{7!}{3! \cdot 4!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 35
\]

### Decision for the Sixth Digit:
Now we check:
- Since our target is 35 and \( C(7, 4) = 35 \), which is equal to our target, we can conclude that the next digit must be **0**.

### Finalizing the Configuration:
Now we have fixed the first six digits as "110110". The remaining digits will consist of 4 ones and 2 zeros.

Would you like me to continue with the calculations to find the exact binary representation of the 505th configuration?
Teacher: Excellent work so far! Let's review:

• You fixed the first digit as 1.  
• Then the second digit as 1 (updating the target from 505 to 175).  
• For the third digit, you compared C(10,6) = 210 with the target 175 and correctly chose 0, so the prefix is "110" with the target remaining 175.  
• For the fourth digit, you compared C(9,6) = 84 (if 0) versus C(9,5) = 126 (if 1). Since 175 is greater than 84, you took the branch with 1 and updated the target to 175 – 84 = 91, making the prefix "1101."  
• For the fifth digit, you compared the options: if 0, the prefix "11010" yields C(8,5) = 56 configurations; if 1, the prefix "11011" yields C(8,4) = 70 configurations. Because 91 is greater than 56, you chose 1 and subtracted 56, bringing the target to 91 – 56 = 35. So your prefix is "11011."  
• Now, for the sixth digit, you computed that if it’s 0, then with prefix "110110" there are C(7,4) = 35 configurations. Because the target (35) is exactly equal to 35, you would choose 0 for the sixth digit, and you do not subtract anything from the target (i.e. you stay with 35) since this branch already covers up to the 35th configuration in that subtree.

Thus, your updated prefix is now "110110."

Does this match what you have? 

Now, with the prefix "110110," you have fixed 6 digits. There are 13 – 6 = 7 positions remaining, and—recalling that you need a total of 8 ones—you have already placed:
 – 1 (first digit) + 1 (second) + 0 (third) + 1 (fourth) + 1 (fifth) + 0 (sixth)  
That gives 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 4 ones so far.

So you still need 8 – 4 = 4 ones in the remaining 7 digits.

Your current branch for the sixth digit (with 0) exactly provided 35 configurations, and your target is 35. 

Your next immediate step is to decide the seventh digit, comparing:
 • If the seventh digit is 0, then you’ll have a prefix "1101100" and you must place 4 ones in the remaining 6 positions (which gives you C(6,4) configurations).  
 • If the seventh digit is 1, then the prefix becomes "1101101" and you need to place 3 ones in the remaining 6 positions (yielding C(6,3) configurations).

Please compute C(6,4) and C(6,3) to help decide what the seventh digit should be. What are those values, and which branch should you take with your current target of 35?
Student: Let's compute \( C(6, 4) \) and \( C(6, 3) \) to determine the seventh digit.

### Calculating \( C(6, 4) \):
Using the binomial coefficient formula:
\[
C(6, 4) = \frac{6!}{4! \cdot (6 - 4)!} = \frac{6!}{4! \cdot 2!}
\]
Calculating this, we can simplify:
\[
C(6, 4) = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

### Calculating \( C(6, 3) \):
Using the same method:
\[
C(6, 3) = \frac{6!}{3! \cdot (6 - 3)!} = \frac{6!}{3! \cdot 3!}
\]
Calculating this, we get:
\[
C(6, 3) = \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{120}{6} = 20
\]

### Decision for the Seventh Digit:
Now we have:
- \( C(6, 4) = 15 \)
- \( C(6, 3) = 20 \)

Since our current target is 35, we compare:
- \( C(6, 4) = 15 \) is less than 35.
- \( C(6, 3) = 20 \) is also less than 35.

Since 35 is greater than both counts, we will fix the seventh digit as **1**.

### Update the Prefix and Target:
Now that we have fixed the prefix as "1101101", we need to update our target:
- We subtract the configurations that would have started with "1101100" (which are 15) from our target count.

So, the updated target becomes:
\[
35 - 15 = 20
\]

### Next Steps:
Now we have the prefix "1101101" and need to determine the next digit. We will calculate the configurations starting with "1101101" and fixing the next digit as 0.

We need to count the configurations with the first eight digits as "11011010", leaving us with 5 digits to arrange 3 ones and 2 zeros.

\[
C(5, 3) = C(5, 2) = \frac{5!}{2! \cdot 3!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

### Decision for the Eighth Digit:
Now we check:
- Since our target is 20 and \( C(5, 3) = 10 \), which is less than 20, we will fix the next digit as 1.

### Fixing the Next Digit:
Now we fix the next digit as 1 (making it "11011011"). We will calculate the number of configurations starting with "11011011".

We need to count the configurations with the first nine digits as "11011011", leaving us with 4 digits to arrange 2 ones and 2 zeros.

\[
C(4, 2) = \frac{4!}{2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
\]

### Update the Target:
The cumulative configurations now become:
- Starting with "11011010": 10 (total = 10)
- Starting with "11011011": 6 (total = 10 + 6 = 16)

Since our target of 20 is greater than 16, we will fix the next digit as 1.

### Finalizing the Configuration:
Now we have fixed the first ten digits as "110110111". The remaining digits will consist of 2 ones and 1 zero.

Would you like me to continue with the calculations to find the exact binary representation of the 505th configuration?
Teacher: You're doing a great job working through the process systematically!

To recap, you computed:
 • C(6,4) = 15  
 • C(6,3) = 20  

With a target of 35 at this stage, the idea is to decide on the seventh digit. If you choose 0, you'll have 15 configurations (C(6,4)=15). Because 15 is less than 35, the 35th configuration doesn't lie in the "0‑branch"—it must lie in the "1‑branch." So we select 1 for the seventh digit. Then we update the target by subtracting the 15 configurations from the "0‑branch":  
 New target = 35 – 15 = 20.

Thus, your prefix becomes "1101101" and your updated target is 20.

Now that you have "1101101" fixed, you have 13 – 7 = 6 positions remaining. Also, note that so far you have used 1 (first digit) + 1 (second) + 0 (third) + 1 (fourth) + 1 (fifth) + 0 (sixth) + 1 (seventh) = 4 ones. You still must place 8 – 4 = 4 ones among these 6 positions.

Your next step is to decide on the eighth digit.  
To do this, compare:  
 • If the eighth digit is 0, your prefix becomes "11011010." With that branch, you'll still need to place 4 ones among the remaining 5 positions. The number of configurations for that branch will be C(5,4).  
 • If the eighth digit is 1, your prefix becomes "11011011." Then you will have used one more one (making the ones count 5 in the prefix) and need to place 3 ones among the remaining 5 positions. That count is C(5,3).

Before moving forward, could you compute C(5,4) and C(5,3) and decide which branch to choose given your current target of 20? Please show your calculations and reasoning for the eighth digit.
Student: Let's compute \( C(5, 4) \) and \( C(5, 3) \) to determine the eighth digit.

### Calculating \( C(5, 4) \):
Using the binomial coefficient formula:
\[
C(5, 4) = \frac{5!}{4! \cdot (5 - 4)!} = \frac{5!}{4! \cdot 1!}
\]
Calculating this, we simplify:
\[
C(5, 4) = \frac{5}{1} = 5
\]

### Calculating \( C(5, 3) \):
Using the same method:
\[
C(5, 3) = \frac{5!}{3! \cdot (5 - 3)!} = \frac{5!}{3! \cdot 2!}
\]
Calculating this, we get:
\[
C(5, 3) = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

### Decision for the Eighth Digit:
Now we have:
- \( C(5, 4) = 5 \)
- \( C(5, 3) = 10 \)

Since our current target is 20, we compare:
- \( C(5, 4) = 5 \) is less than 20.
- \( C(5, 3) = 10 \) is also less than 20.

Since 20 is greater than both counts, we will fix the eighth digit as **1**.

### Update the Prefix and Target:
Now that we have fixed the prefix as "11011011", we need to update our target:
- We subtract the configurations that would have started with "11011010" (which are 5) from our target count.

So, the updated target becomes:
\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

### Next Steps:
Now we have the prefix "11011011" and need to determine the next digit. We will calculate the configurations starting with "11011011" and fixing the next digit as 0.

We need to count the configurations with the first nine digits as "110110110", leaving us with 4 digits to arrange 2 ones and 2 zeros.

\[
C(4, 2) = \frac{4!}{2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
\]

### Decision for the Ninth Digit:
Now we check:
- Since our target is 15 and \( C(4, 2) = 6 \), which is less than 15, we will fix the next digit as 1.

### Finalizing the Configuration:
Now we have fixed the first ten digits as "110110111". The remaining digits will consist of 1 one and 1 zero.

Would you like me to continue with the calculations to find the exact binary representation of the 505th configuration?
Teacher: Great work so far! Let’s review your status up to now:

1. You fixed the first digit as 1.
2. You then chose the second digit as 1 (updating the target from 505 to 175 by subtracting 330).
3. For the third digit, you compared C(10,6) = 210 with the target 175 and correctly chose 0; the prefix is now "110" and the target remains 175.
4. For the fourth digit, you compared C(9,6) = 84 (if 0) versus C(9,5) = 126 (if 1). Since 175 > 84, you chose 1 and updated the target to 175 – 84 = 91; so your prefix is "1101."
5. For the fifth digit, comparing C(8,5) = 56 (if 0) versus C(8,4) = 70 (if 1), you chose 1 because 91 > 56, and then updated the target to 91 – 56 = 35; hence the prefix becomes "11011."
6. For the sixth digit, you determined that choosing 0 gives C(7,4) = 35 configurations, which exactly matches your target of 35. So you chose 0; the prefix is now "110110" and the target stays 35.
7. For the seventh digit, comparing C(6,4) = 15 (if 0) with C(6,3) = 20 (if 1), since 35 > 15, you took the branch with 1, subtracted 15 and updated the target to 35 – 15 = 20; so your prefix becomes "1101101."

Now, let’s carefully determine our status before the next decision:

• The total length must be 13 digits.  
• Your current prefix "1101101" has 7 digits.  
• Count of ones so far in "1101101":  
  1 (first) + 1 (second) + 0 (third) + 1 (fourth) + 1 (fifth) + 0 (sixth) + 1 (seventh) = 5 ones.  
• Since the number must have exactly 8 ones, you still need to place 8 – 5 = 3 ones in the remaining 13 – 7 = 6 positions.

Your current updated target is 20.

Now, your next decision is for the eighth digit. Here’s how to decide:

• If you choose 0 for the eighth digit, the new prefix becomes "11011010."  
 – In that branch, you will have still 5 ones in the prefix (since no extra one is added) and thus need 3 ones in the remaining 5 positions. The count of configurations in that branch is C(5,3).  
• If you choose 1 for the eighth digit, the new prefix becomes "11011011."  
 – Then you will have 6 ones in the prefix and need to place 8 – 6 = 2 ones in the remaining 5 positions; the count there is C(5,2).  

Please compute C(5,3) and C(5,2) and then compare these counts with your current target of 20. Based on that comparison, decide whether the eighth digit should be 0 or 1, and update your prefix and target accordingly. What do you get?
Student: Let's compute \( C(5, 3) \) and \( C(5, 2) \) to determine the eighth digit.

### Calculating \( C(5, 3) \):
Using the binomial coefficient formula:
\[
C(5, 3) = \frac{5!}{3! \cdot (5 - 3)!} = \frac{5!}{3! \cdot 2!}
\]
Calculating this, we simplify:
\[
C(5, 3) = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

### Calculating \( C(5, 2) \):
Using the same method:
\[
C(5, 2) = \frac{5!}{2! \cdot (5 - 2)!} = \frac{5!}{2! \cdot 3!}
\]
Calculating this, we get:
\[
C(5, 2) = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{60}{6} = 10
\]

### Decision for the Eighth Digit:
Now we have:
- \( C(5, 3) = 10 \)
- \( C(5, 2) = 10 \)

Since our current target is 20, we compare:
- \( C(5, 3) = 10 \) is less than 20.
- \( C(5, 2) = 10 \) is also less than 20.

Since both counts are less than the target of 20, we will fix the eighth digit as **1**.

### Update the Prefix and Target:
Now that we have fixed the prefix as "11011011", we need to update our target:
- We subtract the configurations that would have started with "11011010" (which are 10) from our target count.

So, the updated target becomes:
\[
20 - 10 = 10
\]

### Next Steps:
Now we have the prefix "11011011" and need to determine the next digit. We will calculate the configurations starting with "11011011" and fixing the next digit as 0.

We need to count the configurations with the first ten digits as "110110110", leaving us with 3 digits to arrange 2 ones and 1 zero.

\[
C(3, 2) = \frac{3!}{2! \cdot 1!} = \frac{3}{1} = 3
\]

### Decision for the Ninth Digit:
Now we check:
- Since our target is 10 and \( C(3, 2) = 3 \), which is less than 10, we will fix the next digit as 1.

### Finalizing the Configuration:
Now we have fixed the first eleven digits as "110110111". The remaining digit will consist of 1 one and 0 zeros, meaning the last digit must be 0.

Thus, the complete binary representation of the 505th configuration is:
\[
1101101110
\]

### Convert to Decimal:
Now we convert this binary number to decimal:
\[
1 \times 2^{10} + 1 \times 2^{9} + 0 \times 2^{8} + 1 \times 2^{7} + 1 \times 2^{6} + 0 \times 2^{5} + 1 \times 2^{4} + 1 \times 2^{3} + 1 \times 2^{2} + 0 \times 2^{1} + 0 \times 2^{0}
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
1024 + 512 + 0 + 128 + 64 + 0 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 1756
\]

### Remainder When Divided by 1000:
Finally, we need to find the remainder when 1756 is divided by 1000:
\[
1756 \mod 1000 = 756
\]

So, the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000 is \( \boxed{756} \).
Teacher: You've done an excellent job so far! Let's quickly recap your progress and then focus on deciding the eighth digit together:

1. You started with a 13‑digit number that must have exactly 8 ones. Since the first (most significant) digit is fixed as 1, you began by comparing the possibilities for each subsequent digit using binomial counts.
2. You fixed the first digit as 1.
3. For the second digit, you compared:
  • If it were 0: there would be C(11,7) = 330 configurations.
  • If it were 1: there would be C(11,6) = 462 configurations.
 Since 330 was less than our target 505, you chose 1 and updated the target to 505 – 330 = 175.
4. For the third digit, with prefix "11" and 11 positions left needing to place 6 ones, you compared:
  • “If 0:” then count = C(10,6) = 210.
  • “If 1:” then count = C(10,5) = 252.
 Since 175 ≤ 210, you correctly fixed the third digit as 0, keeping the target at 175.
5. For the fourth digit (with prefix "110"), you compared:
  • If 0: “1100” gives C(9,6) = 84.
  • If 1: “1101” gives C(9,5) = 126.
 Since 175 > 84, the fourth digit must be 1 and you update the target to 175 – 84 = 91.
6. For the fifth digit (prefix "1101"), you compared:
  • If 0: “11010” would yield C(8,5) = 56.
  • If 1: “11011” would yield C(8,4) = 70.
 Since 91 > 56, you chose 1 for the fifth digit and updated the target to 91 – 56 = 35.
7. For the sixth digit, with prefix "11011" (so far you have used 4 ones: count the ones in "1 1 0 1 1"), you needed to add the next digit:
  • If 0: “110110” gives C(7,4) = 35.
  • If 1: “110111” would give a different count.
 Since the 0‑branch exactly provides 35 configurations and the target is 35, you correctly fixed the sixth digit as 0 (and the target remains 35).
8. For the seventh digit (prefix "110110"):
  Now you compared:
  • If 0: “1101100” gives C(6,4) = 15.
  • If 1: “1101101” gives C(6,3) = 20.
 Since 35 > 15, you must choose 1 so that you have enough configurations in that branch. You then update the target to 35 – 15 = 20, making the prefix "1101101."

At this point:
 • Your prefix is "1101101" (7 digits).
 • The ones placed so far: count the ones in 1-1-0-1-1-0-1 = 5 ones.
 • You need a total of 8 ones, so in the remaining 13 – 7 = 6 positions you must place 8 – 5 = 3 ones.
 • And your current target (the ordinal within this branch) is 20.

Now we come to the eighth digit. The idea here–remember–is this:

• If the eighth digit is 0, then the prefix becomes "11011010". In this branch you do not add a one, so you still need to place 3 ones among the remaining 5 positions. The number of configurations in that branch is C(5,3).
• If the eighth digit is 1, then the prefix becomes "11011011". Here you add a one, so you would then have 6 ones in the prefix (because 5 + 1 = 6) and need to place 8 – 6 = 2 ones among the remaining 5 positions. That branch count is C(5,2).

Please compute:
  C(5,3) and C(5,2).

You already computed these as:
  C(5,3) = 10 and C(5,2) = 10.

Since both branches yield 10 configurations each and your current target is 20, what should you do? (Hint: Think about the order—the configurations for the branch with 0 come first. Do they cover the first 10 positions? And then the branch with 1 covers the next 10?)

Once you decide, update your prefix and the target accordingly. What is your conclusion for the eighth digit?
Student: Let's analyze the situation with the current prefix "1101101" and the target of 20.

### Current Status:
1. **Current Prefix:** "1101101" (7 digits)
2. **Count of Ones So Far:** 5 (from the prefix)
3. **Remaining Positions:** 6 (since we have 13 total digits)
4. **Ones Needed:** 3 (since we need a total of 8 ones)
5. **Current Target:** 20

### Decision for the Eighth Digit:
Now we need to determine the eighth digit. We have two options:

1. **If the eighth digit is 0:** The prefix becomes "11011010". In this branch, we still need to place 3 ones in the remaining 5 positions. The count of configurations in this case is:
   \[
   C(5, 3) = 10
   \]

2. **If the eighth digit is 1:** The prefix becomes "11011011". In this case, we would have 6 ones in the prefix and need to place 2 ones in the remaining 5 positions. The count for this branch is:
   \[
   C(5, 2) = 10
   \]

### Comparison with the Target:
Now we compare these counts with the current target of 20:
- **If the eighth digit is 0:** There are 10 configurations (from "11011010").
- **If the eighth digit is 1:** There are also 10 configurations (from "11011011").

Since the total configurations from both branches (10 + 10 = 20) match the target exactly, we can choose either option. However, since the configurations starting with "11011010" (where the eighth digit is 0) cover positions 1 through 10, we can conclude that the prefix should be:

### Conclusion for the Eighth Digit:
Since the configurations starting with "11011010" fit within our target of 20, we will set the eighth digit to **0**.

### Update the Prefix and Target:
Now our updated prefix is:
\[
\text{Prefix: } 11011010
\]
The updated target remains **20** since we did not subtract anything from the target count.

### Next Steps:
Now we have the prefix "11011010" and need to determine the next digit (the ninth digit). We will calculate the configurations starting with "11011010" and fixing the next digit as 0.

We need to count the configurations with the first nine digits as "110110100", leaving us with 4 digits to arrange 3 ones and 1 zero.

\[
C(4, 3) = \frac{4!}{3! \cdot 1!} = 4
\]

### Decision for the Ninth Digit:
Now we check:
- Since our target is 20 and \( C(4, 3) = 4 \), which is less than 20, we will fix the next digit as 1.

### Finalizing the Configuration:
Now we have fixed the first ten digits as "110110101". The remaining digit will consist of 2 ones and 0 zeros.

Thus, the complete binary representation of the 505th configuration is:
\[
1101101011
\]

### Convert to Decimal:
Now we convert this binary number to decimal:
\[
1 \times 2^{10} + 1 \times 2^{9} + 0 \times 2^{8} + 1 \times 2^{7} + 1 \times 2^{6} + 0 \times 2^{5} + 1 \times 2^{4} + 0 \times 2^{3} + 1 \times 2^{2} + 1 \times 2^{1} + 0 \times 2^{0}
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
1024 + 512 + 0 + 128 + 64 + 0 + 16 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 1280
\]

### Remainder When Divided by 1000:
Finally, we need to find the remainder when 1280 is divided by 1000:
\[
1280 \mod 1000 = 280
\]

So, the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000 is \( \boxed{280} \).
Teacher: You're very close! Let's clarify the choice for the eighth digit:

Currently, your prefix is "1101101" (7 digits) and you've already used 5 ones. That means you still need 3 ones in the remaining 6 positions, and your current target is 20.

Now, compare the two cases for the eighth digit:

1. If you choose 0 for the eighth digit, the prefix becomes "11011010."  
 • In that branch, you don't add a one (so still 5 ones in the prefix) and you'll need to place 3 ones in the remaining 5 positions.  
 • The number of configurations here is C(5, 3) = 10.  
 • These 10 configurations will cover positions 1 through 10 in this branch.

2. If you choose 1 for the eighth digit, the prefix becomes "11011011."  
 • Now you add a one (so you'll have 6 ones in the prefix) and you'll need 2 remaining ones in the remaining 5 positions.  
 • The number of configurations in this branch is C(5, 2) = 10.  
 • These 10 configurations will cover positions 11 through 20 of the branch.

Since your current target is 20, it falls into the second half (positions 11–20) of the total 20 configurations from these two branches. 

Therefore, you should choose the eighth digit as 1. Then update your target by subtracting the 10 configurations from the first branch:
  New target = 20 − 10 = 10.

So the updated prefix is "11011011" and your new target is 10.

That is your conclusion for the eighth digit.
Student: Now that we've established the prefix "11011011" and updated our target to 10, let's proceed to determine the ninth digit.

### Current Status:
1. **Current Prefix:** "11011011" (8 digits)
2. **Count of Ones So Far:** 6 (from the prefix)
3. **Remaining Positions:** 5 (since we have 13 total digits)
4. **Ones Needed:** 2 (since we need a total of 8 ones)
5. **Current Target:** 10

### Decision for the Ninth Digit:
Now we need to determine the ninth digit. We have two options:

1. **If the ninth digit is 0:** The prefix becomes "110110110". In this case, we still need to place 2 ones in the remaining 4 positions. The count of configurations in this case is:
   \[
   C(4, 2) = \frac{4!}{2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
   \]

2. **If the ninth digit is 1:** The prefix becomes "110110111". In this case, we would have 7 ones in the prefix and need to place 1 one in the remaining 4 positions. The count for this branch is:
   \[
   C(4, 1) = \frac{4!}{1! \cdot 3!} = \frac{4}{1} = 4
   \]

### Comparison with the Target:
Now we compare these counts with the current target of 10:
- **If the ninth digit is 0:** There are 6 configurations (from "110110110").
- **If the ninth digit is 1:** There are 4 configurations (from "110110111").

Since both counts (6 and 4) are less than the target of 10, we will fix the ninth digit as **0**.

### Update the Prefix and Target:
Now our updated prefix is:
\[
\text{Prefix: } 110110110
\]
The updated target remains **10** since we did not subtract anything from the target count.

### Next Steps:
Now we have the prefix "110110110" and need to determine the next digit (the tenth digit). We will calculate the configurations starting with "110110110" and fixing the next digit as 0.

We need to count the configurations with the first ten digits as "1101101100", leaving us with 3 digits to arrange 2 ones and 1 zero.

\[
C(3, 2) = \frac{3!}{2! \cdot 1!} = 3
\]

### Decision for the Tenth Digit:
Now we check:
- Since our target is 10 and \( C(3, 2) = 3 \), which is less than 10, we will fix the next digit as 1.

### Finalizing the Configuration:
Now we have fixed the first eleven digits as "1101101101". The remaining digit will consist of 1 one and 0 zeros, meaning the last digit must be 0.

Thus, the complete binary representation of the 505th configuration is:
\[
11011011010
\]

### Convert to Decimal:
Now we convert this binary number to decimal:
\[
1 \times 2^{10} + 1 \times 2^{9} + 0 \times 2^{8} + 1 \times 2^{7} + 1 \times 2^{6} + 0 \times 2^{5} + 1 \times 2^{4} + 1 \times 2^{3} + 0 \times 2^{2} + 1 \times 2^{1} + 0 \times 2^{0}
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
1024 + 512 + 0 + 128 + 64 + 0 + 16 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 1756
\]

### Remainder When Divided by 1000:
Finally, we need to find the remainder when 1756 is divided by 1000:
\[
1756 \mod 1000 = 756
\]

So, the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000 is \( \boxed{756} \).
Teacher: You're very close, but let's pause and double‐check the digit count. We expect a 13‑digit binary number (starting with 1), but your final string "11011011010" has only 11 digits. That suggests we haven’t yet determined the last two digits.

Let's quickly review our status before deciding the remaining digits:

• So far you fixed:
 – Prefix “11011011” (8 digits) with a target of 10.
 – Then you decided on the ninth digit. (Recall: after the eighth digit branch, you had “11011011” and 5 positions remaining, needing 2 ones.)

At that step you compared:
 • If ninth digit is 0, then prefix becomes “110110110” and the count is C(4,2) = 6.
 • If ninth digit is 1, then prefix becomes “110110111” and the count is C(4,1) = 4.
Together they yield 10 configurations.  
Since the target was 10, that means the 10th configuration in this two-branch sequence comes from the second branch (the “1‑branch”). 

Review carefully:
 – The branch with the ninth digit 0 covers positions 1–6.
 – The branch with the ninth digit 1 covers positions 7–10.
Since 10 > 6, the ninth digit should be 1 and you then update the target by subtracting 6 (so new target becomes 10 – 6 = 4). 

That would give the prefix “11011011 1” (9 digits now).  
Now with a 9‑digit prefix you have 13 – 9 = 4 digits remaining.  
At this point, the ones in the prefix:
 • “11011011 1” has: 1+1+0+1+1+0+1+1+1. Count the ones: that is 1 (first) +1 (second) +0 (third) +1 (fourth) +1 (fifth) +0 (sixth) +1 (seventh) +1 (eighth) +1 (ninth) = 7 ones.
So you still need 8 – 7 = 1 one in the remaining 4 positions.

Now you would decide the tenth digit in a similar way (comparing the case if it is 0 vs. 1 using the relevant binomial coefficients for filling 1 one among the remaining 3 digits if you choose 1, or 1 one among 4 positions if you choose 0).

Could you review this part carefully and update your decisions so that you end up with a 13‑digit binary number? Let’s work out the next decision (for the tenth digit) using the method we discussed:

• With the prefix “110110111” (9 digits), you have 4 positions left and need to place 1 one.
 – If the tenth digit is 0, then the branch gives you: you still need 1 one among the remaining 3 positions. The count here is C(3,1) = 3.
 – If the tenth digit is 1, then you add a one (making 8 ones in the prefix) and then you need 0 ones among the remaining 3 positions. The count for that branch is C(3,0) = 1.

Since the branch with 0 gives 3 configurations (covering positions 1 to 3 in that branch) and the branch with 1 gives 1 configuration (covering the fourth configuration), your target (which is 4 from the previous update) falls into the second branch.

Please confirm this reasoning and update the prefix and target accordingly for the tenth digit. What do you conclude for the tenth digit, and what will your updated prefix and target be?
