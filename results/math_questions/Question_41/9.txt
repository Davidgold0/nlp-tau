Question: Nancy generates a two-digit integer by rolling a six-sided die twice. The result of her first roll is the tens digit, and the result of her second roll is the ones digit. What is the probability that the resulting integer is divisible by 8? Express your answer as a common fraction.
3o-mini: The two-digit integer is formed by having the first roll determine the tens digit and the second roll determine the ones digit. Since both dice have 6 faces, there are 6 possibilities for each digit, and thus a total of 6 × 6 = 36 possible two-digit numbers.

Now, we need to count how many of these two-digit numbers are divisible by 8. The two-digit multiples of 8 are: 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, etc. However, we only consider those numbers where each digit is between 1 and 6. This eliminates numbers like 40 (because 0 is not available as a roll) and 48 (because 8 is not on the die).

The valid numbers divisible by 8 are:
• 16 (tens = 1, ones = 6)
• 24 (tens = 2, ones = 4)
• 32 (tens = 3, ones = 2)
• 56 (tens = 5, ones = 6)
• 64 (tens = 6, ones = 4)

There are 5 such numbers. Therefore, the probability is 5/36.

So, the answer is 5/36.
