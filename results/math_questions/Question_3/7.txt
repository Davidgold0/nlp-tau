Question: The owners of a house that is assessed at $\$120,\!000$ pay $\$3,\!000$ in taxes. At the same rate, what is the tax, in dollars, for a house assessed at $\$160,\!000$?
3o-mini: We start by finding the tax rate using the given information for the first house. The tax rate is determined by dividing the tax amount by the assessed value:

Tax rate = 3000 รท 120000 = 0.025

Now applying this same rate to a house assessed at 160000:

Tax = 0.025 ร 160000 = 4000

Thus, the tax for a house assessed at $160,000 is $4,000.
