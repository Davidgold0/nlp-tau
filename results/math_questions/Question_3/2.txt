Question: The owners of a house that is assessed at $\$120,\!000$ pay $\$3,\!000$ in taxes. At the same rate, what is the tax, in dollars, for a house assessed at $\$160,\!000$?
Teacher: Let's start by outlining the steps we need to take to solve this problem:

1. Determine the tax rate by dividing the tax paid for the first house by its assessed value.
2. Use the tax rate to calculate the tax for the house assessed at $160,000.

Let's begin with step 1. Can you compute the tax rate by dividing 3,000 by 120,000? What result do you get?
Student: Sure! To find the tax rate, I will divide the tax paid for the first house, which is \$3,000, by its assessed value of \$120,000.

So, the calculation is:

\[
\text{Tax Rate} = \frac{3,000}{120,000}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Tax Rate} = 0.025
\]

This means the tax rate is 0.025, or 2.5%. 

What should I do next?
Teacher: Great job calculating the tax rate as 0.025, or 2.5%! Now let's move to step 2.

Step 2: Use the tax rate to calculate the tax for the house assessed at $160,000. To do this, multiply the tax rate by $160,000.

What's your calculation for this step?
Student: Student: Alright! To calculate the tax for the house assessed at \$160,000, I will multiply the tax rate of 0.025 by the assessed value of \$160,000.

So the calculation is:

\[
\text{Tax} = 0.025 \times 160,000
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Tax} = 4,000
\]

Therefore, the tax for the house assessed at \$160,000 is \$4,000. 

Is that correct?
Teacher: Excellent work! You correctly calculated that the tax rate is 0.025 (or 2.5%), and then you multiplied it by 160,000 to find the tax for the second house. Just to recap our process:

1. We determined the tax rate by dividing 3,000 by 120,000 to get 0.025.
2. We applied this tax rate to the second house by multiplying 0.025 by 160,000 to get 4,000.

Your final answer of 4,000 is correct.
