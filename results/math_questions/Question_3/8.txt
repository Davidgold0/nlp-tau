Question: The owners of a house that is assessed at $\$120,\!000$ pay $\$3,\!000$ in taxes. At the same rate, what is the tax, in dollars, for a house assessed at $\$160,\!000$?
3o-mini: The tax rate is determined by dividing the tax paid by the assessed value. For the first house:

Tax rate = 3000 / 120000 = 0.025 (or 2.5%)

For the second house valued at 160,000 dollars, the tax is:

Tax = 160000 Ã— 0.025 = 4000

Thus, the tax for the \$160,000 house is \$4,000.
