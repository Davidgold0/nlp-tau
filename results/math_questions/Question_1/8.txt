Question: Because of redistricting, Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students. This is an increase of $4\%$ over last year's enrollment. What was last year's enrollment?
3o-mini: Let last year's enrollment be x. This year's enrollment is x plus a 4% increase, which can be written as:

  1.04 · x = 598

To solve for x, divide both sides by 1.04:

  x = 598 ÷ 1.04
  x = 575

So, last year's enrollment was 575 students.
