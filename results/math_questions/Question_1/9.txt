Question: Because of redistricting, Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students. This is an increase of $4\%$ over last year's enrollment. What was last year's enrollment?
3o-mini: Let last year’s enrollment be x. Since the enrollment increased by 4%, the new enrollment is 1.04 times last year’s enrollment. This gives us the equation:

  1.04 × x = 598

To solve for x, divide both sides of the equation by 1.04:

  x = 598 / 1.04

Calculating the division:

  x = 575

Therefore, last year's enrollment was 575 students.
