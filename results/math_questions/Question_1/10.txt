Question: Because of redistricting, Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students. This is an increase of $4\%$ over last year's enrollment. What was last year's enrollment?
3o-mini: Let last year's enrollment be E. Since this year's enrollment increased by 4%, we have:

  1.04E = 598

To find E, divide both sides by 1.04:

  E = 598 / 1.04 = 575

So, last year's enrollment was 575 students.
