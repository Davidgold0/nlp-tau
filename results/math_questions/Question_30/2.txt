Question: What is the sum of all the positive divisors of 91?
Teacher: Alright, let's start by outlining the plan to approach this problem:

1. First, we need to determine the prime factorization of 91.
2. Using the prime factors, we can list all the positive divisors of 91.
3. Finally, we'll add all those divisors together to get the sum.

Let's begin with the first step. Can you find and state the prime factorization of 91?
Student: To find the prime factorization of 91, I will start by checking for divisibility by the smallest prime numbers.

1. 91 is not even, so it is not divisible by 2.
2. The sum of the digits of 91 (9 + 1 = 10) is not divisible by 3, so 91 is not divisible by 3.
3. 91 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
4. Next, I will check 7: \( 91 \div 7 = 13 \), which means 91 is divisible by 7.

Since both 7 and 13 are prime numbers, the prime factorization of 91 is:

\[ 91 = 7 \times 13 \]

Is this correct?
Teacher: Excellent! Your prime factorization is correct: 91 = 7 × 13. 

Now, let's move to the next step. Using these prime factors, can you please list all the positive divisors of 91? Remember to include 1 and 91 itself.
Student: To list all the positive divisors of 91, I will use its prime factorization, which is \( 7 \times 13 \).

The positive divisors can be found by considering all combinations of the prime factors, including 1 and 91 itself. The divisors are:

1. \( 1 \) (the multiplicative identity)
2. \( 7 \) (the first prime factor)
3. \( 13 \) (the second prime factor)
4. \( 91 \) (the product of the prime factors, \( 7 \times 13 \))

So, the complete list of positive divisors of 91 is: \( 1, 7, 13, 91 \).

Is this correct?
Teacher: You're absolutely correct—the positive divisors of 91 are 1, 7, 13, and 91.

For the final step, please add these divisors together to find the sum. What do you get when you sum 1, 7, 13, and 91?
Student: To find the sum of the positive divisors of 91, I will add the numbers together:

1. Start with the first two divisors:
   \( 1 + 7 = 8 \)

2. Next, add the third divisor:
   \( 8 + 13 = 21 \)

3. Finally, add the last divisor:
   \( 21 + 91 = 112 \)

So, the sum of all the positive divisors of 91 is \( 112 \). Is that correct?
Teacher: Great work! You correctly added the divisors: 1 + 7 + 13 + 91 = 112. Your reasoning was clear, and each step was correctly executed. 

To summarize:
1. We factorized 91 as 7 × 13.
2. We listed the divisors: 1, 7, 13, and 91.
3. We then added the divisors to get 112.

Final answer: 112$
