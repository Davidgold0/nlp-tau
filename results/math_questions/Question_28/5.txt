Question: Find the minimum value of_x000D_
\[\frac{\left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^6 - \left( x^6 + \dfrac{1}{x^6} \right) - 2}{\left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^3 + \left( x^3 + \dfrac{1}{x^3} \right)}\]for $x > 0.$
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem into manageable steps. We have the expression

  [(x + 1/x)^6 – (x^6 + 1/x^6) – 2] ÷ [(x + 1/x)^3 + (x^3 + 1/x^3)]

for x > 0, and we need to find its minimum value.

A good approach here is to notice the symmetry in the expression and introduce a substitution. One common substitution for problems like this is:

  t = x + 1/x

This substitution is very useful because for x > 0, we have t ≥ 2 by the AM–GM inequality. Additionally, there are known identities that allow you to express terms like x^3 + 1/x^3 and x^6 + 1/x^6 in terms of t.

Here’s an outline of the steps we will follow:

1. Substitute t = x + 1/x.  
2. Express (x + 1/x)^3 and x^3 + 1/x^3 in terms of t using known identities.  
3. Express x^6 + 1/x^6 in terms of t, likely by squaring the expression for x^3 + 1/x^3 and adjusting appropriately.  
4. Substitute these expressions back into the original expression, simplify, and then analyze the new expression in terms of t (keeping in mind that t ≥ 2).  
5. Determine the minimum value of the simplified expression.

Let’s begin with the first step. Using the substitution t = x + 1/x, please express (x + 1/x)^3 and x^3 + 1/x^3 in terms of t. What formulas or identities do you know that could help with this?
Student: Sure! To express \((x + \frac{1}{x})^3\) and \(x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3}\) in terms of \(t\), we can use the following identities:

1. The identity for the cube of a sum:
   \[
   (a + b)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + 3ab(a + b)
   \]
   In our case, let \(a = x\) and \(b = \frac{1}{x}\). Then we have:
   \[
   (x + \frac{1}{x})^3 = x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} + 3\left(x \cdot \frac{1}{x}\right)\left(x + \frac{1}{x}\right) = x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} + 3(x + \frac{1}{x})
   \]

2. Rearranging gives us:
   \[
   x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} = (x + \frac{1}{x})^3 - 3(x + \frac{1}{x}) = t^3 - 3t
   \]
   where \(t = x + \frac{1}{x}\).

Now, for \(x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6}\), we can use the identity:
\[
x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6} = (x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3})^2 - 2
\]
Using our previous result:
\[
x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6} = (t^3 - 3t)^2 - 2
\]

Now we have:
- \((x + \frac{1}{x})^3 = t^3\)
- \(x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} = t^3 - 3t\)
- \(x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6} = (t^3 - 3t)^2 - 2\)

Now, we can substitute these expressions back into the original expression. Would you like me to proceed with that substitution?
Teacher: You're on the right track! I can see you've correctly identified and expressed the needed identities:

  • (x + 1/x)³ = t³  
  • x³ + 1/x³ = t³ – 3t  
  • x⁶ + 1/x⁶ = (t³ – 3t)² – 2

Now, our next step is to substitute these expressions into our original expression:

  [(x + 1/x)⁶ – (x⁶ + 1/x⁶) – 2] ÷ [(x + 1/x)³ + (x³ + 1/x³)]

Remember that (x + 1/x)⁶ = (t)⁶ = t⁶, and we already have an expression for x⁶ + 1/x⁶.

So, after the substitution, the numerator becomes:
  t⁶ – {[(t³ – 3t)² – 2]} – 2

and the denominator becomes:
  t³ + (t³ – 3t)

Please perform this substitution and simplify both the numerator and the denominator as much as possible. What expressions do you get for them? (Take it one step at a time.)
Student: Sure! Let's substitute the expressions we have into the original expression and simplify.

### Substituting into the Numerator:
The numerator is:
\[
t^6 - \left[(t^3 - 3t)^2 - 2\right] - 2
\]

First, let's simplify \((t^3 - 3t)^2\):
\[
(t^3 - 3t)^2 = t^6 - 6t^4 + 9t^2
\]

Now substituting this back into the numerator:
\[
t^6 - \left[t^6 - 6t^4 + 9t^2 - 2\right] - 2
\]

Distributing the negative sign:
\[
t^6 - t^6 + 6t^4 - 9t^2 + 2 - 2
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
6t^4 - 9t^2
\]

### Substituting into the Denominator:
The denominator is:
\[
t^3 + (t^3 - 3t)
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
t^3 + t^3 - 3t = 2t^3 - 3t
\]

### Final Expression:
Now we can put together the simplified numerator and denominator:
\[
\frac{6t^4 - 9t^2}{2t^3 - 3t}
\]

### Further Simplification:
We can factor out common terms in the numerator:
\[
6t^4 - 9t^2 = 3t^2(2t^2 - 3)
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{3t^2(2t^2 - 3)}{2t^3 - 3t}
\]

Factoring the denominator:
\[
2t^3 - 3t = t(2t^2 - 3)
\]

Thus, we can simplify the entire expression:
\[
\frac{3t^2(2t^2 - 3)}{t(2t^2 - 3)}
\]

As long as \(t \neq 0\) and \(2t^2 - 3 \neq 0\), we can cancel \(2t^2 - 3\) from the numerator and denominator:
\[
\frac{3t^2}{t} = 3t \quad \text{for } t > \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \text{ (since } t \geq 2\text{)}
\]

### Conclusion:
Now, we have the expression simplified to:
\[
3t
\]

To find the minimum value for \(t \geq 2\):
\[
3t \text{ is minimized when } t = 2.
\]
Thus, the minimum value is:
\[
3 \times 2 = 6.
\]

So, the minimum value of the original expression is **6**. Would you like to go over any part of this process again, or is there anything else you would like to discuss?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly substituted and simplified the expression step by step. To recap:

• You replaced (x + 1/x) with t, and correctly noted that t³ = (x + 1/x)³  
• You expressed x³ + 1/x³ as t³ – 3t  
• You derived x⁶ + 1/x⁶ as (t³ – 3t)² – 2  
• Then you substituted these into the numerator and denominator, simplifying them down to (3t²(2t² – 3))/(t(2t² – 3)), which neatly simplifies to 3t  
• Finally, remembering that t = x + 1/x and that for x > 0 we have t ≥ 2, you correctly concluded that 3t is minimized when t = 2, yielding 3 × 2 = 6

What you have done is spot on. If everything is clear up to this point, then the final minimum value of the original expression is

6$
