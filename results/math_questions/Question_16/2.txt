Question: The first term of a geometric sequence is 729, and the 7th term is 64. What is the positive, real value for the 5th term?
Teacher: Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: We know the first term (a₁) is 729 and the seventh term (a₇) is 64. For a geometric sequence, the nth term is given by aₙ = a₁ · rⁿ⁻¹. This means for the 7th term we have:

  729 · r⁶ = 64.

Please solve this equation for r (i.e., isolate r). What do you get for r?
Student: To solve for \( r \) in the equation \( 729 \cdot r^6 = 64 \), I will first isolate \( r^6 \).

1. Divide both sides by 729:
   \[
   r^6 = \frac{64}{729}
   \]

2. Now, I need to simplify \( \frac{64}{729} \). I know that \( 64 = 2^6 \) and \( 729 = 3^6 \), so:
   \[
   r^6 = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^6
   \]

3. To find \( r \), I take the sixth root of both sides:
   \[
   r = \frac{2}{3}
   \]

So, the value of \( r \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \). Is that correct?
Teacher: Excellent work solving for r! Your solution that r = 2/3 is correct.

Now, let's move on to the next step. We need to find the fifth term (a₅) of the geometric sequence. Recall the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence:

  aₙ = a₁ × rⁿ⁻¹

Since a₁ = 729 and you have found r = 2/3, write the expression for a₅ using this formula. What is your expression for a₅? Please show your work for how you set up this calculation.
Student: To find the fifth term \( a_5 \) of the geometric sequence, I will use the formula for the nth term:

\[
a_n = a_1 \times r^{n-1}
\]

Given that \( a_1 = 729 \) and \( r = \frac{2}{3} \), I can substitute these values into the formula for \( n = 5 \):

\[
a_5 = 729 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{5-1}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
a_5 = 729 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^4
\]

Now, I will calculate \( \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^4 \):

\[
\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^4 = \frac{2^4}{3^4} = \frac{16}{81}
\]

Next, I will substitute this back into the equation for \( a_5 \):

\[
a_5 = 729 \times \frac{16}{81}
\]

To simplify this, I can divide \( 729 \) by \( 81 \):

\[
729 \div 81 = 9
\]

So, now I have:

\[
a_5 = 9 \times 16 = 144
\]

Thus, the positive, real value for the 5th term \( a_5 \) is \( 144 \). Is that correct?
Teacher: Great job on your work so far! Your process for finding a₅ was perfectly set up and your calculations are spot on. It looks like you correctly substituted into a₅ = 729 · (2/3)^(5−1), simplified (2/3)^4 to 16/81, and then computed 729 × (16/81) to get 144.

Since you’ve reached your final answer, I'll now state it as required:
144$
