Question: The first term of a geometric sequence is 729, and the 7th term is 64. What is the positive, real value for the 5th term?
Teacher: Let's break down the problem first. We have a geometric sequence where the first term is 729 and the 7th term is 64. The general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is:

  aₙ = a₁ · r^(n - 1)

With this in mind, here’s an outline of our steps:

1. Write an equation using the 7th term based on the formula.
2. Use that equation to solve for the common ratio r.
3. Once you have r, write the equation for the 5th term using the same formula.
4. Substitute the known values and compute the 5th term.

Now, let’s start with the first step. Please write the equation that represents the 7th term (a₇) using the formula and the given values. What expression do you get?
Student: Sure! Following the teacher's guidance, I will write the equation for the 7th term using the formula for a geometric sequence.

The formula for the nth term is:

\[ a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{(n - 1)} \]

Given that the first term \( a_1 = 729 \) and the 7th term \( a_7 = 64 \), we can substitute these values into the formula for the 7th term:

\[ a_7 = a_1 \cdot r^{(7 - 1)} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 64 = 729 \cdot r^6 \]

So, the equation representing the 7th term is:

\[ 64 = 729 \cdot r^6 \]

Is that correct?
Teacher: That's exactly right! You've correctly set up the equation:

  64 = 729 · r⁶

Now, let's move on to the next step. Please isolate r by solving for r⁶ first and then determining r. What do you get when you solve for the common ratio r?
Student: Student: Thank you for the confirmation! Now, let's isolate \( r \) in the equation \( 64 = 729 \cdot r^6 \).

First, I will divide both sides of the equation by 729 to solve for \( r^6 \):

\[
r^6 = \frac{64}{729}
\]

Next, I can simplify \( \frac{64}{729} \). We know that \( 64 = 2^6 \) and \( 729 = 3^6 \), so:

\[
r^6 = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^6
\]

Now, to find \( r \), I will take the sixth root of both sides:

\[
r = \frac{2}{3}
\]

So, the common ratio \( r \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \). Is that correct?
Teacher: Great job finding the common ratio! Now, let's move on to the next step.

We need to calculate the 5th term of the sequence. Remember, the formula for the nth term in a geometric sequence is:

  aₙ = a₁ · r^(n – 1)

Since we're interested in the 5th term (a₅), the equation becomes:

  a₅ = 729 · r^(5 – 1) = 729 · r⁴

Now that we have r = 2/3, please substitute it into the equation and compute a₅. What value do you get for the 5th term?
Student: Thank you for your guidance! Now, let's calculate the 5th term \( a_5 \) using the formula:

\[
a_5 = a_1 \cdot r^{(5 - 1)} = 729 \cdot r^4
\]

We already found that \( r = \frac{2}{3} \). Now, substituting \( r \) into the equation:

\[
a_5 = 729 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^4
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^4 \):

\[
\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^4 = \frac{2^4}{3^4} = \frac{16}{81}
\]

Now substituting this back into the equation for \( a_5 \):

\[
a_5 = 729 \cdot \frac{16}{81}
\]

Next, we can simplify \( 729 \div 81 \):

\[
729 \div 81 = 9
\]

So we have:

\[
a_5 = 9 \cdot 16 = 144
\]

Thus, the positive, real value for the 5th term \( a_5 \) is \( 144 \). Is that correct?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly derived that a₅ = 729 × (2/3)⁴ = 729 × (16/81) = 144. 

To summarize our process:
1. We set up the equation from the 7th term: 64 = 729 · r⁶.
2. We solved for r and found r = 2/3.
3. Then, we calculated the 5th term using a₅ = 729 · (r)⁴, which gave us 144.

Congratulations on reaching the final answer: 144$
