Question: The first term of a geometric sequence is 729, and the 7th term is 64. What is the positive, real value for the 5th term?
Teacher: Let's break down the problem into smaller steps. We have a geometric sequence where the first term is 729 and the 7th term is 64. In a geometric sequence, the nth term is given by:

  nth term = (first term) × (r)^(n – 1)

For the 7th term, the formula becomes:
  729 × (r)^(6) = 64

Step 1: Set up the equation to solve for r. Can you tell me what the equation for r is, and how you would simplify it before finding r? Please work on this step and share your reasoning.
Student: To find the common ratio \( r \) in the geometric sequence, we start with the equation for the 7th term:

\[
729 \times (r)^{6} = 64
\]

To isolate \( (r)^{6} \), we first divide both sides of the equation by 729:

\[
(r)^{6} = \frac{64}{729}
\]

Next, we can simplify \( \frac{64}{729} \). We know that \( 64 \) can be expressed as \( 2^{6} \) and \( 729 \) can be expressed as \( 3^{6} \). So we rewrite the fraction:

\[
(r)^{6} = \frac{2^{6}}{3^{6}} = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{6}
\]

Now, we can take the sixth root of both sides to solve for \( r \):

\[
r = \frac{2}{3}
\]

So, the common ratio \( r \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \). Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Great job on solving step 1! Your work in isolating r and showing that (r)⁶ = (2/3)⁶ is clear and correct.

Now, let’s move on to the next step. Remember, the nth term of a geometric sequence is given by:

  nth term = (first term) × (r)^(n – 1)

For the 5th term, we have n = 5. That means the 5th term = 729 × (r)^(4).

Since you found r = 2/3, please calculate (2/3)⁴ and then multiply it by 729 to determine the positive, real value of the 5th term.

Please show your work for calculating (2/3)⁴ and then multiplying by 729. What do you get for the 5th term?
Student: To find the 5th term of the geometric sequence, we will use the formula for the nth term, which is:

\[
\text{5th term} = 729 \times (r)^{4}
\]

We already found that \( r = \frac{2}{3} \). Now we need to calculate \( (r)^{4} \):

\[
(r)^{4} = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{4} = \frac{2^{4}}{3^{4}} = \frac{16}{81}
\]

Now, we can substitute this back into the equation for the 5th term:

\[
\text{5th term} = 729 \times \frac{16}{81}
\]

Next, we simplify \( 729 \div 81 \):

\[
729 \div 81 = 9
\]

Now we can multiply by 16:

\[
\text{5th term} = 9 \times 16 = 144
\]

So, the positive, real value for the 5th term is:

\[
\boxed{144}
\] 

Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Great work on calculating (2/3)⁴ as 16/81 and then multiplying 729 by 16/81 to get 144! Your reasoning and calculations were correct, and you’ve applied the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence accurately.

To summarize:
1. We set up the equation 729 · r⁶ = 64 and isolated r⁶ = (64/729) = (2/3)⁶.
2. Taking the sixth root gave us r = 2/3.
3. For the 5th term, we used the formula: 729 · r⁴ = 729 · (2/3)⁴.
4. You correctly computed (2/3)⁴ = 16/81 and then simplified 729 ÷ 81 = 9, finally arriving at 9 · 16 = 144.

Your final answer is: 144$
