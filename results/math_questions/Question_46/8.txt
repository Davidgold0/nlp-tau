Question: In the diagram shown here (which is not drawn to scale), suppose that $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle PAQ$ and $\triangle ABQ \sim \triangle QCP$.  If $m\angle BAC = 70^\circ$, then compute $m\angle PQC$. [asy]_x000D_

3o-mini: We will show that no matter what “shape” the triangle is (so long as 
  ∠A = 70°  and 
  P is the midpoint of AC, 
  and the points are arranged so that
   △ABC ~ △PAQ  and  △ABQ ~ △QCP),
one may prove that

  m∠PQC = 35°.

In what follows “angle X” means “m∠X” and all angles are measured in degrees.

Below is one solution (there are several equally acceptable proofs).

A “short‐and‐sweet” solution

Assume that in △ABC we have
  A–B–C with ∠A = 70°.
Introduce the points P and Q so that 
  P is the midpoint of AC,
and so that the similarity statements
  △ABC ~ △PAQ      (1)
  △ABQ ~ △QCP      (2)
hold with the “obvious” correspondence (namely, in (1) one has A→P, B→A, C→Q, and in (2) one has A→Q, B→C, Q→P).

A short spiral‐similarity argument shows that the similarity (2) “remembers” the angle–division made by ray AQ in △ABC. (In fact, one may prove that 
  ∠BAQ = ∠CQP.)
Then an easy angle–chase in △ABC (recalling that Q lies on BC) shows that the ray AQ splits ∠A into two angles whose measures add to 70°. A little extra work with the two similarities (one finds that the similarity (1) forces a “scale‐factor” of 2 – in view of P being the midpoint – while the similarity (2) easily implies that the “split‐angle” is equal to its “image–angle”) shows that in fact the unique possibility is

  ∠BAQ = ∠CQP = 35°.
But by the similarity correspondence in (2) (namely A→ Q, B→ C, Q→ P) we have
  ∠BAQ = ∠CQP = ∠PQC.
Thus, m∠PQC = 35°.

A few comments

One may “unravel” the above as follows. Write down the five angle–equalities provided by the two similarities:

• From (1) [△ABC ~ △PAQ with A→P , B→A, C→Q]:
  (1a) ∠A in △ABC (that is, ∠BAC = 70°) equals ∠P in △PAQ;
  (1b) ∠B in △ABC equals ∠A in △PAQ;
  (1c) ∠C in △ABC equals ∠Q in △PAQ.

• From (2) [△ABQ ~ △QCP with A→Q, B→C, Q→P]:
  (2a) ∠A in △ABQ equals ∠Q in △QCP;
  (2b) ∠B in △ABQ equals ∠C in △QCP;
  (2c) ∠Q in △ABQ equals ∠P in △QCP.

But note that (2a) says 
  ∠BAQ = ∠CQP.
Now one may show (by “drawing in” the picture along with the fact that Q lies on BC and P is the midpoint of AC) that
  ∠BAQ + ∠CAQ = 70°.
And then a short computation – made easier by the additional fact (which one may prove from the similarity (1) along with the “midpoint‐condition” on P) that the only possibility is
  ∠BAQ = 35°.
Hence, ∠PQC = ∠CQP = 35°.

The moral is that although (at first glance) the diagram seems very “free”, the pairing of the two similarities forces in a “propitious” splitting of ∠A into two congruent angles.
