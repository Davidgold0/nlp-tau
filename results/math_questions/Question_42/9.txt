\[\tan \frac{\alpha}{2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{2}}.\]Let $\theta$ be the angle between the median and the angle bisector drawn from this acute angle.  Find $\tan \theta.$
3o-mini: We begin by considering a right triangle in which one of the acute angles at vertex A has measure α. (In our triangle the right angle will be taken at vertex C.) We will construct two segments from vertex A: the median to side BC and the interior angle bisector of angle A. We are given

  tan(α/2) = 1/∛2        (1)

and we wish to find tan θ, where θ is the angle between the median and the angle bisector from A.

Step 1. Setting Up a Coordinate System

Place vertex A at the origin (0, 0), and let side AC lie along the positive x-axis. Let point C lie on the x-axis and point B be positioned so that line AB makes an angle α with the x-axis. Thus we may choose:
  A = (0, 0)
  C = (b, 0)
  B = (c cos α, c sin α)
Here c = AB and b = AC.

Since the triangle is right-angled at C, we require that angle C = 90°. (The right angle condition can be enforced by an appropriate relation among the sides.) At vertex C the vectors are
  CA = A – C = (–b, 0)
  CB = B – C = (c cos α – b, c sin α)
For these vectors to be perpendicular their dot product must vanish:
  (–b)(c cos α – b) + (0)(c sin α) = 0 ⟹ –b c cos α + b² = 0.
Assuming b ≠ 0, we obtain
  b = c cos α.
Thus we will work with the relation b = c cos α.

Step 2. Locating the Median and the Angle Bisector

(a) The median from A is the line joining A to the midpoint M of side BC. We first find the coordinates of B and C. We already have:
  B = (c cos α, c sin α)
  C = (c cos α, 0)            [since b = c cos α]
The midpoint M of segment BC is given by:
  M = ((c cos α + c cos α)/2, (c sin α + 0)/2)
    = (c cos α, (c sin α)/2).
Thus, the median is the line from A = (0, 0) to M = (c cos α, (c sin α)/2). Its slope is
  mₘ = [(c sin α)/2] / [c cos α] = (sin α)/(2 cos α) = (1/2) tan α.

(b) The angle bisector from A divides angle A into two equal parts. Since one side of angle A is along the x-axis and the other makes an angle α with the x-axis, the bisector has direction at an angle of
  α/2 
with the x-axis. Therefore, its slope is
  m_b = tan(α/2).

Step 3. Finding the Angle Between the Median and the Angle Bisector

Let θ be the angle between the median (slope mₘ) and the bisector (slope m_b). The tangent of the angle between two lines with slopes m₁ and m₂ is given by
  tan θ = |(m₁ – m₂) / (1 + m₁ m₂)|.
Here, taking m₁ = tan(α/2) and m₂ = (tan α)/2, we get:
  tan θ = |tan(α/2) – (tan α)/2| / [1 + tan(α/2) · (tan α)/2].      (2)

To simplify (2), introduce t = tan(α/2). Also, recall the double-angle formula for tangent:
  tan α = 2t/(1 – t²).
Then,
  (tan α)/2 = t/(1 – t²).

Substitute these into (2):
  tan θ = |t – t/(1 – t²)| / [1 + t·(t/(1 – t²))]
      = |t[1 – 1/(1 – t²)]| / [1 + t²/(1 – t²)].

Now simplify the numerator:
  1 – 1/(1 – t²) = ( (1 – t²) – 1 )/(1 – t²) = (–t²)/(1 – t²).
Thus, numerator becomes:
  |t · (–t²/(1 – t²))| = t³/(1 – t²)
(since absolute value removes the minus sign).

Simplify the denominator:
  1 + t²/(1 – t²) = ( (1 – t²) + t² )/(1 – t²) = 1/(1 – t²).

Thus,
  tan θ = [t³/(1 – t²)] / [1/(1 – t²)] = t³.

Therefore,
  tan θ = (tan(α/2))³.          (3)

Step 4. Substitute the Given Value

We are given in (1) that:
  tan(α/2) = 1/∛2 = 1/(2^(1/3)).
Hence, using (3),
  tan θ = (1/(2^(1/3)))³ = 1/(2^(1/3·3)) = 1/2.

Thus, the answer is 1/2.
