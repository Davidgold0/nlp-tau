Question: In triangle $ABC$, $\tan \angle CAB = \frac{22}{7}$, and the altitude from $A$ divides $\overline{BC}$ into segments of length $3$ and $17$. What is the area of triangle $ABC$?
Teacher: Let's start by breaking the problem into clear steps. First, let’s visualize the situation:

• Draw triangle ABC. Let A be the vertex from which the altitude falls to side BC. Let the foot of the altitude be H on BC. We know that H splits BC into two segments, one of length 3 and the other of length 17 (so BC = 20).

• Let the altitude from A (that is, AH) have length h. Notice that AH is perpendicular to BC.

• Now, since tan ∠CAB = 22/7, and ∠CAB is at vertex A, we can think of this angle as being split by the altitude into two angles. If we let the two angles be α (angle BAH) and β (angle CAH), then clearly α + β = ∠CAB.

• In right triangle ABH, tanα = h/3 (because the opposite side is h and the adjacent side is 3).  
  In right triangle ACH, tanβ = h/17.

• Using the tangent addition formula for α + β we get:
  tan(α + β) = (tanα + tanβ)/(1 – tanα tanβ)

Substitute the expressions for tanα and tanβ:
  tan A = (h/3 + h/17) / [1 – (h/3)(h/17)].

Now we equate that to the given tan A = 22/7.

Here are the steps you might take:
1. Compute the numerator h/3 + h/17 by finding a common denominator.
2. Compute the product (h/3)(h/17) and use it in the denominator.
3. Set up the equation (h/3 + h/17) / [1 – (h^2)/(51)] = 22/7.
4. Solve the equation for h.
5. Finally, find the area of triangle ABC using the formula Area = (1/2) × (base) × (h), where the base BC = 20.

Let’s begin with the first step:

Can you show me how you would combine h/3 and h/17 into a single fraction?
Student: Sure! To combine \( \frac{h}{3} \) and \( \frac{h}{17} \) into a single fraction, we need to find a common denominator.

The denominators are 3 and 17. The least common multiple of 3 and 17 is \( 51 \).

Now we can rewrite each fraction with the common denominator of 51:

1. For \( \frac{h}{3} \):
   \[
   \frac{h}{3} = \frac{h \cdot 17}{3 \cdot 17} = \frac{17h}{51}
   \]

2. For \( \frac{h}{17} \):
   \[
   \frac{h}{17} = \frac{h \cdot 3}{17 \cdot 3} = \frac{3h}{51}
   \]

Now we can add these two fractions together:
\[
\frac{h}{3} + \frac{h}{17} = \frac{17h}{51} + \frac{3h}{51} = \frac{(17h + 3h)}{51} = \frac{20h}{51}
\]

So, \( \frac{h}{3} + \frac{h}{17} = \frac{20h}{51} \).

What should I do next?
Teacher: Great work! You've correctly combined the fractions into 20h/51.

Now, let's move to the next step: finding the product (h/3)(h/17). Can you work out that multiplication step-by-step?
Student: Sure! To find the product \( \left(\frac{h}{3}\right)\left(\frac{h}{17}\right) \), we can multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.

1. The numerator is \( h \cdot h = h^2 \).
2. The denominator is \( 3 \cdot 17 = 51 \).

So, we have:
\[
\left(\frac{h}{3}\right)\left(\frac{h}{17}\right) = \frac{h^2}{51}.
\]

What should I do next?
Teacher: Great job so far! Now that you’ve combined the fractions and computed the product, the next step is to set up the equation using the tangent addition formula. Recall that we have

  tan A = (tanα + tanβ) / [1 – (tanα)(tanβ)]  
      = (h/3 + h/17) / [1 – (h^2/51)]  
      = (20h/51) / [1 – (h^2/51)]

and we are given that tan A = 22/7.

So the equation becomes:

  (20h/51) / [1 – (h^2/51)] = 22/7

Now, can you show me how you would set up (and simplify if possible) this equation and then cross-multiply to prepare for solving for h? Let's work through this step.
Student: Student: Sure! We start with the equation:

\[
\frac{20h/51}{1 - (h^2/51)} = \frac{22}{7}.
\]

To simplify this, we can cross-multiply:

\[
20h \cdot 7 = 22 \cdot 51 \cdot (1 - (h^2/51)).
\]

Now let's simplify both sides.

On the left side, we have:

\[
140h.
\]

On the right side, we distribute \(22 \cdot 51\) and rewrite it:

\[
22 \cdot 51 = 1122,
\]
so we have:

\[
1122 \cdot (1 - \frac{h^2}{51}) = 1122 - \frac{1122h^2}{51}.
\]

Now we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
140h = 1122 - \frac{1122h^2}{51}.
\]

Next, to eliminate the fraction, we can multiply the entire equation by 51:

\[
51 \cdot 140h = 51 \cdot 1122 - 1122h^2.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
7140h = 57222 - 1122h^2.
\]

Now, let's rearrange the equation to bring everything to one side:

\[
1122h^2 + 7140h - 57222 = 0.
\]

What should I do next?
Teacher: Good job setting up the quadratic! Now we have the equation

  1122h² + 7140h – 57222 = 0.

Before solving for h, it’s a good idea to simplify this equation by dividing by a common factor if possible. Can you identify a common factor and simplify the quadratic further? Take your time and show your work for this step only.
Student: Sure! Let's take a look at the coefficients of the quadratic equation:

\[
1122h^2 + 7140h - 57222 = 0.
\]

To simplify, we can find a common factor for the coefficients. The coefficients are 1122, 7140, and -57222.

Let's check if these numbers share a common factor. 

1. **Finding the GCD**:
   - The GCD of 1122 and 7140 can be calculated by factoring both numbers:
     - \(1122 = 2 \times 3 \times 11 \times 17\)
     - \(7140 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 17\)

   The common factors are \(2\), \(3\), and \(17\). Hence, the GCD is \(2 \times 3 \times 17 = 102\).

2. **Checking -57222**:
   - Now, we check if 102 is also a factor of -57222:
     - Dividing \(57222\) by \(102\):
     \[
     -57222 \div 102 = -561.
     \]
   So, 102 is indeed a common factor.

Now, we can divide the entire equation by 102:

\[
\frac{1122h^2}{102} + \frac{7140h}{102} - \frac{57222}{102} = 0.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
11h^2 + 70h - 561 = 0.
\]

Now we have the simplified quadratic equation:

\[
11h^2 + 70h - 561 = 0.
\]

What should I do next?
Teacher: You've successfully simplified the quadratic to 11h² + 70h – 561 = 0. Great work so far!

Now, the next step is to solve this simplified quadratic equation for h. What method would you like to use here, and could you show me how you'd set up that step? (For example, do you want to try factoring, or would you prefer using the quadratic formula?)
Student: Student: Thank you! Since the coefficients in the quadratic equation \(11h^2 + 70h - 561 = 0\) don't seem to lend themselves easily to factoring, I think it would be best to use the quadratic formula. 

The quadratic formula is given by:

\[
h = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
\]

where \(a = 11\), \(b = 70\), and \(c = -561\).

Now, let's plug in these values into the formula:

1. **Calculate the discriminant** (\(b^2 - 4ac\)):
   \[
   b^2 = 70^2 = 4900,
   \]
   \[
   4ac = 4 \cdot 11 \cdot (-561) = -24684.
   \]
   So,
   \[
   b^2 - 4ac = 4900 + 24684 = 29584.
   \]

2. **Now apply the quadratic formula**:
   \[
   h = \frac{-70 \pm \sqrt{29584}}{2 \cdot 11}.
   \]

3. **Calculate \(\sqrt{29584}\)**:
   \[
   \sqrt{29584} = 172.0 \quad (\text{since } 172^2 = 29584).
   \]

4. **Substituting back into the formula**:
   \[
   h = \frac{-70 \pm 172}{22}.
   \]

This gives us two possible solutions for \(h\):

1. **Using the positive root**:
   \[
   h = \frac{-70 + 172}{22} = \frac{102}{22} = \frac{51}{11}.
   \]

2. **Using the negative root**:
   \[
   h = \frac{-70 - 172}{22} = \frac{-242}{22} = -11.
   \]
   Since \(h\) represents a length, we discard the negative value.

Thus, we find:
\[
h = \frac{51}{11}.
\]

What should I do next?
Teacher: Excellent work solving for h! Now we have h = 51/11.

The next step is to compute the area of triangle ABC using the formula:

  Area = (1/2) × (base) × (h).

We know the base BC = 20. Could you now calculate the area using these values? Please show your work.
Student: Sure! To find the area of triangle ABC, we will use the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times h.
\]

We have:
- Base \( BC = 20 \)
- Height \( h = \frac{51}{11} \)

Now, substituting these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 \times \frac{51}{11}.
\]

First, we calculate \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 \):

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10.
\]

Now, we multiply this by \( \frac{51}{11} \):

\[
\text{Area} = 10 \times \frac{51}{11} = \frac{510}{11}.
\]

Thus, the area of triangle ABC is:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{510}{11}.
\]

If you want, I can also convert this to a decimal or mixed number. Would you like that?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've successfully computed the area of triangle ABC.

To summarize our process:
1. We set up the problem by noting that the tangent of the angle at A can be expressed using the two right triangles formed by the altitude.
2. We combined the expressions for tanα and tanβ to get (20h/51) and found the product (h²/51).
3. Then we set up the equation using the tangent addition formula: (20h/51) / [1 – (h²/51)] = 22/7, and cross-multiplied.
4. We simplified the resulting quadratic to 11h² + 70h – 561 = 0 and solved it using the quadratic formula, discarding the negative root to obtain h = 51/11.
5. Finally, we computed the area using Area = (1/2) × base × h, with base = 20, which yielded an area of 510/11.

Your final answer for the area is:
510/11$
