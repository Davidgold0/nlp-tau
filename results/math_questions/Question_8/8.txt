Question: In triangle $ABC$, $\tan \angle CAB = \frac{22}{7}$, and the altitude from $A$ divides $\overline{BC}$ into segments of length $3$ and $17$. What is the area of triangle $ABC$?
3o-mini: We are given a triangle ABC in which the altitude from vertex A meets side BC at D. The altitude divides BC into two segments (BD and DC) with lengths 3 and 17 (the order does not affect the final answer). Also, we know that

  tan(∠CAB) = 22/7.

One effective method is to place the triangle on the coordinate plane as follows.

Step 1. Place D, the foot of the altitude from A, at the origin, D = (0, 0).  
Since BC is divided into segments of lengths 3 and 17, we can let BC lie along the x-axis. For example, set one configuration as:  
  B = (–3, 0)  and  C = (17, 0).

Step 2. Since AD is perpendicular to BC (which is horizontal), the altitude is vertical. So we place A directly above (or below) D. Choose A = (0, h) with h > 0.

Step 3. Now compute the vectors from A to B and from A to C:
  AB = B – A = (–3 – 0, 0 – h) = (–3, –h),  
  AC = C – A = (17 – 0, 0 – h) = (17, –h).

Step 4. The measure of angle CAB is the angle between vectors AB and AC. We can express tan of the angle between two vectors u and v by the formula:
  tan(θ) = (|u × v|) / (u · v).

Calculate the cross product (in 2D, the magnitude of the “cross product” is the absolute value of the determinant):
  |AB × AC| = |det([–3, –h], [17, –h])|  
        = |(–3)(–h) – (17)(–h)|  
        = |3h + 17h| = 20h.

Calculate the dot product:
  AB · AC = (–3)(17) + (–h)(–h) = –51 + h².

Thus,
  tan(∠CAB) = 20h/(h² – 51).

We are given that tan(∠CAB) = 22/7, so we set:
  20h/(h² – 51) = 22/7.

Step 5. Solve for h:
  Multiply both sides by (h² – 51) and 7:
    7(20h) = 22(h² – 51)
    140h = 22h² – 1122.
Rearrange:
  22h² – 140h – 1122 = 0.
Divide the entire equation by 2:
  11h² – 70h – 561 = 0.
Use the quadratic formula:
  h = [70 ± √(70² + 4·11·561)]/(2·11).

Compute the discriminant:
  70² = 4900,  4·11·561 = 24684,  thus:
  Discriminant = 4900 + 24684 = 29584.
Notice that 29584 factors as 16 × 1849, and since 1849 = 43², we have:
  √29584 = 4·43 = 172.

So,
  h = (70 ± 172) / 22.
Since h > 0, choose the positive solution:
  h = (70 + 172)/22 = 242/22 = 11.

Step 6. Finally, find the area of triangle ABC.
The base BC has length 3 + 17 = 20. The altitude from A is h = 11. Therefore,
  Area = ½ × base × height = ½ × 20 × 11 = 110.

Thus, the area of triangle ABC is 110.
