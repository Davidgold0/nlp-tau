Question: In triangle $ABC$, $\tan \angle CAB = \frac{22}{7}$, and the altitude from $A$ divides $\overline{BC}$ into segments of length $3$ and $17$. What is the area of triangle $ABC$?
3o-mini: We are given a triangle ABC in which the altitude from A to side BC divides BC into two segments of lengths 3 and 17, and it is given that

  tan(∠CAB) = 22/7.

We wish to find the area of triangle ABC.

Step 1. Choose a Coordinate System

Place BC horizontally along the x‑axis. Let D be the foot of the altitude from A onto BC. Since the altitude divides BC into segments of lengths 3 and 17, we can assume (without loss of generality) that
  B = (–3, 0), D = (0, 0), C = (17, 0)
so that BC = 3 + 17 = 20.

Since AD is the altitude from A, A lies vertically above D. So let
  A = (0, h)
with h > 0.

Step 2. Express tan(∠CAB) in terms of h

Angle ∠CAB is the angle between the rays AB and AC. The vectors from A to B and from A to C are:
  AB = B – A = (–3 – 0, 0 – h) = (–3, −h)
  AC = C – A = (17 – 0, 0 – h) = (17, −h)

To find the tangent of the angle between these vectors, we can use the formula
  tanθ = |u × v| / (u · v)
where “×” refers to the magnitude of the two‐dimensional cross product (or the determinant), and “·” is the dot product.

Calculate the determinant:
  |AB × AC| = |(–3)(–h) − (−h)(17)| = |3h + 17h| = 20h.

Calculate the dot product:
  AB · AC = (–3)(17) + (–h)(−h) = –51 + h² = h² − 51.

Thus,
  tan(∠CAB) = (20h)/(h² − 51).

Step 3. Use the Given tan(∠CAB) to Solve for h

We are given that
  (20h)/(h² − 51) = 22/7.
Cross multiply:
  20h · 7 = 22(h² − 51)
  140h = 22h² − 1122.
Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:
  22h² − 140h − 1122 = 0.
Divide through by 2 to simplify:
  11h² − 70h − 561 = 0.

Now apply the quadratic formula:
  h = [70 ± √(70² − 4·11·(−561))] / (2·11).

Compute the discriminant:
  Δ = 70² − 4·11·(−561) = 4900 + 24684 = 29584.
Notice that 29584 = (172)² when checked:
  172² = 29584.
So,
  h = (70 ± 172) / 22.
Since h > 0, choose the positive solution:
  h = (70 + 172) / 22 = 242/22 = 11.

Step 4. Compute the Area of Triangle ABC

The area T of a triangle is
  Area = ½ · (base) · (height).
Here, the base BC = 20 and the altitude (h) = 11. Therefore,
  Area = ½ · 20 · 11 = 10 · 11 = 110.

Final Answer

The area of triangle ABC is 110.
