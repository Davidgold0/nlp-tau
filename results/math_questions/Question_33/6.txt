Question: William is taking the 25-question, multiple choice American Mathematics Competition. Each question has five answer choices. William guesses random answers for the last four questions. What is the probability that he will get at least one of these final four questions right?
3o-mini: Since William is guessing randomly, the probability of getting any one question right is 1/5. For four questions, the probability of getting all four wrong (each with probability 4/5) is (4/5)^4 = 256/625.

Therefore, the probability that he gets at least one right is 1 minus the probability of getting none right:

1 - 256/625 = 369/625.
