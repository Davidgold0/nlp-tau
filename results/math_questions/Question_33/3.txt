Question: William is taking the 25-question, multiple choice American Mathematics Competition. Each question has five answer choices. William guesses random answers for the last four questions. What is the probability that he will get at least one of these final four questions right?
Teacher: Let's work through the problem together. To rephrase, William is guessing randomly on four multiple-choice questions, each with five answer choices. We’re looking for the probability that he gets at least one of these four questions correct.

Here’s an outline of the steps we can follow:

1. Determine the probability of guessing one question correctly.
2. Determine the probability of guessing one question incorrectly.
3. Use the fact that the questions are independent to calculate the probability that he gets all four questions wrong.
4. Finally, subtract that probability from 1 to get the probability that he gets at least one question right.

Now, let’s start with the first step:

What is the probability of guessing one question correctly? Please solve this step and share your answer.
Student: To determine the probability of guessing one question correctly, we need to consider that each question has five answer choices, and only one of those choices is correct. 

So, the probability of guessing one question correctly is:

\[
P(\text{correct}) = \frac{1 \text{ (correct choice)}}{5 \text{ (total choices)}} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

I have calculated that the probability of guessing one question correctly is \(\frac{1}{5}\). What should we do next?
Teacher: Great job! Your reasoning for the first step is correct: the probability of guessing one question correctly is indeed 1/5.

Now, let's move on to the next step. Can you determine the probability of guessing one question incorrectly? Please provide your calculation for this step.
Student: To determine the probability of guessing one question incorrectly, we can use the information from the previous step. Since there is one correct answer out of five choices, the remaining four choices are incorrect.

So, the probability of guessing one question incorrectly is:

\[
P(\text{incorrect}) = \frac{4 \text{ (incorrect choices)}}{5 \text{ (total choices)}} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

I have calculated that the probability of guessing one question incorrectly is \(\frac{4}{5}\). What should we do next?
Teacher: Great job! Your calculation for the probability of guessing one question incorrectly (4/5) is correct.

Now, let's move on to the next step:

Step 3: Calculate the probability that William gets all four questions wrong. Since the questions are independent, what expression would you use to find the probability that all four guesses are incorrect? Please work through this step and share your answer.
Student: To calculate the probability that William gets all four questions wrong, we can use the probability of getting one question wrong, which we found to be \(\frac{4}{5}\). Since the questions are independent, we can multiply the probabilities of getting each question wrong.

So, the probability that he gets all four questions wrong is:

\[
P(\text{all wrong}) = P(\text{incorrect}) \times P(\text{incorrect}) \times P(\text{incorrect}) \times P(\text{incorrect}) = \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^4
\]

Now, let's calculate \(\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^4\):

\[
\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^4 = \frac{4^4}{5^4} = \frac{256}{625}
\]

So, the probability that William gets all four questions wrong is \(\frac{256}{625}\). What should we do next?
Teacher: Excellent work on calculating that the probability of getting all four questions wrong is 256/625.

Now, for the final step: We need to find the probability that William gets at least one question right. How can you use the result from the previous step to calculate that probability? Please work through this step and share your answer.
Student: To find the probability that William gets at least one question right, we can use the result we calculated for the probability that he gets all four questions wrong.

The probability of getting at least one question right is the complement of the probability of getting all four questions wrong. We can express this mathematically as:

\[
P(\text{at least one correct}) = 1 - P(\text{all wrong})
\]

We already found that \(P(\text{all wrong}) = \frac{256}{625}\). Now we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[
P(\text{at least one correct}) = 1 - \frac{256}{625}
\]

To perform the subtraction, we need to express 1 as a fraction with a denominator of 625:

\[
1 = \frac{625}{625}
\]

Now we can subtract:

\[
P(\text{at least one correct}) = \frac{625}{625} - \frac{256}{625} = \frac{625 - 256}{625} = \frac{369}{625}
\]

Therefore, the probability that William gets at least one question right is \(\frac{369}{625}\). Would you like me to summarize our findings or clarify anything further?
Teacher: You've done a fantastic job working through this problem step by step! Let's quickly summarize what we've done:

1. You determined that the probability of guessing one question correctly is 1/5.
2. You found that the probability of guessing one question incorrectly is 4/5.
3. You computed that the probability of getting all four questions wrong is (4/5)^4 = 256/625.
4. Finally, you correctly used the complement rule to find the probability of getting at least one question right as 1 – 256/625, which simplified to 369/625.

Your final answer is: 369/625$
