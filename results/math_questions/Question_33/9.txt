Question: William is taking the 25-question, multiple choice American Mathematics Competition. Each question has five answer choices. William guesses random answers for the last four questions. What is the probability that he will get at least one of these final four questions right?
3o-mini: For each of the last four questions, the probability of guessing correctly is 1/5 and the probability of guessing incorrectly is 4/5. 

Since William guesses on all four questions independently, the probability that he gets all four wrong is (4/5)⁴.

Thus, the probability that he gets at least one question correct is:

  1 – (4/5)⁴ = 1 – (256/625) = (625 – 256)/625 = 369/625.

So, the probability is 369/625.
