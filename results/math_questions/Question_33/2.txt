Question: William is taking the 25-question, multiple choice American Mathematics Competition. Each question has five answer choices. William guesses random answers for the last four questions. What is the probability that he will get at least one of these final four questions right?
Teacher: Let's begin by outlining the steps together. We have a situation where William guesses on the last four questions. Since he is guessing, each question has a 1/5 chance of being correct and a 4/5 chance of being incorrect. 

Step 1: Calculate the probability that he gets every one of these four questions wrong. How would you express that probability?

Please work on this step and share your answer.
Student: To calculate the probability that William gets every one of the last four questions wrong, we start by identifying the probability of getting one question wrong. Since there are five answer choices and only one correct answer, the probability of getting a question wrong is:

\[
P(\text{wrong}) = \frac{4}{5}
\]

Since the questions are independent, we need to multiply the probability of getting a question wrong for all four questions:

\[
P(\text{all wrong}) = P(\text{wrong}) \times P(\text{wrong}) \times P(\text{wrong}) \times P(\text{wrong}) = \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^4
\]

Now, let's calculate \(\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^4\):

\[
\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^4 = \frac{4^4}{5^4} = \frac{256}{625}
\]

So, the probability that William gets all four questions wrong is \(\frac{256}{625}\). 

Does this look correct, Teacher?
Teacher: That's correctâ€”you've correctly calculated that the probability of getting all four questions wrong is (4/5)^4, which equals 256/625.

Now, let's move on to the next step. How can we use this result to find the probability that William gets at least one of the final four questions right? Please share your thoughts on this next step.
Student: To find the probability that William gets at least one of the final four questions right, we can use the complement rule. The complement of getting at least one question right is getting all questions wrong. 

Since we already calculated the probability of getting all four questions wrong, which is \(\frac{256}{625}\), we can find the probability of getting at least one question right by subtracting this value from 1:

\[
P(\text{at least one right}) = 1 - P(\text{all wrong}) = 1 - \frac{256}{625}
\]

Now, let's perform the subtraction:

\[
1 - \frac{256}{625} = \frac{625}{625} - \frac{256}{625} = \frac{625 - 256}{625} = \frac{369}{625}
\]

Therefore, the probability that William gets at least one of the final four questions right is \(\frac{369}{625}\). 

Does this make sense, Teacher?
Teacher: Great job! You correctly identified that the chance of getting a single question wrong is 4/5, so the probability that all four are wrong is (4/5)^4 = 256/625. Then, by applying the complement rule, you subtracted this from 1 to find that the probability of getting at least one right is 1 - 256/625 = 369/625.

You've completed the problem step by step perfectly.

The final answer is 369/625$
