Question: Natasha has more than $\$1$ but less than $\$10$ worth of dimes. When she puts her dimes in stacks of 3, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 4, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 5, she also has 1 left over. How many dimes does Natasha have?
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem into manageable steps. First, let’s rephrase the question in our own words:

Natasha has a number of dimes such that when she groups them in stacks of 3, 4, or 5, she always ends up with 1 dime left over. Also, since each dime is worth 10 cents, she has more than $1 but less than $10 in total. Our goal is to find out exactly how many dimes she has.

Here’s an outline of the steps we could take:

1. Determine the possible range for the number of dimes. (Remember, $1 is 10 dimes and $10 is 100 dimes, so think about what “more than $1” and “less than $10” mean in terms of the number of dimes.)
2. Translate the condition “when she puts her dimes in stacks of 3, 4, and 5, she always has 1 left over” into modular arithmetic conditions.
3. Notice that these conditions imply that the number of dimes, minus 1, is divisible by 3, 4, and 5. This leads to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5 and setting up an equation.
4. Find the specific number (or numbers) within the range determined in step 1 that satisfy this equation.

To begin, please work on step 1: Determine the range for the number of dimes Natasha could have given that her total value is more than $1 but less than $10. What is the smallest possible number of dimes and the largest possible number of dimes?
Student: To determine the range for the number of dimes Natasha could have, we need to convert the dollar amounts into the number of dimes.

Since each dime is worth 10 cents:
- More than $1 means she has more than 10 cents, which corresponds to more than 1 dime. Therefore, the smallest possible number of dimes is 2 (since 1 dime equals 10 cents).
- Less than $10 means she has less than 1000 cents, which corresponds to less than 100 dimes.

So, the possible range for the number of dimes Natasha could have is between 2 and 99 dimes. 

In summary:
- Smallest possible number of dimes: 2
- Largest possible number of dimes: 99

Is that correct, Teacher?
Teacher: You're on the right track attempting to convert dollars to dimes, but let's reconsider the conversion carefully.

Remember that one dime equals 10 cents. So:
- $1 is equivalent to how many dimes?
- $10 is equivalent to how many dimes?

Using these conversions, can you determine the correct range for the number of dimes Natasha could have, given that she has more than $1 but less than $10? Please solve just this conversion step.
Student: Thank you for your guidance, Teacher. Let's carefully convert the dollar amounts into the number of dimes.

1. Since each dime is worth 10 cents:
   - $1 is equivalent to 100 cents, which means Natasha has 10 dimes (because \(100 \div 10 = 10\)).
   - $10 is equivalent to 1000 cents, which means Natasha can have up to 100 dimes (because \(1000 \div 10 = 100\)).

Given that Natasha has more than $1 but less than $10, the range for the number of dimes would be:
- More than 10 dimes (which means at least 11 dimes).
- Less than 100 dimes.

So, the possible range for the number of dimes Natasha could have is between 11 and 99 dimes.

In summary:
- Smallest possible number of dimes: 11
- Largest possible number of dimes: 99

Is this correct, Teacher?
Teacher: You're doing well! Your conversion of dollars to dimes is correct: Natasha must have between 11 and 99 dimes. Now, let’s move to the next step.

Step 2: Translate the problem conditions into modular arithmetic. We’re given that:

• When Natasha's dimes are arranged in stacks of 3, there is 1 left over.
• When arranged in stacks of 4, there is 1 left over.
• When arranged in stacks of 5, there is 1 left over.

How can you express these conditions using modular arithmetic? In other words, if we let the number of dimes be D, could you write an equation (or equations) that shows D leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, 4, and 5? Please work on formulating just this part.
Student: Thank you for your guidance, Teacher. To express the conditions using modular arithmetic, we can let \( D \) represent the number of dimes. The conditions given in the problem can be translated into the following equations:

1. When arranged in stacks of 3, there is 1 left over:
   \[
   D \equiv 1 \mod 3
   \]

2. When arranged in stacks of 4, there is 1 left over:
   \[
   D \equiv 1 \mod 4
   \]

3. When arranged in stacks of 5, there is 1 left over:
   \[
   D \equiv 1 \mod 5
   \]

In summary, we have the following modular equations:
- \( D \equiv 1 \mod 3 \)
- \( D \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)
- \( D \equiv 1 \mod 5 \)

This means that \( D - 1 \) is divisible by 3, 4, and 5. Is this correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Great job! Your translation of the conditions into modular arithmetic is exactly right. You correctly set up that:

  D ≡ 1 (mod 3),
  D ≡ 1 (mod 4),
  and D ≡ 1 (mod 5).

This shows that D – 1 is divisible by 3, 4, and 5.

Now, let's move on to the next step: determining the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5. Could you please calculate the LCM of 3, 4, and 5? Focus just on this calculation for now.
Student: Thank you for your guidance, Teacher. To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5, we can follow these steps:

1. **List the prime factors**:
   - The prime factorization of 3 is \(3^1\).
   - The prime factorization of 4 is \(2^2\).
   - The prime factorization of 5 is \(5^1\).

2. **Identify the highest power of each prime**:
   - The highest power of 2 is \(2^2\) (from 4).
   - The highest power of 3 is \(3^1\) (from 3).
   - The highest power of 5 is \(5^1\) (from 5).

3. **Multiply these together to get the LCM**:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 = 4 \times 3 \times 5
   \]

Now, calculating this step-by-step:
- First, \(4 \times 3 = 12\).
- Then, \(12 \times 5 = 60\).

So, the least common multiple of 3, 4, and 5 is \(60\).

In summary:
- LCM(3, 4, 5) = 60.

Is this correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Nice work! The LCM of 3, 4, and 5 is indeed 60. 

Now, based on our earlier observation that D – 1 must be divisible by 3, 4, and 5, how can you express D – 1 in terms of this LCM? Please work on setting up that equation as the next step.
Student: Thank you for your guidance, Teacher. Since we have established that \( D - 1 \) is divisible by 3, 4, and 5, and we found that the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is 60, we can express this relationship as follows:

\[
D - 1 = 60k
\]

where \( k \) is some integer. 

Now, we can solve for \( D \):

\[
D = 60k + 1
\]

This equation tells us that the number of dimes \( D \) can be expressed in terms of \( k \). 

Next, we can substitute values for \( k \) to find possible values for \( D \) within our determined range of 11 to 99 dimes. 

Shall I go ahead and calculate those values for \( k \)?
Teacher: Great work! You've set up the equation correctly: D = 60k + 1, where k is some integer. Now, we need to use the fact that D is between 11 and 99 dimes. In other words, we have the inequality:

  11 ≤ 60k + 1 ≤ 99

For the next step, please solve this inequality to determine which integer values of k make D fall within the valid range. What is the value (or values) of k?
Student: Thank you for your guidance, Teacher. Let's solve the inequality \( 11 \leq 60k + 1 \leq 99 \) step by step.

1. **Start with the left side of the inequality**:
   \[
   11 \leq 60k + 1
   \]
   Subtract 1 from both sides:
   \[
   10 \leq 60k
   \]
   Now, divide both sides by 60:
   \[
   \frac{10}{60} \leq k
   \]
   Simplifying that gives:
   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \leq k
   \]

2. **Now, consider the right side of the inequality**:
   \[
   60k + 1 \leq 99
   \]
   Again, subtract 1 from both sides:
   \[
   60k \leq 98
   \]
   Now, divide both sides by 60:
   \[
   k \leq \frac{98}{60}
   \]
   Simplifying that gives:
   \[
   k \leq \frac{49}{30} \approx 1.6333
   \]

3. **Combine the results**:
   From the left side, we have \( k \geq \frac{1}{6} \) and from the right side, \( k \leq \frac{49}{30} \). Since \( k \) must be an integer, the possible integer values for \( k \) are 1 (since \( k = 0 \) would not satisfy the left side).

So, the only integer value for \( k \) that satisfies both parts of the inequality is:
- \( k = 1 \)

Now, shall I substitute \( k = 1 \) back into the equation \( D = 60k + 1 \) to find the number of dimes?
Teacher: Excellent work so far! You've determined that the only integer value for k is 1. Now, please substitute k = 1 into the equation D = 60k + 1 to find the number of dimes Natasha has. Once you've done that, confirm that the result is within the valid range of 11 and 99 dimes. What value do you get for D?
Student: Thank you for your guidance, Teacher. Let's substitute \( k = 1 \) into the equation \( D = 60k + 1 \):

\[
D = 60(1) + 1 = 60 + 1 = 61
\]

Now, we need to confirm that this value is within the valid range of 11 to 99 dimes:

- The number of dimes \( D = 61 \) is indeed greater than 11 and less than 99.

Thus, the number of dimes Natasha has is \( \boxed{61} \).

Is this correct, Teacher?
Teacher: Great job working through each step! You've determined that Natasha's number of dimes can be expressed as D = 60k + 1, and by analyzing the range (11 to 99), we found that k must be 1. Substituting k = 1, you correctly calculated D = 60(1) + 1 = 61, which falls within the required range.

Thus, the final answer is 61$
