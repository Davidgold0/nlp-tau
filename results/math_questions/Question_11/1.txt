Question: Natasha has more than $\$1$ but less than $\$10$ worth of dimes. When she puts her dimes in stacks of 3, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 4, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 5, she also has 1 left over. How many dimes does Natasha have?
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down what the problem is asking in our own words:

Natasha has a number of dimes (remember, each dime is 10 cents). The total value is more than $1 and less than $10, so the number of dimes (let’s call it x) must be between 11 and 99. In addition, when Natasha arranges her dimes in stacks of 3, 4, and 5, she always has 1 dime left over. That gives us the conditions:  
  x mod 3 = 1  
  x mod 4 = 1  
  x mod 5 = 1  

A key observation is that if you subtract 1 from x, the result is divisible by 3, 4, and 5. 

Here are the steps we can follow to solve this problem:
1. Define x as the total number of dimes and note the range 11 ≤ x ≤ 99.
2. Write the congruences: x ≡ 1 (mod 3), x ≡ 1 (mod 4), x ≡ 1 (mod 5).
3. Notice that means x - 1 is divisible by 3, 4, and 5.
4. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5.
5. Express x - 1 as LCM × k for some integer k, so that x = (LCM × k) + 1.
6. Determine which value of k makes x fall in the correct range.

Let’s start with step 4. Can you calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5?
Student: To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5, we can follow these steps:

1. **List the prime factors**:
   - The prime factorization of 3 is \(3^1\).
   - The prime factorization of 4 is \(2^2\).
   - The prime factorization of 5 is \(5^1\).

2. **Take the highest power of each prime factor**:
   - For the prime number 2, the highest power is \(2^2\) (from 4).
   - For the prime number 3, the highest power is \(3^1\) (from 3).
   - For the prime number 5, the highest power is \(5^1\) (from 5).

3. **Multiply these together**:
   \[
   LCM = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 = 4 \times 3 \times 5
   \]

4. **Calculate the product step by step**:
   - First, \(4 \times 3 = 12\).
   - Then, \(12 \times 5 = 60\).

So, the least common multiple of 3, 4, and 5 is **60**. 

Now, we can move on to the next step. Would you like to proceed with expressing \(x - 1\) as \(60k\) and finding the values of \(k\) that keep \(x\) within the specified range?
Teacher: Great job finding the LCM! Now let's move on to the next step. We know that if Natasha has x dimes, then x − 1 must be divisible by 60. This means we can write:

  x − 1 = 60k   for some integer k

or equivalently,

  x = 60k + 1

Since Natasha has more than $1 but less than $10 in dimes—and remembering each dime is 10 cents—the number of dimes must be between 11 and 99. 

Now, using the equation x = 60k + 1, what value(s) of k will ensure that x falls within the range 11 ≤ x ≤ 99? Please solve this step and share your reasoning.
Student: To find the values of \( k \) that keep \( x \) within the specified range of 11 to 99, we can substitute the equation \( x = 60k + 1 \) into the inequality:

1. **Set up the inequalities**:
   \[
   11 \leq 60k + 1 \leq 99
   \]

2. **Solve the left inequality**:
   \[
   11 \leq 60k + 1
   \]
   Subtract 1 from both sides:
   \[
   10 \leq 60k
   \]
   Divide by 60:
   \[
   \frac{10}{60} \leq k \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{1}{6} \leq k
   \]

3. **Solve the right inequality**:
   \[
   60k + 1 \leq 99
   \]
   Subtract 1 from both sides:
   \[
   60k \leq 98
   \]
   Divide by 60:
   \[
   k \leq \frac{98}{60} \quad \Rightarrow \quad k \leq \frac{49}{30} \quad \Rightarrow \quad k \leq 1.6333
   \]

4. **Determine integer values for \( k \)**:
   Since \( k \) must be an integer, the possible values for \( k \) are:
   \[
   k = 1
   \]

Now, let's substitute \( k = 1 \) back into the equation for \( x \):
\[
x = 60(1) + 1 = 61
\]

Finally, we check if \( x = 61 \) is within the specified range of 11 to 99, which it is. 

Therefore, Natasha has **61 dimes**. Would you like to review any part of this solution or proceed to check if it meets all the original conditions?
Teacher: Excellent work so far! You've correctly determined that k = 1 leads to x = 61 dimes. Now let's go to the next step: we need to ensure that 61 dimes indeed satisfy the original conditions for the remainders.

Recall, the problem stated that when Natasha arranges her dimes in stacks of 3, 4, or 5, there is always 1 dime left over. This means:
  61 mod 3 = 1,
  61 mod 4 = 1,
  61 mod 5 = 1.

Can you verify, step by step, that 61 meets these conditions? Please begin by checking the remainder when 61 is divided by 3.
Student: To verify that 61 meets the conditions of the problem, we will check the remainders for each of the specified moduli: 3, 4, and 5.

1. **Check \( 61 \mod 3 \)**:
   - We divide 61 by 3:
     \[
     61 \div 3 = 20 \quad \text{(the quotient)}
     \]
   - Now, multiply the quotient by 3:
     \[
     20 \times 3 = 60
     \]
   - Subtract this from 61 to find the remainder:
     \[
     61 - 60 = 1
     \]
   - Therefore, \( 61 \mod 3 = 1 \).

2. **Check \( 61 \mod 4 \)**:
   - We divide 61 by 4:
     \[
     61 \div 4 = 15 \quad \text{(the quotient)}
     \]
   - Multiply the quotient by 4:
     \[
     15 \times 4 = 60
     \]
   - Subtract this from 61 to find the remainder:
     \[
     61 - 60 = 1
     \]
   - Therefore, \( 61 \mod 4 = 1 \).

3. **Check \( 61 \mod 5 \)**:
   - We divide 61 by 5:
     \[
     61 \div 5 = 12 \quad \text{(the quotient)}
     \]
   - Multiply the quotient by 5:
     \[
     12 \times 5 = 60
     \]
   - Subtract this from 61 to find the remainder:
     \[
     61 - 60 = 1
     \]
   - Therefore, \( 61 \mod 5 = 1 \).

Since all conditions are satisfied:
- \( 61 \mod 3 = 1 \)
- \( 61 \mod 4 = 1 \)
- \( 61 \mod 5 = 1 \)

We can conclude that Natasha indeed has **61 dimes**. Would you like to discuss anything else related to this problem?
Teacher: You've done a great job working through the solution! To summarize briefly:

1. We set up the equation x = 60k + 1 because x − 1 must be divisible by the LCM of 3, 4, and 5 (which is 60).
2. By ensuring x falls within the range where the total number of dimes is between 11 and 99, we found k = 1, leading to x = 61.
3. Finally, you confirmed that 61 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, 4, and 5.

Well done! The final answer is:
61$
