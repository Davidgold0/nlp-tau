Question: Mary and James each sit in a row of 7 chairs.  They choose their seats at random.  What is the probability that they don't sit next to each other?
Teacher: Let's break this problem down step by step. Here's an outline of the approach:

1. First, determine the total number of ways Mary and James can choose their seats from the 7 chairs.
2. Next, figure out how many arrangements result in them sitting next to each other.
3. Subtract the number of "adjacent" seating arrangements from the total number of arrangements to get the number of arrangements where they are not neighbors.
4. Finally, calculate the probability by dividing the number of non-adjacent arrangements by the total number of arrangements and simplify if possible.

Let's start with the first step. Can you explain how you would determine the total number of seating arrangements for Mary and James? (Only solve this step, please.)
Student: To determine the total number of ways Mary and James can choose their seats from the 7 chairs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Choose a seat for Mary**: Mary can sit in any of the 7 chairs. So, there are 7 options for her.
  
2. **Choose a seat for James**: After Mary has chosen her seat, James can sit in any of the remaining 6 chairs (since he cannot sit in the same chair as Mary).

Now, we multiply the number of choices for Mary by the number of choices for James:

Total arrangements = (Number of choices for Mary) × (Number of choices for James)  
Total arrangements = 7 × 6 = 42

So, there are 42 total ways for Mary and James to choose their seats from the 7 chairs.
Teacher: Great job! Your explanation for determining the total number of seating arrangements is correct. You properly considered that Mary has 7 choices and, after her choice, James has 6 remaining, giving you 7 × 6 = 42 total arrangements.

Now, let's move on to the next step: figuring out how many ways Mary and James can sit next to each other. Could you start by explaining how you would determine the number of pairs of adjacent chairs in a row of 7 chairs? (Only solve this step, please.)
Student: To determine the number of pairs of adjacent chairs in a row of 7 chairs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the pairs**: When we look at the row of 7 chairs, we can think of each pair of adjacent chairs as a grouping. The pairs are formed by the following combinations:
   - Chairs 1 and 2
   - Chairs 2 and 3
   - Chairs 3 and 4
   - Chairs 4 and 5
   - Chairs 5 and 6
   - Chairs 6 and 7

2. **Count the pairs**: From the list above, we can see that there are a total of 6 pairs of adjacent chairs.

So, there are 6 pairs of adjacent chairs in a row of 7 chairs. 

Next, we can use this information to figure out how many ways Mary and James can sit next to each other. Would you like me to proceed with that?
Teacher: Great job identifying the 6 pairs of adjacent chairs! Now, let’s move to the next part: determining how many seating arrangements place Mary and James next to each other.

Consider this:  
– For each adjacent pair of chairs, how many ways can Mary and James occupy those two chairs?  
– Once you figure that out, multiply that result by the number of pairs.

Could you explain your reasoning and calculate the number of seating arrangements where Mary and James sit next to each other? Please solve just this step.
Student: To determine how many seating arrangements place Mary and James next to each other, we can follow these steps:

1. **Consider each pair of adjacent chairs**: We identified that there are 6 pairs of adjacent chairs. For each of these pairs, we can think of Mary and James as a single unit or block because they are sitting next to each other.

2. **Count arrangements within each pair**: For each pair of adjacent chairs, Mary and James can occupy the two chairs in two different ways: either Mary sits in the first chair and James in the second, or James sits in the first chair and Mary in the second. Thus, for each pair, there are 2 arrangements.

3. **Calculate the total arrangements**: Since there are 6 pairs of adjacent chairs and 2 arrangements for each pair, we multiply the number of pairs by the arrangements per pair:

Total arrangements where Mary and James sit next to each other = (Number of pairs) × (Arrangements per pair)  
Total arrangements = 6 × 2 = 12

So, there are 12 ways for Mary and James to sit next to each other. Would you like to move on to the next step?
Teacher: Great work so far! Now let's move on to the next part of the problem.

We already calculated:
1. The total number of seating arrangements is 42.
2. The number of arrangements where Mary and James sit next to each other is 12.

Now, here's the next step:  
a. Determine the number of seating arrangements where Mary and James are NOT sitting next to each other.  
b. Then, use that to calculate the probability that they do not sit next to each other.

Remember, you can find the non-adjacent arrangements by subtracting the number of adjacent arrangements from the total arrangements.

Can you explain your reasoning for this step and perform the necessary calculation? Please work through just this step.
Student: To determine the number of seating arrangements where Mary and James are NOT sitting next to each other, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total arrangements**: We already know that the total number of seating arrangements for Mary and James is 42.

2. **Adjacent arrangements**: We also calculated that the number of arrangements where Mary and James sit next to each other is 12.

3. **Calculate non-adjacent arrangements**: To find the number of arrangements where they are not sitting next to each other, we subtract the number of adjacent arrangements from the total arrangements:

Non-adjacent arrangements = Total arrangements - Adjacent arrangements  
Non-adjacent arrangements = 42 - 12 = 30

So, there are 30 arrangements where Mary and James do not sit next to each other.

Next, we can use this information to calculate the probability that they do not sit next to each other. Would you like me to proceed with that?
Teacher: Great work so far! You've correctly determined that there are 30 seating arrangements where Mary and James don't sit next to each other.

Now, let's move on to the final part: calculating the probability that they don't sit next to each other. 

Remember, the probability is given by the ratio:
  Probability = (Number of non-adjacent arrangements) / (Total number of arrangements)

Using your numbers, can you calculate this probability and simplify the fraction if possible? Please solve only this step.
Student: To calculate the probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other, we can use the formula for probability:

\[ 
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of non-adjacent arrangements}}{\text{Total number of arrangements}} 
\]

From our previous calculations, we know:

- Number of non-adjacent arrangements = 30
- Total number of arrangements = 42

Now, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ 
\text{Probability} = \frac{30}{42} 
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction. Both 30 and 42 can be divided by 6:

\[ 
\frac{30 \div 6}{42 \div 6} = \frac{5}{7} 
\]

So, the probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other is \( \frac{5}{7} \).
Teacher: Excellent work! Your reasoning is clear, and you've reached the correct conclusion. The probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other is 5/7$
