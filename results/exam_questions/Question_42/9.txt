Question: \textit{We will implement an n-bit binary counter. The counter is initialized to the value 0...00. The Inc operation advances the counter, i.e., increases its value by 1 as follows. The operation searches sequentially for the rightmost 0, turns it into a 1, and turns all the 1s to its right into 0s. If the state of the counter is 1...11, then advancing it will change its state to 00...0. For example, if n=5 and the counter state is currently 00111, then after the Inc operation, the counter state will be 01000. After another Inc operation, the counter state will be 01001. The cost of an operation is defined as the number of bits whose value is changed by the operation. For example, the cost of advancing the counter in the example from 00111 to 01000 is 4, since 4 bits changed their value. The answer should be exact, not asymptotic in terms of O(). What is the cost of the Inc operation in the worst case?
3o-mini: In the worst case, the Inc operation flips n bits. This happens when all n bits are 1 (i.e., the counter is 11...1). Since the operation resets all bits to 0, each bit is flipped, resulting in exactly n changes.
