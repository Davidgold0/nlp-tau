Question: \textit{We will implement an n-bit binary counter. The counter is initialized to the value 0...00. The Inc operation advances the counter, i.e., increases its value by 1 as follows. The operation searches sequentially for the rightmost 0, turns it into a 1, and turns all the 1s to its right into 0s. If the state of the counter is 1...11, then advancing it will change its state to 00...0. For example, if n=5 and the counter state is currently 00111, then after the Inc operation, the counter state will be 01000. After another Inc operation, the counter state will be 01001. The cost of an operation is defined as the number of bits whose value is changed by the operation. For example, the cost of advancing the counter in the example from 00111 to 01000 is 4, since 4 bits changed their value. The answer should be exact, not asymptotic in terms of O(). What is the cost of the Inc operation in the worst case?
Teacher: Let's start by making sure we understand the problem well. We have an n-bit binary counter that increases its value by 1. In doing so, it looks for the rightmost 0, flips it to 1, and turns all bits to its right into 0s. This means that if the counter is in the state where all bits are 1 (e.g., 111...1), then the Inc operation will flip every bit to 0. 

Step 1: Identify what configuration of the counter will result in the Inc operation flipping the maximum number of bits. 

Can you tell me which counter state would cause the maximum number of bits to change, and why that is the case?
Student: Sure! The configuration of the counter that would cause the maximum number of bits to change during the Inc operation is when the counter is in the state where all bits are set to 1, which is represented as \( 111...1 \) (for example, if \( n = 5 \), this would be \( 11111 \)).

In this case, when we perform the Inc operation, the rightmost 0 cannot be found because there are no 0s in the counter. As a result, the operation will flip every bit from 1 to 0. Since there are \( n \) bits in total, all \( n \) bits will change their value.

This is the worst-case scenario because it results in the maximum number of bits being flipped. So, for a counter with \( n \) bits in the state \( 111...1 \), the Inc operation will change all \( n \) bits to 0. 

Would you like me to proceed to the next step?
Teacher: Great job on identifying the worst-case configuration! You correctly noted that when the counter is all 1s—for instance, 1111…1—the Inc operation will flip every bit, leading to the maximum number of flips.

For the next step, let’s connect this observation with the cost of the Inc operation. Recall, the cost is defined as the number of bits whose value changes during the operation.

Can you now express the cost of the Inc operation for this worst-case scenario in terms of n? Please show your reasoning for finding this cost.
Student: Student: Sure! In the worst-case scenario we identified, where the counter state is \( 111...1 \) (all bits are 1), the Inc operation will flip every single bit from 1 to 0.

Since there are \( n \) bits in total in the counter, and all of them change their value during the Inc operation, the cost of the operation can be expressed as follows:

- Cost = Number of bits changed = \( n \)

Thus, in this worst-case scenario, the cost of the Inc operation is exactly \( n \).

Would you like me to summarize everything we've discussed?
Teacher: Great work summarizing the reasoning! You correctly identified that the maximum cost occurs when the counter is in the state of all 1s, because then each of the n bits is flipped during the Inc operation.

For clarity, here’s a quick recap of our steps:
1. We determined that the worst-case scenario for the Inc operation is when the counter is 111...1.
2. In this worst-case, every bit is flipped (each from 1 to 0).
3. Since there are n bits and all flip, the cost is n.

Now, please provide your final answer in terms of n for the worst-case cost. What do you conclude?
Student: In conclusion, the cost of the Inc operation in the worst-case scenario, where the counter is in the state \( 111...1 \) (all bits are 1), is exactly \( n \). This is because all \( n \) bits change their value from 1 to 0 during the operation.
Teacher: Excellent work! Your final answer is: n$
