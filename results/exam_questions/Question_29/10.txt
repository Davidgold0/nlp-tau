Question: Is it possible to implement an AVL tree such that the worst-case time complexity of the insert operation is \( O(1) \) and the delete operation takes \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the tree?
3o-mini: An AVL tree is defined by the invariant that it is height‐balanced, which is what guarantees logarithmic search, insert, and delete times. Inserting an item into an AVL tree requires finding the correct insertion point (which takes O(log n) time when the tree is balanced) and then possibly doing a series of rotations (each of which is O(1) per operation but may need to be applied along the insertion path, still yielding O(log n) worst‐case time). 

If you try to “cheat” and make the insert operation O(1) worst-case, you would have to avoid doing the necessary work (i.e. the search for the insertion point or the rebalancing). One could imagine a scheme where insertion is done very quickly (perhaps by “lazily” deferring rebalancing until later), but then when you go to delete a node (or even search), you might end up doing a lot more work (say O(n)) to “fix up” the tree and restore the AVL property. However, this isn’t really an AVL tree anymore—one of the main features and guarantees of AVL trees is that they maintain strict balance at all times so that all operations run in O(log n) in the worst case.

In other words, if you design an algorithm where inserts are O(1) worst-case and deletes are O(n), then you are not really implementing a standard AVL tree; you’re simply delaying the costs of balancing from the insert to the delete. This deferral would ruin the very guarantee that motivates the use of AVL trees (namely, quickly searchable, balanced trees). 

So the answer is: No, you cannot implement an AVL tree so that insert runs in O(1) worst-case time while delete takes O(n) worst-case, without sacrificing the AVL tree’s balancing invariants and its guarantee of logarithmic-time operations.
