Question: Given \(n\) segments on the line (i.e., the input is \(n\) pairs \((x, y)\) of start and end points), a segment is called "central" if there are at least \(n/4\) segments starting before it (its start point is to the left of its start point) and at least \(n/4\) segments ending after it (its end point is to the right of its end point). Propose an algorithm that returns the number of central segments, with the best possible Worst Case running time, and analyze its running time.
3o-mini: We can solve the problem in O(n) worst‐case time by “reducing” it to selection and a single scan. (Any algorithm that sorts the segments would take O(n log n) time, which is not optimal.) Here is one way to do it.

Let the input be n segments whose endpoints are given as pairs (x, y) (assume “x” is the start and “y” is the end). A segment is “central” if

  • at least n/4 segments start before it (i.e. have x–value less than its x–value) and
  • at least n/4 segments end after it (i.e. have y–value greater than its y–value).

The key observation is that if we sort all the start points in increasing order then each segment’s “start rank” (its index in the sorted order) tells us how many segments start before it. (You might have to be careful with ties, but we assume here that endpoints are all distinct or that ties are broken consistently.) Similarly, we can determine the rank (in increasing order) of the end values.

Let’s denote by rank_x(s) the number of segments that start before segment s (its “position” among the x–values) and by rank_y(s) the position among the y–values (so the number of segments ending before s). Then the two conditions are equivalent to:

  1. rank_x(s) ≥ n/4    [meaning there are at least n/4 segments with x–value smaller than s.x]
  2. (n – rank_y(s) – 1) ≥ n/4  [meaning at least n/4 segments have y–value greater than s.y]

because if rank_y(s) is the number of segments ending before s then n – rank_y(s) – 1 is the number ending after s.

Rather than sorting all the segments (which would take O(n log n) time), we note that we do not care about the entire order but only about a “threshold” value.

Step 1. Find the x–threshold:
  Use a linear–time selection algorithm (for example, the median‐of‐medians algorithm) to find the (⌊n/4⌋)th smallest x–value among the segments. Denote this value by x_threshold.
A segment that starts at or after x_threshold is guaranteed to have at least n/4 segments beginning before it.

Step 2. Find the y–threshold:
  Similarly, we want the segment to have at least n/4 segments ending after it. Notice that if we sort the y–values in increasing order, then a segment s with s.y at most the value at the (n – ⌊n/4⌋)th position (if we index from 1) or, equivalently, if its rank (starting at 0) is at most n – n/4 – 1, will have at least n/4 segments ending after it.
  Use the linear–time selection algorithm to find the (n – ⌊n/4⌋)th smallest y–value. Call this y_threshold.

Step 3. Count the central segments:
  Scan through the list of segments once. For each segment s = (x, y), check if
    x ≥ x_threshold  AND  y ≤ y_threshold.
  Count each segment that meets both conditions.

Running Time Analysis:
  • Finding x_threshold takes O(n) worst–case time.
  • Finding y_threshold takes O(n) worst–case time.
  • The final scan takes O(n) time.
Thus, the entire algorithm runs in O(n) worst–case time.

Remarks:
– (If endpoints are not distinct and tie–breaking is an issue, slight adjustments are needed to count “at least” n/4 segments; however, the overall idea and running time remain the same.)
– This algorithm is asymptotically optimal in the worst case (since reading the input requires O(n) time).

To summarize, the algorithm is:

1. Use a linear–time selection algorithm to find x_threshold, the ⌊n/4⌋th smallest start value.
2. Use a linear–time selection algorithm to find y_threshold, the (n – ⌊n/4⌋)th smallest end value.
3. For each segment (x, y), if x ≥ x_threshold and y ≤ y_threshold then count it as a central segment.
4. Return the count.

This yields an O(n) worst–case running time solution.
