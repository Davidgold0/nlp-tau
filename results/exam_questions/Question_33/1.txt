Question: We build a hashing table of size \( m \) using the open addressing method (i.e., all the elements are in the hashing table without using pointers). We use a randomly chosen hash function of the form \( h(k, i) \), where \( k \) is the key that we want to insert into the table, and \( i \) is the probe number. (This is the uniform probing method. The value returned by calling \( h(k, i) \) is a uniformly chosen integer between 2 and \( m-1 \), independent of the previous random selections). The table already contains \( n \) distinct elements. We now perform a search for an element that is not in the table. What is the expected number of table slots examined during the search? Provide as tight a non-asymptotic answer as possible.
Teacher: Let's begin by discussing how to break down the problem. We have a hash table of size m that already contains n elements. When we search for an element that is not in the table, we are probing table slots using a hash function h(k, i) that at each probe i returns a uniformly random index (from a given range, but essentially we can think of it as a random slot). The search stops as soon as we hit an empty slot.

To outline a plan for solving this:

1. Identify the probability that a randomly probed slot is occupied. (Hint: What fraction of the slots are occupied?)
2. Recognize that each probe can be thought of as an independent trial (thanks to the randomness stipulated), where the “success” is finding an empty slot.
3. Model the probing process using a geometric random variable with success probability p (where p is the probability that a probed slot is empty).
4. Use the formula for the expected number of trials in a geometric distribution (E[T] = 1/p) to obtain your final expression.

Let’s start with step 1: What is the probability that a randomly chosen slot (from the available m slots) is occupied? Please share your thought process and answer for this step.
Student: To determine the probability that a randomly chosen slot is occupied, we need to consider the number of slots in the hash table and how many of those slots are filled with elements.

1. **Total slots in the hash table**: \( m \)
2. **Slots already occupied**: \( n \) (the number of distinct elements already in the table)

The probability that a randomly chosen slot is occupied can be calculated as the ratio of occupied slots to the total number of slots. 

So, the probability \( P(\text{occupied}) \) is given by:

\[
P(\text{occupied}) = \frac{n}{m}
\]

Consequently, the probability that a randomly chosen slot is empty, \( P(\text{empty}) \), would be:

\[
P(\text{empty}) = 1 - P(\text{occupied}) = 1 - \frac{n}{m} = \frac{m - n}{m}
\]

This means that the probability that a randomly probed slot is empty is \( \frac{m - n}{m} \).

Does this make sense? Should I move on to the next step?
Teacher: Your explanation is clear and correct! You correctly determined that the probability a randomly chosen slot is occupied is n/m, so the probability a slot is empty is (m – n)/m. Great job!

Let's move on to step 2: Since each probe is independent and we stop when we hit an empty slot, we can model the probing process as a geometric random variable. Given that the probability of success (finding an empty slot) is (m – n)/m, how would you express the expected number of probes using the geometric distribution? Please share your reasoning for this step.
Student: Student: Thank you for the feedback! Now, moving on to step 2, since we are dealing with a geometric random variable, we can express the expected number of probes needed to find an empty slot.

In a geometric distribution, the expected number of trials \( E[T] \) until the first success (in this case, finding an empty slot) is given by the formula:

\[
E[T] = \frac{1}{p}
\]

where \( p \) is the probability of success. Here, our success is defined as finding an empty slot, which, as we calculated, has the probability:

\[
p = P(\text{empty}) = \frac{m - n}{m}
\]

Thus, substituting \( p \) into the expected value formula, we get:

\[
E[T] = \frac{1}{\frac{m - n}{m}} = \frac{m}{m - n}
\]

This means that the expected number of table slots examined during the search for an element that is not in the table is \( \frac{m}{m - n} \).

Does this reasoning look good to you? Should I proceed to summarize the final answer?
Teacher: Excellent work so far! Your reasoning is spot on. You correctly calculated that the probability that a randomly chosen slot is empty is (m – n)/m and then used the geometric distribution to obtain the expected number of probes as m⁄(m – n).

Before we conclude, could you please summarize your reasoning and then provide your final answer? Remember, the final answer should be expressed as the expected number of table slots examined during the search for an element not in the table. Once you’re ready, type your final answer, ensuring that it is followed immediately by a $ with nothing else after it.
Student: Sure! Here’s a summary of my reasoning:

1. We have a hash table of size \( m \) that contains \( n \) distinct elements.
2. The probability that a randomly chosen slot is occupied is \( \frac{n}{m} \), which means the probability that a randomly chosen slot is empty is \( \frac{m - n}{m} \).
3. Since each probe is independent, we can model the search process as a geometric random variable, where the expected number of trials until the first success (finding an empty slot) is given by \( E[T] = \frac{1}{p} \).
4. Substituting \( p \) with \( \frac{m - n}{m} \), we find that \( E[T] = \frac{m}{m - n} \).

Thus, the expected number of table slots examined during the search for an element that is not in the table is:

\[
\frac{m}{m - n}
\]

Final answer: \(\frac{m}{m - n} \)$
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly broken down the problem as follows:

1. You determined that in a hash table of m slots containing n elements, the probability that a randomly probed slot is occupied is n/m, so the probability that it is empty is (m – n)/m.
2. By modeling the process as a geometric random variable where “success” is finding an empty slot, you applied the formula for the expected number of probes as E[T] = 1/p.
3. Substituting p = (m – n)/m, you obtained E[T] = m/(m – n).

Your final answer, therefore, is:

m/(m - n)$
