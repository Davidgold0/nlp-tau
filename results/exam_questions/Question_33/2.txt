Question: We build a hashing table of size \( m \) using the open addressing method (i.e., all the elements are in the hashing table without using pointers). We use a randomly chosen hash function of the form \( h(k, i) \), where \( k \) is the key that we want to insert into the table, and \( i \) is the probe number. (This is the uniform probing method. The value returned by calling \( h(k, i) \) is a uniformly chosen integer between 2 and \( m-1 \), independent of the previous random selections). The table already contains \( n \) distinct elements. We now perform a search for an element that is not in the table. What is the expected number of table slots examined during the search? Provide as tight a non-asymptotic answer as possible.
Teacher: Let's start by breaking the problem down into manageable steps. One way to approach this problem is as follows:

1. Restate and understand the search process:
 a. We have a hash table of size m that already contains n distinct elements.
 b. A search for an element that is not in the table is performed using a probe sequence h(k, i), where each probe is independent and uniformly random over the available slots.
 c. In an unsuccessful search, the probing continues until an empty slot is found.
2. Identify the probability in a single probe:
 a. What is the probability that a random slot is empty (and can terminate the search)?
 b. Conversely, what is the probability that the slot is occupied?
3. Model the process:
 a. Think about modeling the number of probes required as a geometric random variable, where “success” means finding an empty slot.
 b. Write down the formula for the expected value of a geometric random variable in terms of the success probability.
4. Combine the steps to get a tight non-asymptotic answer.

Let’s begin with step 1: Please describe, in your own words, how you understand the search process for the element. Focus on how the probing mechanism works and what constitutes a “probe” in this context. What does finding an empty slot represent in your model?
Student: In the search process for an element that is not in the hash table, we start by attempting to locate the element using the probing mechanism defined by the hash function \( h(k, i) \). 

1. **Understanding the Probing Mechanism**:
   - Each probe is an attempt to access a slot in the hash table. The function \( h(k, i) \) generates a random index based on the key \( k \) and the probe number \( i \). The index is uniformly chosen from the range of available slots (from 2 to \( m-1 \)).
   - When we perform a search, we begin with \( i = 0 \) (the first probe) and increment \( i \) for each subsequent probe until we either find the element or encounter an empty slot.

2. **What Constitutes a Probe**:
   - A "probe" refers to each individual attempt to access a slot in the hash table. During each probe, we check if the slot is occupied by an existing element or if it is empty.
   - If the slot is occupied, we continue probing by increasing \( i \) and generating a new index using \( h(k, i) \). If we find an empty slot, this indicates that the search for the element has failed, as it confirms that the element is not in the table.

3. **Finding an Empty Slot**:
   - In this context, finding an empty slot represents a successful termination of the search process. Since we are looking for an element that is not present in the table, the search will continue until we encounter an empty slot, which signifies that the element cannot be found in the hash table.

Overall, the search process is characterized by repeated probing until an empty slot is found, which indicates that the search for the non-existent element has concluded. 

Now that I've described the search process, would you like me to move on to step 2 and discuss the probabilities associated with probing?
Teacher: Great explanation of the probing process! I have a couple of points to clarify before we move on:

• You explained that we start with i = 0, but note that according to the problem statement the hash function h(k, i) generates a random slot from the range 2 to m - 1. So, regardless of the value of i, each probe gives a uniformly random slot from that set.

• Your explanation of a probe as the process of checking a slot for occupancy is spot on. Finding an empty slot indeed terminates the search because it proves that the element isn’t in the table.

Now, let’s move to step 2. In this step, we need to determine the probabilities associated with a single probe. Specifically:

• Given that the table has m slots and already contains n entries, what is the probability that any one probe (i.e., a randomly chosen slot from the allowed indices) is empty? Explain your reasoning, taking into account the number of empty slots relative to the total number of slot choices.

Please work out this part and share your steps for calculating the probability of a probe hitting an empty slot.
Student: Student: Thank you for the clarification! Let's work through step 2 and calculate the probabilities associated with a single probe.

1. **Total Slots and Occupied Slots**:
   - We have a hash table of size \( m \).
   - The table already contains \( n \) distinct elements, meaning there are \( n \) occupied slots.

2. **Calculating Empty Slots**:
   - The number of empty slots in the hash table is given by:
     \[
     \text{Number of empty slots} = m - n
     \]

3. **Probability of Hitting an Empty Slot**:
   - Since the hash function \( h(k, i) \) generates a uniformly random slot from the range \( [2, m-1] \), we need to consider how many slots are available for probing.
   - The total number of slots available for probing is \( m - 1 \) (considering slots from 2 to \( m-1 \)).
   - The probability \( P(\text{empty}) \) that a randomly chosen slot is empty can be calculated as the ratio of empty slots to the total number of available slots:
     \[
     P(\text{empty}) = \frac{\text{Number of empty slots}}{\text{Total slots available}} = \frac{m - n}{m - 1}
     \]

4. **Probability of Hitting an Occupied Slot**:
   - Conversely, the probability \( P(\text{occupied}) \) that a randomly chosen slot is occupied is:
     \[
     P(\text{occupied}) = 1 - P(\text{empty}) = \frac{n}{m - 1}
     \]

In summary, the probability of hitting an empty slot during a probe is \( \frac{m - n}{m - 1} \), and the probability of hitting an occupied slot is \( \frac{n}{m - 1} \).

Would you like me to proceed to step 3 and model the probing process as a geometric random variable?
Teacher: You've done a good job setting up the reasoning and working through the probabilities conceptually. However, remember that the hash function h(k, i) returns a uniformly random integer between 2 and m – 1. This means that, for each probe, the slot is chosen uniformly from the set of slots {2, 3, …, m – 1}. How many possible slots does that give?

It gives m – 2 possible slots, not m – 1. Therefore, when you compute the probability of encountering an empty slot per probe, you should use m – 2 as the total number of choices instead of m – 1.

Could you adjust your calculation for the probability of an empty probe using this corrected total? Explain your reasoning step by step.
Student: Thank you for pointing that out! Let's adjust the calculation for the probability of hitting an empty slot based on the correct total number of possible slots. 

1. **Total Slots**:
   - The hash table has \( m \) slots in total.
   - The slots available for probing, according to the problem statement, are from 2 to \( m - 1 \). Therefore, the total number of available slots for probing is:
     \[
     m - 2
     \]

2. **Occupied and Empty Slots**:
   - We still have \( n \) distinct elements in the table, which means there are \( n \) occupied slots. Thus, the number of empty slots is:
     \[
     \text{Number of empty slots} = m - n
     \]

3. **Calculating the Probability of Hitting an Empty Slot**:
   - The probability \( P(\text{empty}) \) that a randomly chosen slot is empty can now be calculated as the ratio of the number of empty slots to the total number of slots available for probing:
     \[
     P(\text{empty}) = \frac{\text{Number of empty slots}}{\text{Total slots available}} = \frac{m - n}{m - 2}
     \]

4. **Calculating the Probability of Hitting an Occupied Slot**:
   - The probability \( P(\text{occupied}) \) that a randomly chosen slot is occupied is:
     \[
     P(\text{occupied}) = 1 - P(\text{empty}) = \frac{n}{m - 2}
     \]

In summary, with the corrected total number of probing slots, the probability of hitting an empty slot during a probe is \( \frac{m - n}{m - 2} \), and the probability of hitting an occupied slot is \( \frac{n}{m - 2} \).

Would you like me to proceed to step 3 and model the probing process as a geometric random variable?
Teacher: Great job adjusting the calculation! Now, let’s move on to step 3.

Recall our process is modeled by repeatedly probing until we hit an empty slot—a “success.” Since each probe is independent and the probability of success (hitting an empty slot) is p = (m – n)/(m – 2), we can model the number of probes until an empty slot is found as a geometric random variable.

For this step:
• Define a random variable X that represents the number of probes needed until you find an empty slot.
• Explain why X follows a geometric distribution.
• Write down the formula for the expected value of a geometric random variable in terms of p.
• Lastly, express the expected number of probes E[X] in terms of m and n.

Please work through these points and share your reasoning. (Remember, you only need to work on this step.)
Student: Thank you for your guidance! Let's work through step 3 and define the random variable \( X \) that represents the number of probes needed until we find an empty slot.

1. **Defining the Random Variable**:
   - Let \( X \) be the random variable that denotes the number of probes required to find an empty slot in the hash table. 

2. **Geometric Distribution**:
   - The random variable \( X \) follows a geometric distribution because we are performing a series of independent Bernoulli trials (each probe) until the first success (finding an empty slot). Each probe has the same probability \( p \) of success, which is the probability of hitting an empty slot.

3. **Expected Value of a Geometric Random Variable**:
   - The expected value \( E[X] \) of a geometric random variable, where \( p \) is the probability of success, is given by the formula:
     \[
     E[X] = \frac{1}{p}
     \]

4. **Expressing the Expected Number of Probes**:
   - From our previous calculations, we found that the probability of hitting an empty slot is:
     \[
     p = P(\text{empty}) = \frac{m - n}{m - 2}
     \]
   - Therefore, substituting this probability into the expected value formula, we have:
     \[
     E[X] = \frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{\frac{m - n}{m - 2}} = \frac{m - 2}{m - n}
     \]

In summary, the expected number of probes \( E[X] \) required to find an empty slot during the search for an element that is not in the table is:
\[
E[X] = \frac{m - 2}{m - n}
\]

Would you like me to proceed to step 4 and combine all the steps to finalize our answer?
Teacher: Excellent work on modeling the process with a geometric random variable. Now we move to step 4: combining our results to obtain the final answer.

To summarize:
• We have determined that in each probe the success probability is p = (m – n)/(m – 2) (with m – 2 being the total number of possible slots, as the hash function chooses from slots 2 to m – 1).
• Since the number of probes until the first success follows a geometric distribution, the expected number of probes, E[X], is 1/p.

Based on these points, could you please now combine your results to state your final expression (in terms of m and n) for E[X], the expected number of table slots examined during the search?
Student: Certainly! Let's combine the results we've derived throughout our steps to finalize the expression for the expected number of table slots examined during the search for an element that is not in the hash table.

1. **Probability of Hitting an Empty Slot**:
   We established that the probability \( p \) of finding an empty slot during a probe is:
   \[
   p = \frac{m - n}{m - 2}
   \]

2. **Expected Number of Probes**:
   Since the number of probes until we find an empty slot follows a geometric distribution, the expected number of probes \( E[X] \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   E[X] = \frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{\frac{m - n}{m - 2}} = \frac{m - 2}{m - n}
   \]

3. **Final Expression**:
   Therefore, the expected number of table slots examined during the search for an element that is not in the table is:
   \[
   E[X] = \frac{m - 2}{m - n}
   \]

This expression gives us the expected number of slots that will be examined in the search process, clearly articulated in terms of \( m \) (the size of the hash table) and \( n \) (the number of distinct elements already in the table). 

Thank you for guiding me through this problem! Is there anything else you would like to discuss or clarify?
Teacher: Great work! Your final expression for the expected number of table slots examined is:

E[X] = (m - 2)/(m - n)$
