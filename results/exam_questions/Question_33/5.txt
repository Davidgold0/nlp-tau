Question: We build a hashing table of size \( m \) using the open addressing method (i.e., all the elements are in the hashing table without using pointers). We use a randomly chosen hash function of the form \( h(k, i) \), where \( k \) is the key that we want to insert into the table, and \( i \) is the probe number. (This is the uniform probing method. The value returned by calling \( h(k, i) \) is a uniformly chosen integer between 2 and \( m-1 \), independent of the previous random selections). The table already contains \( n \) distinct elements. We now perform a search for an element that is not in the table. What is the expected number of table slots examined during the search? Provide as tight a non-asymptotic answer as possible.
Teacher: Let's begin by breaking down the problem into manageable steps. We are given:

• A hash table of size m with n distinct elements already inserted.  
• A search for an element that is not in the table uses open addressing with uniform probing; each probe returns a slot uniformly at random from the table (with slots chosen independently).  

To structure our approach, here are the steps we need to follow:

1. Determine the probability that any given slot (chosen uniformly at random) is empty.  
2. Recognize that because the probes are independent, the process follows a geometric distribution where each probe “succeeds” by finding an empty slot, and “fails” when it hits an occupied slot.  
3. Use the fact that the expected number of probes in a geometric distribution is 1 divided by the success probability.  
4. Substitute the probability you calculated in step 1 to obtain the expected number of table slots examined during the search.

Let’s start with the first step:

What is the probability that a slot is empty, given that there are n occupied slots in a table of size m? Please share your answer to this step.
Student: To determine the probability that a given slot is empty, we can use the information about the number of occupied slots and the total size of the hash table.

We know that:

- The size of the hash table is \( m \).
- There are \( n \) distinct elements already inserted, which means there are \( n \) occupied slots.

The probability that a specific slot is empty can be calculated as follows:

1. The number of empty slots is \( m - n \) (since there are \( m \) total slots and \( n \) are occupied).
2. The probability that a specific slot is empty is therefore the ratio of empty slots to the total number of slots.

So, the probability \( P(\text{empty}) \) that a given slot is empty is:

\[
P(\text{empty}) = \frac{m - n}{m}
\]

This means that for any randomly chosen slot, the chance that it is empty is \( \frac{m - n}{m} \).

Does this answer align with your understanding, teacher?
Teacher: Great! Your explanation is correct: the probability that a given slot is empty is (m – n)/m.

Now that we have this probability, the next step is to determine the expected number of table slots examined during a search for an element not in the table. Since each probe is independent and the probability of success (finding an empty slot) is (m – n)/m, we notice that the number of probes follows a geometric distribution. 

Recall that for a geometric distribution with success probability p, the expected number of trials (or probes in our case) is 1/p.

With p = (m – n)/m, can you now calculate the expected number of table slots examined (i.e., the expected number of probes)? Please show your reasoning and answer for this step.
Student: To calculate the expected number of table slots examined during the search, we can use the information about the geometric distribution that you provided.

We know that the expected number of trials (or probes) in a geometric distribution is given by:

\[
E(X) = \frac{1}{p}
\]

where \( p \) is the probability of success. In our case, the success is finding an empty slot, and we have already established that:

\[
p = P(\text{empty}) = \frac{m - n}{m}
\]

Now, substituting \( p \) into the expected value formula, we get:

\[
E(X) = \frac{1}{\frac{m - n}{m}} = \frac{m}{m - n}
\]

Thus, the expected number of table slots examined during the search for an element not in the table is:

\[
E(X) = \frac{m}{m - n}
\]

This means that on average, we expect to examine \( \frac{m}{m - n} \) slots during the search. 

Does this answer meet your expectations, teacher?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly computed the expected number of slots examined. Let's quickly review the steps:

1. We determined that the probability of finding an empty slot is (m – n)/m since there are m – n empty slots out of m total slots.
2. Recognizing that each probe is independent and follows a geometric distribution with a success probability of (m – n)/m, we used the formula for the expected number of probes (i.e., the expected number of trials) as 1/p.
3. Substituting p = (m – n)/m into the formula, you obtained the expected number of probes as m/(m – n).

Your reasoning and calculation are correct!

Using all the steps we've discussed, the final answer is: m/(m - n)$
