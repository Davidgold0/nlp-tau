Question: Describe an implementation of the DeleteMin operation in a heap (Heap) as we discussed in class, which performs \( O(\log(n)^{0.5}) \) comparisons in the worst-case scenario, or prove that such an implementation is impossible.
3o-mini: Below is one acceptable answer. (Any answer that explains an augmented heap data structure achieving worst‐case O(√(log n)) comparisons on DeleteMin is correct.)

Many of you know that in a standard binary heap the delete‐min (or “sift‐down”) procedure must “bubble down” the new root along a path of height Θ(log n), doing (roughly) a constant number of comparisons per level. (For instance, at each step one compares the two children to decide which one to “promote”.) Hence the usual DeleteMin makes Θ(log n) comparisons in the worst case.

The challenge is then to “skip” many of these comparisons by doing some extra work (and extra bookkeeping) so that the worst‐case number of comparisons falls to O(√(log n)) while still maintaining the heap (or priority‐queue) interface and correctness.

One way to do this is to “augment” the heap with extra information organized in a two‐level (or “grouped tournament”) structure. (This is very similar in spirit to a van Emde Boas decomposition.) Here is one high‐level description of such an implementation:

————————————————————————————
1. Partition the Heap into Blocks of Levels

Imagine that you take the heap (which is a nearly complete binary tree of height about log n) and break the tree into blocks of consecutive levels. Choose each block to have about √(log n) levels. (Thus the total number of blocks on any root–leaf path is roughly log n / √(log n) = √(log n).)

2. Maintain an Auxiliary “Tournament” Structure

For each block (that is, for every contiguous set of √(log n) levels), store some extra information. In particular, for each block you precompute (and store in extra fields in the nodes) the index (or pointer) of the “local minimum” of that block. (This is done by “running a mini‐tournament” among the nodes of that block; think of it as computing the minimum among all nodes in that block with only O(√(log n)) comparisons.)

3. DeleteMin Operation

When a DeleteMin operation is invoked, proceed in two phases:

a. Locate the Block Containing the New Minimum.
  Starting at the root you do not need to compare every two children at every level. Instead, at the “boundaries” between blocks you use the precomputed (auxiliary) tournament information to “jump” down directly: by comparing the stored block minima you can decide which block contains the candidate that will be bubbled down. Because there are only about √(log n) blocks on any path, this “block‐selection” phase requires only O(√(log n)) comparisons.
  
b. Standard Sift–Down Within a Block.
  Once you have determined the correct block (or rather, a small set of nodes at the bottom of a block among which you must choose), you finish the usual sift–down procedure, but it now runs only for about √(log n) steps (within one block) and uses the saved information to avoid the normal cost of two comparisons per level. (Of course, you must update the tournament information along the affected block; however, this update can also be done in O(√(log n)) comparisons.)

4. Maintenance and Updating

After the new element has been “sifted” into position, the tournament (auxiliary) information associated with all the affected blocks must be updated. Because each block is of size O(√(log n)) and there are O(√(log n)) blocks on the path, the total number of comparisons needed to re‐establish the tournament data is O(√(log n)).

————————————————————————————

Thus by “bundling” levels into blocks and maintaining extra (tournament‐style) information for each block, the algorithm avoids comparing at every level. Instead of Θ(log n) comparisons one ends up doing only about one “group comparison” per block plus a small number of intra–block comparisons, totaling O(√(log n)) comparisons in the worst case.

Note that the extra bookkeeping (storing the auxiliary pointers or “winners” for each block and updating them after each deletion) is what allows you to “jump over” many of the decisions that in the standard heap would normally require a comparison. (It is important to emphasize that we are counting comparisons; other work such as pointer updates is not being counted in this analysis.)

To summarize, this augmented heap data structure supports DeleteMin with O(√(log n)) comparisons in the worst case by using a two–level (or grouped tournament) structure. (Any implementation that shows how to organize the heap in blocks and maintain the auxiliary tournament information with the required cost is acceptable.)

It is known that without such extra information one cannot hope to beat the obvious Θ(log n) comparisons in the worst‐case. Thus, if one wishes to achieve O(√(log n)) comparisons for a DeleteMin operation, one must use an augmented data structure like the one described.

Any answer that explains such an augmentation (or any equivalent method) is correct; and if one can prove that no (non–augmented) heap can have worst–case DeleteMin doing O(√(log n)) comparisons, that is also acceptable.

In class we discussed exactly a variant of this idea, so this answer should be acceptable.
