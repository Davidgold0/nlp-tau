Question: \textit{Given a series of n elements, what is the time complexity for finding the k smallest elements in the series (for k < n).}
3o-mini: There are several methods to do this, and the overall complexity depends on which one you use and whether you need the k elements to be sorted.

1. Using a max‐heap of size k (when k < n):  
 • You iterate through all n elements, and for each element you may update the heap in O(log k) time.  
 • This gives a total time of O(n log k).

2. Using a selection algorithm (like Quickselect) to find the kth smallest element:  
 • Quickselect finds the kth smallest element on average in O(n) time.  
 • Once you have the kth smallest element, you can partition the array into elements less than or equal to it, giving you the k smallest (but not necessarily sorted).  
 • If you then need the k elements sorted, you’d sort them in O(k log k) time.  
 • Thus, the total average time is O(n + k log k).

So, if you only need the set of k smallest elements (not in sorted order), you can achieve an average time of O(n) using Quickselect. If you require them sorted, then O(n + k log k) is achievable. Alternatively, a max‐heap approach gives O(n log k) in the worst case.
