Question: Describe a data structure whose elements are pairs of keys \( (a, b) \), where each left key in the pair is an integer in the range \([1, 10n]\). It can be assumed that all the key pairs are distinct. The data structure should support the following operations (where \( n \) is the number of key pairs currently in the data structure):

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Insert(a, b)} – Adds the key pair \( (a, b) \) to the data structure. The operation should be performed in amortized time \( O(1) \).
    \item \texttt{IncreaseKey((a, b), x)} – This command receives a pointer to the key pair \( (a, b) \) that is in the data structure and a positive number \( x \), and increases the right key by \( x \). The operation should be performed in amortized time \( O(1) \).
    \item \texttt{Delete((a, b))} – This command receives a pointer to the key pair \( (a, b) \) that is in the data structure and deletes it. The operation should be performed in amortized time \( O(\log n) \).
\end{itemize}
3o-mini: We will show that one acceptable answer is to “layer” a Fibonacci heap on top of a direct–address table keyed by a. (Any data structure that gives the same asymptotic bounds is fine.) One solution is as follows.

Recall that the operations must work on key–pairs (a, b) with the restrictions that
  • a ∈ [1, 10n] 
  • all (a,b) “key–pairs” are distinct.
Also, note that we require

  Insert(a, b)  amortized O(1)
  IncreaseKey((a,b), x)  amortized O(1)
  Delete((a,b))  amortized O(log n)

The idea is to “index” the data by the left key, a, so that given a pair (a, b) we can immediately locate it in some auxiliary table. Then we store the information in a Fibonacci heap (actually, a max–Fibonacci heap) keyed by the right key b.

Why a max–Fibonacci heap? Although Fibonacci heaps are famous because they support DECREASE‐KEY in O(1) amortized time, note that our operation is IncreaseKey – i.e. we are increasing b. If you “reverse” the ordering – that is, if you maintain a max–heap instead of a min–heap – then increasing b is analogous to “decreasing” the key when using the standard (min–oriented) Fibonacci heap. (More precisely, with a max–Fibonacci heap the usual “decrease–key” operation becomes an “increase–key” operation.) Thus using a max–Fibonacci heap we get:
  • Insert is O(1) amortized.
  • IncreaseKey (done by performing a “decrease–key”–style cascading cut in the max–version) is O(1) amortized.
  • And deletion (which is done by “increasing” the key to +∞ or by other standard techniques, followed by an Extract–Max) is O(log n) amortized.

Now here is the suggested design:

1. Direct–Address Table for Left Keys:
  Because every a is in the range [1, 10n] (where n is the current number of key–pairs), we allocate an array (or direct–address table) T[1 … 10n]. When a new key–pair (a, b) is inserted, we store a pointer that will eventually refer to the node (that contains (a,b)) in the Fibonacci heap. (In case the keys a are not unique one would have to store a list in T[a]; however, the problem states that all key–pairs are distinct and the range is “small” compared to n; one acceptable assumption is that the left keys uniquely identify the key–pairs. Even if they are not unique, one can store the list of pointers in T[a] and update that list in O(1) time.) 

2. Fibonacci Heap (Max–oriented) for Right Keys:
  We now keep all the key–pairs (a, b) in a Fibonacci heap H that is ordered by b in descending order. (If you prefer you may think of “increasing b” as “improving” the node’s value in a max–heap.) The Fibonacci heap gives O(1) amortized time for insertion and the “decrease–key” analogue (here IncreaseKey) and O(log n) for deletion.

Operation details:

 • Insert(a, b):
  – Create a new node x that stores (a, b) (and possibly a pointer back to its location in T, though T is indexed by a anyway).
  – Insert x into the Fibonacci heap H. (This takes O(1) amortized time.)
  – Set T[a] = x.
  Thus the insertion takes O(1) amortized time.

 • IncreaseKey((a, b), x):
  – We are given a pointer to the node x (or we recover it immediately from T[a]) that stores (a, b).
  – Increase its b value by the given amount. (Since we are using a max–Fibonacci heap, increasing the key means that the node might now be “better” than its parent.)
  – In a Fibonacci heap this is handled by “cutting” the node and moving it to the root list if needed. (This is exactly analogous to the standard decrease–key procedure in a min–Fibonacci heap.) 
  Thus the IncreaseKey operation takes O(1) amortized time.

 • Delete((a, b)):
  – We are given a pointer to the node x (or we find it in T[a]).
  – To delete an arbitrary node in a Fibonacci heap, a standard trick is to increase its key to +∞ (or a value greater than any other key), which costs O(1) amortized (using the cascading–cut procedure) and then perform an Extract–Max, which takes O(log n) amortized time.
  – Finally, set T[a] to null (or remove x from the linked list stored at T[a] if multiple keys share the same a).
  Thus the deletion takes O(log n) amortized time.

Summary

By storing the elements in a direct–address table (indexed by the left key) for fast access and in a max–Fibonacci heap (ordered by the right key) for fast insertion, increase–key and deletion then we meet the requirements:
  • Insert in O(1) amortized time.
  • IncreaseKey in O(1) amortized time.
  • Delete in O(log n) amortized time.

Any answer that, perhaps with different details, achieves the stated bounds is correct.
