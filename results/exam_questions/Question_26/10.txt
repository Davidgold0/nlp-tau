Question: Given a collection of sets $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_m$.

Describe a data structure that supports the following operations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{MakeItem(i) $\gets$ A} – Create the item $A$ that holds the number $i$.
    \item \texttt{Insert(j, A)} – Insert the item $A$ into set $S_j$ (it is assumed that the set $S_j$ exists).
    \item \texttt{Delete(j, A)} – Delete the item $A$ from set $S_j$ (it is assumed that the set $S_j$ exists).
    \item \texttt{FindMin(j)} – Return the minimum item from set $S_j$ (it is assumed that the set $S_j$ exists).
    \item \texttt{CreateSet(j, Arr)} – Build the set $j$ from an unsorted array of numbers.
    \item \texttt{FindMin()} – Return the minimum item among all items in the sets $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_m$.
\end{itemize}

All operations, except for \texttt{CreateSet}, should run in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n$ is the total number of items in sets $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_m$. The \texttt{CreateSet} operation should run in linear time relative to the size of the input array.
3o-mini: We can solve the problem by “layering” two data structures. In one layer we have a data structure for each set S₁, S₂, …, Sₘ that supports fast insertion, deletion, and “find-min” on that particular set. In the other layer we have a global data structure that quickly finds the overall minimum among all the sets by “keeping track” of each set’s minimum.

One acceptable solution is to use a binary heap for each set and to maintain a global binary heap keyed by the minimum element in each set. (Other balanced structures—for example, Fibonacci heaps or balanced binary search trees augmented with a pointer to the left‐most node—are also acceptable provided that they meet the running time requirements.)

The details are as follows:

──────────────────────────────
1. The Local Data Structures

For each set Sⱼ we maintain a min–heap (or any balanced priority‐queue-like data structure) that stores the items in Sⱼ. In this heap:
 • Insertions and deletions run in O(log |Sⱼ|) time.
 • Finding the minimum in Sⱼ is immediate (at the root of the heap).

Note that:
 – The MakeItem(i) operation simply creates an item A with key i.
 – The Insert(j, A) operation inserts A into the heap for Sⱼ.
 – The Delete(j, A) operation deletes the item A from Sⱼ’s heap (given that we have a pointer to A’s location inside that heap, deletion can be done in O(log n) time).
 – The FindMin(j) operation returns the root of Sⱼ’s heap.

Also, the CreateSet(j, Arr) operation must take linear time in the length of the array Arr. This is achieved by “heapifying” the unsorted array Arr, which is well-known to run in O(n) time.

──────────────────────────────
2. The Global Data Structure

To support the global FindMin()—that is, to quickly obtain the minimum item among all sets—we maintain a global min–heap (or any balanced search tree keyed by the minimum values). For each set Sⱼ we keep an entry in this global heap that is keyed by the minimum element in Sⱼ. (We could simply store a pointer to the root of Sⱼ’s heap together with its key.)

With this setup:
 • Whenever an item is inserted or deleted from a set Sⱼ, we check whether the minimum of Sⱼ has changed. If it has, we update the corresponding entry in the global heap in O(log m) time (and note that m, the number of sets, is at most n, so O(log m) ⊆ O(log n)).
 • The FindMin() operation (with no parameter) returns the root of the global heap, which is the overall minimum among all sets.

──────────────────────────────
3. Operation Summary

• MakeItem(i) – Create an item A holding the key i. (O(1) operation.)

• Insert(j, A) – Insert the item A into set Sⱼ’s min–heap in O(log n) time. Then, if A becomes the new minimum for Sⱼ, update the corresponding entry in the global heap (also in O(log n) time).

• Delete(j, A) – Delete the item A from the min–heap for Sⱼ in O(log n) time, and if this removal changes Sⱼ’s minimum, update the global heap accordingly. (O(log n) time overall.)

• FindMin(j) – Return the minimum item from set Sⱼ by looking at the root of its min–heap. (O(1) time, assuming a pointer to the root, or O(log n) in some balanced tree implementations.)

• CreateSet(j, Arr) – Build the min–heap for Sⱼ using the heap–build (heapify) algorithm, which runs in linear time relative to the size of Arr. Then, add an entry for Sⱼ (with its minimum) into the global heap. (O(nₐ) time where nₐ = |Arr|.)

• FindMin() – Return the overall minimum by looking at the root of the global min–heap. (O(1) or O(log n) time depending on the details of the global heap, but it will be within O(log n).)

4. Final Remarks

This two–layer structure meets the requirements:

– Every operation (except CreateSet) runs in O(log n) time.
– The CreateSet operation runs in linear time relative to the size of the input array.
– We achieve global minimum queries by “bundling” each set’s minimum in a secondary data structure.

Any other implementation that achieves these asymptotic bounds (for example, using augmented balanced binary search trees for the individual sets) is acceptable.
