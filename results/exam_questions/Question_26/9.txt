Question: Given a collection of sets $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_m$.

Describe a data structure that supports the following operations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{MakeItem(i) $\gets$ A} – Create the item $A$ that holds the number $i$.
    \item \texttt{Insert(j, A)} – Insert the item $A$ into set $S_j$ (it is assumed that the set $S_j$ exists).
    \item \texttt{Delete(j, A)} – Delete the item $A$ from set $S_j$ (it is assumed that the set $S_j$ exists).
    \item \texttt{FindMin(j)} – Return the minimum item from set $S_j$ (it is assumed that the set $S_j$ exists).
    \item \texttt{CreateSet(j, Arr)} – Build the set $j$ from an unsorted array of numbers.
    \item \texttt{FindMin()} – Return the minimum item among all items in the sets $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_m$.
\end{itemize}

All operations, except for \texttt{CreateSet}, should run in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n$ is the total number of items in sets $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_m$. The \texttt{CreateSet} operation should run in linear time relative to the size of the input array.
3o-mini: We can solve the problem by “nesting” heaps. In other words, we use a heap for each set (so that we can support CreateSet in linear time with a standard heapify, and support Insert, Delete, and FindMin in logarithmic time) and then keep an auxiliary heap that stores the minimum element from each set (so that we can answer a global FindMin quickly). One acceptable design is as follows.

Outline of the Data Structure

1. For each set S₁, S₂, …, Sₘ, maintain a min‐heap. (A binary heap is a natural choice.)  
   • Represent the heap in an array.  
   • Each item in the heap is an object (created by MakeItem(i)) that holds the number i and, importantly, a pointer (or index) showing its location in the heap. Using this pointer you can delete an arbitrary item in O(log n) time (by “bubbling” it up or down as needed).

2. Also maintain a “global” min‐heap T that consists of one element from each set: specifically, the minimum element (i.e. the root) of each non‐empty set’s heap.  
   • An entry in T is a pair (key, j) where key is the current minimum in set Sⱼ and j is the index of the set.  
   • When the minimum item of any set changes (because of an insertion or deletion), we update the corresponding entry in T (by performing an update or deletion then insertion, which takes O(log m) time; note that m ≤ n so this is O(log n) time).

────────────────────────
How Each Operation Works

1. MakeItem(i) ← A  
   • Allocate an item object A whose key equals i.  
   • (This simply creates an object; since the operation does not need to place the item inside any heap at creation, it is O(1).)

2. Insert(j, A)  
   • Add item A to the heap for set Sⱼ using the standard heap insertion procedure.  
   • This runs in O(log |Sⱼ|) time (which is O(log n) in the worst‐case).  
   • If A’s key is less than the current minimum of Sⱼ (or if Sⱼ was empty), update the global heap T with the new minimum for set j. (This update can be done by reheapifying the entry for j in T in O(log(m)) = O(log n) time.)

3. Delete(j, A)  
   • Given a pointer/index from A (stored in the item itself), remove A from the binary heap for Sⱼ in O(log n) time (adjusting the heap by “bubbling” up or down).  
   • If A was the minimum element in Sⱼ then after deletion the new root becomes the minimum, and you update the corresponding entry in T accordingly (again in O(log n) time).

4. FindMin(j)  
   • Return the root of the heap for Sⱼ. Since the root of a heap is stored in the first position of the array, this operation can be done in O(1) time (and even if you consider the cost to check pointer updates it remains O(log n) in the worst-case).

5. CreateSet(j, Arr)  
   • Given the unsorted array Arr of numbers, build the binary heap for set Sⱼ using the “heapify” procedure.  
   • This procedure runs in linear time relative to the size of Arr.  
   • Once the heap is built, insert the minimum element (the root) into the global heap T for set j (an O(log n) operation, which is acceptable since there is only one such element per set).

6. FindMin() (global)  
   • This operation simply returns the minimum key from the global heap T, which is the smallest among the minima of all sets.  
   • Since T is itself a heap, this can be done in O(1) (or O(log n) if you must adjust it, but typically you just peek at the root).

────────────────────────
Complexity Verification

• All of the operations except CreateSet run in O(log n) time.  
• Creating a set from an unsorted array is done in linear time in the array’s size using the standard heapify algorithm.

────────────────────────
Conclusion

This data structure – consisting of a heap per set and a global minimum heap – meets the requirements:

• MakeItem, Insert, Delete, FindMin(j), and global FindMin all run in O(log n) time.
• CreateSet runs in linear time relative to the size of the input array.

There are other solutions (for example, using a balanced binary search tree for each set and augmenting a global search structure), but the heap-based solution is natural here because it allows us to “heapify” an unsorted array in linear time while still supporting logarithmic insertions and deletions.
