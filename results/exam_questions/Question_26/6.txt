Question: Given a collection of sets $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_m$.

Describe a data structure that supports the following operations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{MakeItem(i) $\gets$ A} – Create the item $A$ that holds the number $i$.
    \item \texttt{Insert(j, A)} – Insert the item $A$ into set $S_j$ (it is assumed that the set $S_j$ exists).
    \item \texttt{Delete(j, A)} – Delete the item $A$ from set $S_j$ (it is assumed that the set $S_j$ exists).
    \item \texttt{FindMin(j)} – Return the minimum item from set $S_j$ (it is assumed that the set $S_j$ exists).
    \item \texttt{CreateSet(j, Arr)} – Build the set $j$ from an unsorted array of numbers.
    \item \texttt{FindMin()} – Return the minimum item among all items in the sets $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_m$.
\end{itemize}

All operations, except for \texttt{CreateSet}, should run in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n$ is the total number of items in sets $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_m$. The \texttt{CreateSet} operation should run in linear time relative to the size of the input array.
3o-mini: We can solve the problem by “layering” two kinds of data structures. One data structure will be used for each set S₁, S₂, …, Sₘ and one will “summarize” the overall minimum among the sets. One very natural solution is to use heaps.

Below is one way to describe the answer.

───────────────────────────── 
1. Represent each set Sⱼ by a binary heap (or any heap‐structure that supports the following):
 • Insertion in O(log n) time,
 • Deletion of an arbitrary item (provided you have a pointer into the heap) in O(log n) time, and 
 • FindMin (i.e. returning the minimum element) in O(1) time.
 
Notice that when you “create” a set Sⱼ from an unsorted array Arr, you can build a binary heap in linear time by using the standard build-heap algorithm.

Each item A is created via MakeItem(i) and stored with a key (its number) and (if necessary) a pointer to its position in its heap so that deletion can be done in O(logn).

───────────────────────────── 
2. To support the global FindMin (i.e. “among all items in S₁, S₂, …, Sₘ”), we maintain a second structure—a global “min‐heap” (or more generally any ordered dictionary) whose elements are the “local minima” of the various sets. In particular, for each set Sⱼ that is non‐empty we store an entry (j, v) where v is the minimum value in Sⱼ (which is simply the root of Sⱼ’s heap). Since there are at most m such entries, all operations on this global min–heap run in O(log m) time, and because m ≤ n, we get O(log n).

Whenever an Insert or Delete operation is performed on any set Sⱼ, if that operation changes the minimum element of Sⱼ, then we update (or reinsert) the corresponding entry in the global min–heap. (If the set becomes empty, we remove its entry from the global heap.)

───────────────────────────── 
3. Details of the operations

• MakeItem(i) → A
  Simply create an object A holding the key i (and possibly a pointer that will later be used to know its position within a heap).

• Insert(j, A)
  Insert A into the binary heap representing set Sⱼ. This takes O(log|Sⱼ|) ≤ O(log n) time. Then, if A is less than the current minimum of Sⱼ (i.e. it becomes the new heap root) update the global min–heap (which takes O(log m) = O(log n) time).

• Delete(j, A)
  Using the pointer stored in A (or another handle for that purpose), remove A from the heap representing Sⱼ in O(log|Sⱼ|) time. If this deletion changes the minimum element in Sⱼ then update the global heap accordingly.

• FindMin(j)
  Return the root of the binary heap that represents Sⱼ. Since the root is stored at a fixed place, this takes O(1) time (or O(log n) if some pointer update is needed, but even in the worst case it is within our allowed time).

• CreateSet(j, Arr)
  Given an unsorted array Arr, use the build-heap algorithm to construct the binary heap representing set Sⱼ in O(|Arr|) time. Also, update the global min–heap by adding the entry (j, min(Arr)) (which takes O(log m) time).

• FindMin()
  Return the minimum entry from the global min–heap, which is the minimum among all current set-minimums. This is O(1) time (or O(log m) if a deletion or insertion in the global heap is needed as part of the update).

───────────────────────────── 
4. Time Complexities

All operations (besides CreateSet) will take O(log n) time, where n is the total number of items in all sets. The CreateSet operation takes time linear in the size of the input array (plus a very small overhead to update the global structure).

───────────────────────────── 
Conclusion

By using a binary heap for each set (allowing O(log n) insertion and deletion and O(1) find-min, with linear build-time from an unsorted array) and by maintaining a second “global” min–heap which keeps track of each set’s minimum, we achieve the following:
 • MakeItem, Insert, Delete, and FindMin(j) run in O(log n) time,
 • CreateSet runs in linear time relative to the input array’s length, and
 • FindMin() (global minimum) runs in O(1) (or O(log n) worst-case if you count the update operations) time.

This data structure meets all the requirements posed by the problem.
