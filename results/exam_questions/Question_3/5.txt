Question: Given two arrays \( A \) and \( B \), each of size \( n \), we want to create a third array \( C \) of size \( n \), with the following property:  
The value stored in \( C[i] \) is the number of elements in \( A \) that are smaller than \( B[i] \).  

Describe an algorithm with the best worst-case time complexity to solve this problem.
Teacher: Let's start by rephrasing the problem in our own words: 

We have two arrays, A and B, each containing n elements. We need to create a new array C such that for every index i, C[i] is the number of elements in A that are strictly less than B[i].

One effective strategy to do this is:

1. Sort array A.
2. For each element B[i] in B, perform a binary search on the sorted array A to determine how many elements are smaller than B[i]. This count will then be stored in C[i].

Now, let's take the first step: sorting array A.

Please tell me, what is the worst-case time complexity for sorting an array of size n, and what sorting algorithm would give us that performance?
Student: The worst-case time complexity for sorting an array of size \( n \) using a comparison-based sorting algorithm, such as Merge Sort or Heap Sort, is \( O(n \log n) \). Both of these algorithms have this performance in the worst case due to their divide-and-conquer approach, where the array is repeatedly divided into smaller subarrays and then merged or organized.

So, if we use Merge Sort to sort array \( A \), it will take \( O(n \log n) \) time in the worst case.
Teacher: Great job on your response! You correctly identified that sorting array A using Merge Sort takes O(n log n) time in the worst case.

Now, let’s move on to the next step of the algorithm. We now have array A sorted. For each element B[i] in array B, we need to determine how many elements in sorted array A are smaller than B[i]. To do this efficiently, we plan to use binary search.

Can you now explain what the worst-case time complexity is for performing binary search on a sorted array of size n? And then, based on that, what would be the overall time complexity if you perform binary search for each element in array B (which also contains n elements)?

Take your time and let me know your thoughts on this next step.
Student: Student: The worst-case time complexity for performing binary search on a sorted array of size \( n \) is \( O(\log n) \). This is because binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, which leads to a logarithmic number of comparisons.

Since we have \( n \) elements in array \( B \) and we will perform a binary search for each element \( B[i] \) in the sorted array \( A \), the overall time complexity for this step would be \( O(n \log n) \). 

This is because we are doing \( n \) binary searches, each taking \( O(\log n) \) time. Therefore, the total time complexity for searching for all elements in \( B \) would be \( n \cdot O(\log n) = O(n \log n) \).

So, combining both steps, the overall time complexity for the entire algorithm would be:

1. Sorting array \( A \): \( O(n \log n) \)
2. Performing binary search for each element in \( B \): \( O(n \log n) \)

Thus, the total time complexity remains \( O(n \log n) \).
Teacher: You've done an excellent job detailing the binary search step and its contribution to the overall time complexity. Now, let's move on to the next step.

For the next step, please summarize the complete algorithm you would use to solve the problem. Be sure to include these key points:

1. How you sort array A along with its time complexity.
2. How you use binary search on the sorted array A for each element in array B, and its time complexity.
3. How these steps combine to give the overall worst-case time complexity.

Please provide your summary of the complete algorithm along with the final overall time complexity.
Student: Sure! Here’s a summary of the complete algorithm to solve the problem of creating array \( C \) such that each element \( C[i] \) represents the number of elements in array \( A \) that are smaller than \( B[i] \):

1. **Sort Array A**: 
   - We begin by sorting array \( A \) using Merge Sort (or any \( O(n \log n) \) comparison-based sorting algorithm). 
   - **Time Complexity**: This step takes \( O(n \log n) \) time.

2. **Binary Search for Each Element in B**:
   - For each element \( B[i] \) in array \( B \), we perform a binary search on the sorted array \( A \) to find the index of the first element that is not less than \( B[i] \). This index also represents the count of elements in \( A \) that are smaller than \( B[i] \), which is stored in \( C[i] \).
   - **Time Complexity**: The binary search for each element in \( B \) takes \( O(\log n) \) time, and since we perform this search for all \( n \) elements in \( B \), this step takes \( O(n \log n) \) time in total.

3. **Overall Time Complexity**: 
   - Combining both steps, we have:
     - Sorting array \( A \): \( O(n \log n) \)
     - Performing binary search for each element in \( B \): \( O(n \log n) \)
   - Therefore, the total overall time complexity for the entire algorithm is:
     \[
     O(n \log n) + O(n \log n) = O(n \log n)
     \]

In conclusion, the complete algorithm efficiently computes the desired array \( C \) with an overall worst-case time complexity of \( O(n \log n) \).
Teacher: You've provided a thorough and clear summary! You've correctly outlined that:

1. We sort array A using an O(n log n) algorithm (like Merge Sort).
2. For each element in array B, we use binary search on the sorted A (taking O(log n) per search), resulting in a total of O(n log n) for this step.
3. Combining both steps, the overall worst-case complexity is O(n log n).

Great work! The final answer is O(n log n)$
