Question: Describe a data structure whose elements are pairs of keys \( (a, b) \) that supports the following operations (where \( n \) is the number of key pairs currently in the data structure, and it can be assumed that all the key pairs are distinct):

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Insert(a, b)} – Adds the key pair \( (a, b) \) to the data structure. The operation should be performed in \( O(\log n) \) time.
    \item \texttt{Delete(a, b)} – Deletes the key pair \( (a, b) \). The operation should be performed in \( O(\log n) \) time.
    \item \texttt{Search(a, b)} – Returns the key pair \( (a, b) \) if it exists, otherwise returns null. The operation should be performed in \( O(\log n) \) time.
    \item \texttt{successor(a, b)} – Returns \( (a, b^*) \) where \( b^* \) is defined as follows: let \( b_1, b_2, b_3, \dots, b_m \) be all the keys such that the pair \( (a, b_i) \) exists in the data structure (for \( 1 \leq i \leq m \)) and is sorted in ascending order. Then, \( b^* \) is the key to the right of \( b \) in the sorted list. If there is no key to the right of \( b \) in the sorted list, return null. The operation should be performed in \( O(\log n) \) time.
\end{itemize}
3o-mini: We can design such a data structure by “splitting” the two keys across two levels. One very natural solution is to use an outer balanced binary search tree (such as a red–black tree or AVL tree) keyed on a, where each node stores an inner balanced search tree (again, red–black tree, AVL tree, etc.) holding all b‐values associated with that specific a.

Below is a description of how the structure works and how each operation is implemented:

────────────────────────────–
Structure

1. Outer Tree (by a):
   • Each node in this tree uses the a‑value as its key.
   • Each node also has an associated pointer to an inner tree that stores all b‑values for which the key pair (a, b) is in the data structure.
   • The outer tree is balanced so that any search, insert, or delete on it takes O(log k) time where k is the number of distinct a‑values (and note that k ≤ n).

2. Inner Tree (by b):
   • In any node of the outer tree, the associated inner tree is itself a balanced BST storing b‑values sorted in ascending order.
   • Operations on this tree (insert, delete, search, predecessor, or successor queries) run in O(log m) time where m is the number of b‑values associated with that particular a (and m ≤ n).

────────────────────────────–
Operations

1. Insert(a, b):
   • Lookup a in the outer tree: O(log k) ⊆ O(log n).
     – If the key a is not found, create a new inner tree for it.
   • Insert b into the inner tree for a: O(log m) ⊆ O(log n).
   • Overall, the insertion is done in O(log n) time.

2. Delete(a, b):
   • Locate the node for a in the outer tree: O(log n).
   • Delete b from the inner tree: O(log n) in the worst case.
   • (Optional) If after deletion the inner tree becomes empty, remove the node for a from the outer tree.
   • Overall, the deletion is done in O(log n) time.

3. Search(a, b):
   • Locate the node for a in the outer tree: O(log n).
   • Search for b in the inner tree: O(log n).
   • Overall, the search is done in O(log n) time.

4. successor(a, b):
   • First, locate the outer node for a (O(log n)).
   • Then, in the inner tree of a, perform a successor operation on the key b. In more detail:
     – Find the node for b in the inner tree.
     – Determine the key immediately greater than b in that inner BST (this is a standard BST operation that runs in O(log n)).
     – If such a b exists, return the pair (a, b*); otherwise, return null.
   • Overall, the successor operation is performed in O(log n) time.

────────────────────────────–
Why This Works

Because both the outer and inner trees are balanced:
   - The outer search (by a) always takes O(log n) time (since in the worst case, the number of distinct a‑values is O(n)).
   - The inner search (by b) is executed on a tree of size at most n, so it is also O(log n).
Thus, every operation meets the O(log n) requirement.

────────────────────────────–
Alternative Approaches

One might consider using a single balanced BST keyed by the composite key (a, b) (for example, using lexicographical order). However, the successor operation as defined here is not simply “the next pair in lex order” — it must be the next b value for the same a. While you could locate (a, b) and then check if the found successor has the same a, such an approach can complicate the implementation and does not naturally guarantee O(log n) time for the constrained “successor” operation.

────────────────────────────–
Conclusion

A two-level data structure (i.e., a balanced BST for a that stores balanced BSTs for b) is a clean, efficient solution that meets all the requirements:

• Insert(a, b) in O(log n) time.
• Delete(a, b) in O(log n) time.
• Search(a, b) in O(log n) time.
• successor(a, b) in O(log n) time.

This implementation elegantly handles the “grouping” by a, while maintaining efficient operations on the b‑values for each given a.
