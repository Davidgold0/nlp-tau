Question: \textit{We insert into a binomial heap (initially empty) the sequence of numbers 1, 2, \ldots, n in ascending order. For two binomial trees in the heap created, with ranks i, j such that i < j, what is the relation between all the values in the tree of rank i and all the values in the tree of rank j? Explain.}
3o-mini: Recall that in a binomial heap, each tree is a binomial tree that obeys the heap property (every parent is less than or equal to its children) and the trees have ranks (or orders) that indicate their structure. When you insert the numbers 1, 2, …, n in ascending order into an initially empty binomial heap, the way the trees are merged (when two trees of the same rank are encountered, they are linked together by making the tree with the smaller root the new parent) ensures a very interesting property.

Specifically, consider two trees in the heap with ranks i and j where i < j. Because of the way linking works:
 • When two trees of the same rank are merged, the one with the smaller root becomes the parent.
 • Also, when inserting in ascending order, the smaller numbers are inserted earlier. This means that trees of lower rank are formed from earlier (and thus smaller) numbers, while trees of higher rank result only after a series of merges that eventually incorporate later (and hence larger) numbers.
 • Moreover, during each linking operation, since the smaller value is always chosen as the root, the entire collection of values in the lower-ranked tree ends up being less than every value in the other tree to which it is linked later on.

Therefore, every value in the tree of rank i is less than every value in the tree of rank j (with i < j). In other words, if x is any element in the binomial tree of rank i and y is any element in the binomial tree of rank j, then x < y.

This relationship holds as a consequence of both the order of insertions and the linking rule used in binomial heaps.
