Question: Is it possible to implement any search tree such that the insert operation takes \( O(1) \) in the worst case and the delete operation takes \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the tree?
3o-mini: A “proper” search tree is generally expected to support efficient search (for example, in O(log n) time) by maintaining an ordering invariant. In order to insert a new key into such a tree, one must first locate the correct position for it by comparing it with previously stored keys. Even in a perfectly balanced tree the height is Ω(log n), so simply finding the insertion point takes Ω(log n) time.

One might “cheat” by using a trivial or degenerate data structure. For example, if you ignore the usual requirement that search be fast you could represent your set as an unsorted linked list. In that case you can insert a new element in O(1) time (e.g. at the head of the list) and you can delete an element (once you’ve searched for it) in O(n) time. However, this structure is not really a “search tree” in the customary sense because searches would also take O(n) time.

Thus, if you wish to maintain the ordered structure that gives you fast search times, you cannot have worst‐case O(1) insertions. (Of course, if you already know the exact node after which to insert, then the pointer adjustments can be done in constant time—but finding that node is the work that takes at least Ω(log n) time in a balanced tree.)

In summary, while there exist trivial data structures with O(1) insertion and O(n) deletion, no standard search tree that supports fast searches can achieve worst‐case O(1) insertion.
