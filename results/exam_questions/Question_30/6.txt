Question: Is it possible to implement any search tree such that the insert operation takes \( O(1) \) in the worst case and the delete operation takes \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the tree?
3o-mini: It is possible—but only by “cheating” one of the usual assumptions. In a typical search tree the insert operation must first locate the proper place (by comparing keys) and then splice in the new node. That search takes at least Ω(log n) time in a balanced tree (and up to Ω(n) in a degenerate one), so if you include the search the insertion can’t be O(1) worst‐case.

However, if you design the data structure so that the insert operation receives a pointer to the correct insertion point (or otherwise “knows” where to attach the new node), then the act of splicing in the node (i.e. updating a few pointers) can indeed be done in O(1) worst‐case time. (You might also, for example, maintain an unsorted linked list that happens also to satisfy the “search tree” invariant in a trivial way—even though searching that structure would be very slow.) Meanwhile, you could design the delete operation to “fix up” the structure in an expensive way—taking O(n) worst‐case time.

In summary, yes, one can implement a structure that supports the abstract operations of a search tree in which the actual pointer‐update work done by insertion is O(1) worst‐case and deletion takes O(n) worst‐case; but note that this only works if you assume that the location to insert is already known (or if you trade off efficiency in search). In any “real” search tree where the key must be located via comparisons as part of insertion, you cannot avoid the search cost, which is why the standard balanced trees have O(log n) worst‐case insertion.
