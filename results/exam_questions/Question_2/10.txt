Question: Given an array \( A \) containing \( n \) integers.  
Given a number \( x \) that appears in \( A \), we define the multiplicity of \( x \) in array \( A \) as the number of times \( x \) appears in \( A \).  
We want to create a sorted array \( B \) of size \( n \), which will contain the multiplicity of each number appearing in \( A \).  

Propose an algorithm that solves the problem with the best expected time complexity.  
3o-mini: We can solve the problem in expected O(n) time. One way to do this is to use a hash table in the first pass to count the frequency (or multiplicity) of each number, then create an array B that contains the frequency of each element in A, and finally sort B using counting sort (since the frequencies are integers in the range 1 to n).

Here’s an outline of the algorithm:

Step 1. Count Frequencies
  • Create an empty hash table (or dictionary) called frequency.
  • For each element x in A:
    – If x is not in frequency, set frequency[x] = 1.
    – Otherwise, increment frequency[x].

This step takes O(n) expected time.

Step 2. Build Array B
  • Create a new array B of size n.
  • For each index i (0 ≤ i < n), set B[i] = frequency[A[i]].  
    (This means we are “mapping” the original element to its multiplicity.)
This step takes O(n) time.

Step 3. Sort Array B
  • The values in B are counts that range from 1 to n. Use counting sort (or bucket sort) to sort B.  
  • Counting sort runs in O(n + k) time. In our case k = n, so this step is O(n).

Overall, the expected time complexity is O(n) since all steps are linear.

Pseudocode Illustration:

  function createSortedMultiplicityArray(A):
    n = length(A)
    frequency = new empty hash table
    // Count frequencies
    for each x in A do:
      if x is not in frequency then:
        frequency[x] = 1
      else:
        frequency[x] = frequency[x] + 1
    
    B = new array of size n
    // Build multiplicity array B
    for i = 0 to n-1 do:
      B[i] = frequency[A[i]]
    
    // Sort B using counting sort because B[i] ∈ {1, 2, ..., n}
    B_sorted = countingSort(B)  // O(n) time, assuming the numbers are in a small range
    return B_sorted

This algorithm meets the goal with the best expected time complexity.
