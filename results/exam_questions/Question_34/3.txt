Question: We build a hashing table of size \( m \) using the linear probing method. The keys of the elements inserted into the table are taken from the set \( \{0, 1, \dots, 2m-1\} \). We use the following hash function:
\[
h(k) = \left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor.
\]
We insert the elements \( 1, 2, \dots, m \) into the table in increasing order. How much time does it take to insert all the elements into the table using the standard insertion algorithm? Provide an asymptotic bound.
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem into manageable steps. Here’s one way to approach it:

1. Restate the situation in your own words. We have a table of size m. We insert m keys (1, 2, …, m) into it using linear probing. The hash function is h(k) = ⌊k/2⌋, so note that many keys (in fact, consecutive ones) may hash to the same value.

2. Notice that for keys beyond 1, many of them come in pairs that share the same hash value (for example, keys 2 and 3 both hash to 1; keys 4 and 5 both hash to 2; and so on). It will be important to analyze what happens when you try to insert these “paired” items into the table. What is the cost (in terms of probe steps) to insert a key if the initial hashed bucket is already occupied?

3. Use that analysis to set up the overall insertion cost. That is, think about the cost of inserting the first element of a pair versus its partner that causes a collision and requires probing.

Now, please address the first step: Examine what happens when you try to insert one of the paired keys using linear probing. Specifically, explain what the insertion process would look like for a key whose hash slot is already occupied. What additional step (or more) is needed, and how would that cost accumulate? Please share your thoughts on that step.
Student: Sure! Let me restate the situation in my own words and then analyze the insertion process for the paired keys.

We have a hash table of size \( m \) and we are inserting \( m \) keys, specifically the integers \( 1, 2, \ldots, m \), into the table using a hash function defined as \( h(k) = \left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor \). This means that each key will hash to a value that is half of the key, rounded down. 

Given this hash function, we notice that many keys will hash to the same value. For instance:
- Key \( 1 \) hashes to \( 0 \)
- Keys \( 2 \) and \( 3 \) both hash to \( 1 \)
- Keys \( 4 \) and \( 5 \) both hash to \( 2 \)
- Keys \( 6 \) and \( 7 \) both hash to \( 3 \)
- And so on...

This indicates that for every pair of consecutive keys starting from \( 2 \), they will collide when trying to insert them into the hash table, as they will hash to the same slot. 

Now, let's analyze what happens when we try to insert one of these paired keys, say key \( 2 \), which hashes to slot \( 1 \). 

1. When we insert key \( 2 \), it will go into slot \( 1 \) without any issues since it is empty.
2. Next, when we try to insert key \( 3 \), it will also hash to slot \( 1 \) but that slot is now occupied by key \( 2 \).
3. Since we are using linear probing, we will check the next slot (slot \( 2 \)). If it’s empty, key \( 3 \) will be inserted there. If slot \( 2 \) were also occupied, we would continue checking the next slots until we find an empty one.

The cost of inserting key \( 2 \) is \( 1 \) probe (direct insertion), while the cost of inserting key \( 3 \) is \( 2 \) probes (one for the original hash slot and one for the next available slot). 

This pattern continues for every pair of keys, where the first key of the pair takes \( 1 \) probe, and the second key takes \( 2 \) probes. 

To summarize the cost for inserting keys:
- For keys \( 1 \): \( 1 \) probe.
- For each pair \( (2, 3), (4, 5), \ldots, (m-1, m) \):
  - First key of the pair: \( 1 \) probe.
  - Second key of the pair: \( 2 \) probes.

So, if there are \( m \) keys, we have:
- \( 1 \) probe for key \( 1 \)
- \( m-1 \) pairs of keys, each contributing \( 1 + 2 = 3 \) probes.

Thus, the total cost becomes:
\[
1 + 3 \cdot \frac{m-1}{2} = 1 + \frac{3(m-1)}{2}.
\]

Now, let’s simplify this to find an asymptotic bound. As \( m \) grows large, the dominant term is:
\[
\frac{3m}{2} \implies O(m).
\]

So, the total time to insert all the elements into the table using the standard insertion algorithm is \( O(m) \). 

Does this analysis align with your expectations, or is there anything you would like me to clarify further?
Teacher: Your explanation was very detailed, and I appreciate how you restated the situation and described the process for a key that finds its hashed position occupied. However, I’d like to guide you through a careful re-examination of the probing costs.

Take a close look at the pattern as keys are inserted one after the other. For instance, after inserting key 1 and key 2 correctly, you mentioned that key 3 takes 2 probes (which is right). Now, before continuing with the “pair” idea that every first key takes 1 probe and its successor 2 probes, let’s examine what happens next.

Consider when you insert key 4: Its hash value is h(4) = 2. Is it guaranteed that slot 2 is free at that moment? Think about the state of the table after inserting keys 1, 2, and 3. How many of the slots up to slot 2 are already filled? Reexamine the sequence:
 • Key 1 goes into slot 0.
 • Key 2 goes into slot 1.
 • Key 3, with h(3)=1, finds slot 1 occupied and then takes slot 2.
Now, what happens when key 4 (with h(4) = 2) is to be inserted? Give it some thought: Which slot will it first target, and is that slot occupied?

Please focus on just this next step. What is the first target slot for key 4, and what happens if that slot is already occupied? Explain the probing sequence for key 4 in detail.
Student: Sure! Let's carefully analyze the insertion process for key \( 4 \) and see what happens step by step.

1. **Hash Function**: The hash function we are using is \( h(k) = \left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor \). For key \( 4 \), we calculate:
   \[
   h(4) = \left\lfloor \frac{4}{2} \right\rfloor = 2.
   \]
   So, the first target slot for key \( 4 \) is slot \( 2 \).

2. **Current State of the Table**: Before we insert key \( 4 \), let’s recap the state of the hash table after inserting keys \( 1, 2, \) and \( 3 \):
   - Key \( 1 \) goes into slot \( 0 \).
   - Key \( 2 \) goes into slot \( 1 \).
   - Key \( 3 \) hashes to \( 1 \) (which is occupied by key \( 2 \)), so it moves to slot \( 2 \) (which is free) and gets inserted there.

   After inserting these keys, the state of the table is:
   - Slot \( 0 \): Key \( 1 \)
   - Slot \( 1 \): Key \( 2 \)
   - Slot \( 2 \): Key \( 3 \)
   - Slot \( 3 \): (empty)

3. **Insertion of Key \( 4 \)**: Now, when we try to insert key \( 4 \):
   - We check slot \( 2 \) (the first target slot for key \( 4 \)), but it is already occupied by key \( 3 \).
   - Since we are using linear probing, we will proceed to the next slot, which is slot \( 3 \).

4. **Probing Sequence for Key \( 4 \)**:
   - First probe: Check slot \( 2 \) (occupied by key \( 3 \)).
   - Second probe: Check slot \( 3 \) (which is empty).

   Since slot \( 3 \) is empty, key \( 4 \) is successfully inserted into slot \( 3 \).

5. **Cost of Insertion for Key \( 4 \)**: The cost of inserting key \( 4 \) involves:
   - 1 probe to check slot \( 2 \) (occupied).
   - 1 additional probe to check slot \( 3 \) (empty).

Thus, the total cost for inserting key \( 4 \) is \( 2 \) probes.

This pattern continues for subsequent keys. Each key will either find its target slot occupied, requiring additional probes, or will find an empty slot. 

Would you like me to continue analyzing the costs for additional keys, or is there another aspect of the problem you'd like to explore?
Teacher: Great job analyzing key 4’s insertion in detail! Now, let’s move on to the next step: understanding the overall cost for inserting all m keys. Based on the pattern we’ve observed so far, consider the following:

1. Examine how the collisions accumulate—for example, after inserting keys 1 to 4, slots 0, 1, 2, and 3 have been occupied in a way that sometimes the key’s hashed slot is already taken, leading to additional probes.  
2. Try to develop a summation or an expression that accounts for the number of probes required for each key insertion as the table gets filled.  
3. Finally, simplify that expression to come up with an asymptotic bound (Big-O notation) for the total insertion process.

As your next step, please outline your plan or write an expression that sums up the probe cost for all keys from 1 to m. What does that summation look like, and how would you simplify it?
Student: Sure! Let's outline the plan to analyze the overall cost of inserting all \( m \) keys and derive a summation based on our observations about the insertion process.

### Analysis of Probing Costs

1. **Understanding Probes for Each Key**:
   - As we insert keys \( 1, 2, \ldots, m \) into the hash table, we know that the first key, \( 1 \), takes \( 1 \) probe since it directly goes into slot \( 0 \).
   - The second key, \( 2 \), takes \( 1 \) probe as well, since it goes into slot \( 1 \).
   - The third key, \( 3 \), takes \( 2 \) probes (one for slot \( 1 \) and another for slot \( 2 \)).
   - The fourth key, \( 4 \), takes \( 2 \) probes (one for slot \( 2 \) and another for slot \( 3 \)).
   - Continuing this pattern, we can see that every time we insert a key that hashes to an already occupied slot, the insertion will require additional probing.

2. **Pattern of Probes**:
   - For the first key \( 1 \): \( 1 \) probe.
   - For the second key \( 2 \): \( 1 \) probe.
   - For each subsequent key \( k \) (where \( k \) is odd, \( k = 2i + 1 \)), it will take \( 2 \) probes (one for the occupied slot and one for the next).
   - For each key \( k \) (where \( k \) is even, \( k = 2i \)), it will take \( 1 \) probe.

3. **Summation of Probes**:
   - Keys \( 1 \) and \( 2 \) contribute \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) probes.
   - For every pair \( (2i, 2i + 1) \) where \( i \) ranges from \( 1 \) to \( \frac{m}{2} - 1 \), each pair contributes \( 1 + 2 = 3 \) probes.
   - Hence, the total number of probes can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total Probes} = 1 + 1 + 3 \cdot \left(\frac{m - 2}{2}\right) \text{ (for } m \text{ even)}
   \]
   - If \( m \) is odd, we simply need to add one more probe for the last key, which would also take \( 2 \) probes (for the last key).

4. **Final Expression**:
   - For \( m \) even:
   \[
   \text{Total Probes} = 2 + 3 \cdot \left(\frac{m - 2}{2}\right) = 2 + \frac{3(m - 2)}{2} = \frac{3m}{2} - 1.
   \]
   - For \( m \) odd:
   \[
   \text{Total Probes} = \frac{3m}{2} - 1 + 2 = \frac{3m}{2} + 1.
   \]

### Asymptotic Bound

5. **Simplifying for Big-O Notation**:
   - Regardless of whether \( m \) is odd or even, the dominant term in the total probes is \( \frac{3m}{2} \).
   - Therefore, the total insertion time is asymptotically:
   \[
   O(m).
   \]

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the total time to insert all \( m \) keys into the hash table using linear probing is \( O(m) \). This reflects the linear growth in the number of probes required as we insert more elements into the table, especially due to the collisions caused by the hash function.

Does this summation and analysis make sense, or is there anything else you would like to discuss further?
Teacher: Great effort so far! Your approach shows you understand that we need to sum up the probe costs for each key’s insertion. However, before we settle on a summation, let’s carefully re-examine the evolving pattern of probe costs as more keys are inserted.

Recall the example:

• Key 1 goes into slot 0 with 1 probe.
• Key 2 goes into slot 1 with 1 probe.
• Key 3, with h(3) = 1, finds slot 1 occupied and goes to slot 2 (2 probes).
• Key 4, with h(4) = 2, finds slot 2 occupied (by key 3) and goes to slot 3 (2 probes).

Now, think about what happens next:

• For key 5, h(5) = 2. When you probe:
 – First, you check slot 2 (occupied),
 – then slot 3 (occupied),
 – and finally slot 4 (free).
Thus, key 5 requires 3 probes. Similarly, key 6 (h(6)=3) will likely follow a similar pattern.

Notice that after key 4, the cluster of occupied slots grows, and each new pair of keys will “push” the probe count one higher compared to the previous pair.

To summarize the pattern:
– Keys 1 and 2: costs 1 and 1.
– Keys 3 and 4: costs 2 and 2.
– Keys 5 and 6: costs 3 and 3.
– Keys 7 and 8: costs 4 and 4.
…and so on.

So if we group the keys (starting from keys 3 and 4) into pairs, each pair (say the i‑th pair) incurs a cost of 2 · i probes.

Based on this, could you try to write a summation expression for the total number of probes when inserting m keys? (You might consider a separate treatment for key 1, and then grouping the rest into pairs.) What would that summation look like?
Student: Absolutely! Let's carefully construct the summation expression for the total number of probes required to insert all \( m \) keys into the hash table, taking into account the pattern we’ve observed.

### Breakdown of Insertion Costs

1. **Initial Keys**:
   - **Key 1**: Takes \( 1 \) probe.
   - **Key 2**: Takes \( 1 \) probe.

2. **Subsequent Keys**:
   - For keys \( 3 \) and \( 4 \): Each takes \( 2 \) probes.
   - For keys \( 5 \) and \( 6 \): Each takes \( 3 \) probes.
   - For keys \( 7 \) and \( 8 \): Each takes \( 4 \) probes.
   - This pattern continues, where every subsequent pair of keys takes an increasing number of probes based on how many keys have already been inserted.

### General Pattern

For keys \( 3 \) to \( m \):
- Let’s denote the pairs of keys as \( (2i, 2i + 1) \) for \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, \lfloor \frac{m - 2}{2} \rfloor \).
- The cost to insert the \( i \)-th pair is \( 2 \cdot i \) probes.

### Total Probes Calculation

1. **Cost for Keys 1 and 2**:
   \[
   \text{Cost}_{1,2} = 1 + 1 = 2.
   \]

2. **Cost for Pairs from Keys 3 to \( m \)**:
   - The number of pairs from keys \( 3 \) to \( m \) is:
     \[
     \text{Number of pairs} = \left\lfloor \frac{m - 2}{2} \right\rfloor.
     \]
   - The total cost for these pairs can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Cost}_{pairs} = \sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor \frac{m-2}{2} \rfloor} 2i.
     \]
   - The summation \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} i \) is given by the formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \). Thus, we have:
     \[
     \text{Cost}_{pairs} = 2 \cdot \frac{\lfloor \frac{m-2}{2} \rfloor \left( \lfloor \frac{m-2}{2} \rfloor + 1 \right)}{2} = \lfloor \frac{m-2}{2} \rfloor \left( \lfloor \frac{m-2}{2} \rfloor + 1 \right).
     \]

3. **Total Cost**:
   - Combining both parts, the total number of probes required for inserting all \( m \) keys becomes:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 2 + \lfloor \frac{m-2}{2} \rfloor \left( \lfloor \frac{m-2}{2} \rfloor + 1 \right).
   \]

### Asymptotic Behavior

4. **Simplifying for Big-O Notation**:
   - As \( m \) grows large, the dominant term in the total cost will be driven by the \( \frac{m^2}{8} \) behavior from the summation of the pairs.
   - Therefore, the overall insertion time is asymptotically:
   \[
   O(m^2).
   \]

### Conclusion

Thus, the total time to insert all \( m \) keys into the hash table using linear probing is \( O(m^2) \). This reflects the quadratic growth in the number of probes required as we insert more elements, particularly due to the increasing number of collisions caused by the hash function.

Does this summation and analysis align with your understanding, or would you like to discuss any specific part further?
Teacher: You've provided a summation that breaks the cost into an initial 2 probes for keys 1 and 2, and then for every pair of keys from 3 onward you used

  Total Cost = 2 + Σ₍ᵢ₌₁₎^(⌊(m–2)/2⌋) (2i)

which you rewrote as

  2 + ⌊(m–2)/2⌋ (⌊(m–2)/2⌋ + 1).

That’s a very good start. Now, let’s work on the next step together:

Please simplify this expression asymptotically. In other words, express the dominant term as m grows large and argue why the overall cost is, say, O(m²).

What do you get as the asymptotic bound for the total cost, and how do you justify it?
Student: Sure! Let's simplify the expression we derived for the total cost of inserting all \( m \) keys and analyze the dominant term as \( m \) grows large.

### Total Cost Expression Recap
We had the total cost expressed as:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 2 + \left\lfloor \frac{m-2}{2} \right\rfloor \left( \left\lfloor \frac{m-2}{2} \right\rfloor + 1 \right).
\]

### Simplifying the Expression
1. **Focus on the Floor Function**: For large \( m \), we can approximate:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{m-2}{2} \right\rfloor \approx \frac{m-2}{2}.
   \]
   This approximation holds because the floor function will only affect the expression by a small constant factor, which becomes negligible as \( m \) increases.

2. **Substituting the Approximation**:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} \approx 2 + \left( \frac{m-2}{2} \right) \left( \frac{m-2}{2} + 1 \right).
   \]
   Expanding this gives:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} \approx 2 + \frac{(m-2)(m-2 + 2)}{4} = 2 + \frac{(m-2)(m)}{4} - \frac{(m-2)(2)}{4}.
   \]

3. **Focusing on the Dominant Term**:
   - The dominant term in this expression as \( m \) grows large is:
   \[
   \frac{m^2}{4} - O(m) \text{ (the lower order terms become negligible)}.
   \]
   Thus, for large \( m \), we can simplify the total cost to:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} \approx \frac{m^2}{4} \text{ (dominant term)}.
   \]

### Asymptotic Bound
4. **Expressing in Big-O Notation**:
   - Since the dominant term is \( \frac{m^2}{4} \), we can express the asymptotic behavior of the total cost as:
   \[
   O(m^2).
   \]

### Justification
The reason we conclude that the overall cost is \( O(m^2) \) is due to the fact that as the number of keys increases, the number of collisions also increases significantly, leading to more probing steps. Each new key has a higher chance of colliding with previously inserted keys, thus requiring more probes, which accumulates to a quadratic growth in the total insertion time.

### Conclusion
Therefore, the total time to insert all \( m \) keys into the hash table using linear probing is \( O(m^2) \). This reflects the increasing complexity of the insertion process as the table becomes more populated.

Does this final simplification and justification align with your understanding, or is there anything else you would like to discuss?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've shown that by grouping the keys (after the initial two) into pairs where the i‑th pair costs 2i probes, the total cost expression becomes

  2 + Σ₍ᵢ₌₁₎^(⌊(m–2)/2⌋) (2i).

For large m, approximating ⌊(m–2)/2⌋ as about m/2 leads to a dominant term roughly (m/2)², i.e. about m²/4, so the overall cost is asymptotically O(m²).

You've justified that the quadratic term dominates, as the number of probes increases linearly with i, and summing that over roughly m/2 pairs leads to quadratic growth.

Now, please provide your final answer for the overall insertion time using this asymptotic bound.
Student: The overall time to insert all \( m \) keys into the hash table using linear probing, as derived from our analysis, is \( O(m^2) \). This reflects the quadratic growth in insertion time due to the increasing number of collisions and the corresponding need for additional probing steps as more keys are inserted into the table. 

In summary, the total insertion time is:

\[
\text{Total Insertion Time} = O(m^2).
\] 

Thank you for guiding me through this problem! If there's anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify, please let me know!
Teacher: Your final answer is: O(m²)$
