Question: We build a hashing table of size \( m \) using the linear probing method. The keys of the elements inserted into the table are taken from the set \( \{0, 1, \dots, 2m-1\} \). We use the following hash function:
\[
h(k) = \left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor.
\]
We insert the elements \( 1, 2, \dots, m \) into the table in increasing order. How much time does it take to insert all the elements into the table using the standard insertion algorithm? Provide an asymptotic bound.
Teacher: Let's start by outlining a plan to tackle this problem without jumping to the final answer.

Step 1: Understand the hashing function and the order of insertions.
• The hash function is h(k) = ⎣k/2⎦.
• We are inserting keys 1, 2, …, m in increasing order.
• Notice that keys with consecutive values might hash to the same index. For instance, think about what happens when you hash two consecutive integers with this function. 

Could you explain what values two consecutive keys (say, some even number and the next odd or vice versa) would hash to? Please work on this next step and share your reasoning.
Student: Sure! Let's analyze the hash function \( h(k) = \left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor \) for consecutive keys.

1. **For an even key \( k = 2n \)**:
   - When we apply the hash function:
     \[
     h(2n) = \left\lfloor \frac{2n}{2} \right\rfloor = n.
     \]

2. **For the next consecutive odd key \( k = 2n + 1 \)**:
   - Applying the hash function gives us:
     \[
     h(2n + 1) = \left\lfloor \frac{2n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor n + \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor = n.
     \]

From this analysis, we can see that both consecutive keys \( 2n \) (even) and \( 2n + 1 \) (odd) hash to the same index \( n \). 

This means that when we insert the keys \( 1, 2, \dots, m \) into the table, every pair of consecutive keys will collide and lead to a situation where we need to use linear probing to find the next available slot.

Now, if we continue this reasoning, we can determine how many collisions occur and how that affects the overall insertion time. Would you like to discuss how many total insertions and collisions we can expect as we proceed with the insertion of all \( m \) keys?
Teacher: Great job analyzing the hashing function! You've correctly shown that any pair of consecutive keys such as 2n and 2n+1 both hash to the same index n, which sets up collisions when we insert them in increasing order.

Now let's move on to the next step. We want to analyze the effect of these collisions on insertion time. Specifically, consider how linear probing works: when a collision occurs, the algorithm checks the next available slot. 

Here's what I'd like you to do next:
• Pick one of these pairs (or analyze the sequence in general) and explain how the collisions accumulate. For example, once the first key of a pair is inserted in its hashed position, what happens when you try to insert the second key (which hashes to the same index)? 
• Then, try to generalize: as you insert keys 1, 2, …, m in order, how do these collisions add up? Think of it in terms of a sum or sequence. What does this suggest about the overall number of probes (or inspections) performed during all insertions?
• Finally, how might you express the asymptotic bound (e.g., in Big-O notation) for the total insertion time based on your reasoning?

Please work on this step and share your reasoning for how the total collision count (and associated probing time) accumulates, and how that leads to an asymptotic bound.
Student: Sure! Let's analyze how the collisions accumulate during the insertion of keys \( 1, 2, \ldots, m \) into the hash table using linear probing.

### Step-by-Step Analysis of Collisions and Probing

1. **First Insertion**: 
   - When we insert the first key \( 1 \):
     \[
     h(1) = \left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor = 0.
     \]
   - The key \( 1 \) is placed at index \( 0 \).

2. **Second Insertion**:
   - For the second key \( 2 \):
     \[
     h(2) = \left\lfloor \frac{2}{2} \right\rfloor = 1.
     \]
   - The key \( 2 \) is placed at index \( 1 \).

3. **Third Insertion**:
   - For the third key \( 3 \):
     \[
     h(3) = \left\lfloor \frac{3}{2} \right\rfloor = 1.
     \]
   - Here, a collision occurs because index \( 1 \) is already occupied by key \( 2 \). The algorithm will check index \( 2 \) (next available slot) and successfully place key \( 3 \) there.

4. **Continuing the Pattern**:
   - For each pair of consecutive keys \( (2n, 2n + 1) \):
     - Both keys hash to the same index \( n \).
     - The first key \( 2n \) occupies index \( n \).
     - The second key \( 2n + 1 \) will collide and probe to the next available index, which may lead to further collisions depending on how many keys have already been placed.

### Generalizing the Collision Count

As we continue this process for all keys up to \( m \):

- Each even key \( 2n \) occupies its hashed index \( n \).
- Each odd key \( 2n + 1 \) will collide with the even key and will require probing.
- The number of probes for each odd key \( 2n + 1 \) is proportional to the number of keys already inserted that hash to the same index or the next available slots.

### Total Probes and Insertion Time

If we denote the number of keys inserted as \( m \):

- For the first key, it takes \( 1 \) probe.
- For the second key, it takes \( 1 \) probe.
- For the third key, it takes \( 2 \) probes (one for the collision).
- For the fourth key, it takes \( 1 \) probe.
- For the fifth key, it takes \( 3 \) probes (one for the collision and two for probing).

Continuing this pattern, we can see that the total number of probes accumulates as follows:

- The first \( m \) keys will lead to approximately \( m/2 \) collisions (since every pair of consecutive keys collides).
- The number of probes for each collision increases linearly with the number of keys already inserted.

### Summation of Probes

The total number of probes can be approximated by the series:
\[
1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + \ldots \approx O(m^2)
\]
because the average number of probes per insertion grows as \( O(n) \) with increasing \( n \).

### Asymptotic Bound

Thus, the overall time complexity for inserting all \( m \) elements into the table using linear probing, given the hash function and the nature of the collisions, can be expressed as:
\[
O(m^2).
\]

This means that as the number of keys \( m \) increases, the time taken to insert them into the hash table grows quadratically due to the collisions and the probing required to resolve them. 

Would you like to go over any specific part of this reasoning or clarify further?
Teacher: Great job working through the collision behavior and starting to set up the summation for the number of probes. You've outlined that even keys are inserted with no collision, while odd keys collide and require extra probing. Now, let's move on to the next step:

Step 3: Please clearly formulate the sum that represents the total number of probes (or inspections) needed for inserting all m keys. Consider how many probes each key requires in the worst case, and then express that as a series. Once you write out that sum, simplify or analyze it to determine its asymptotic behavior (in Big-O notation).

Take your time to set up that summation and explain your reasoning. What series do you get for the total insertion work?
Student: Sure! Let's formulate the sum that represents the total number of probes needed for inserting all \( m \) keys into the hash table using linear probing.

### Analyzing Probes per Insertion

As we've established, the first key requires \( 1 \) probe, the second key requires \( 1 \) probe, and the third key (which collides with the second) requires \( 2 \) probes. Continuing this pattern:

- For even keys \( 2n \), they each take \( 1 \) probe.
- For odd keys \( 2n + 1 \), they collide with the previous even key and require an increasing number of probes based on how many keys have already been inserted.

### Total Probes Calculation

Let's denote \( P_k \) as the number of probes required to insert the \( k \)-th key. The pattern we see is:

- For keys \( 1 \) and \( 2 \): \( P_1 = 1 \), \( P_2 = 1 \)
- For key \( 3 \): \( P_3 = 2 \)
- For key \( 4 \): \( P_4 = 1 \)
- For key \( 5 \): \( P_5 = 3 \)
- For key \( 6 \): \( P_6 = 2 \)
- For key \( 7 \): \( P_7 = 4 \)
- And so on...

In general, for each odd key \( 2n + 1 \), the number of probes required can be approximated to be proportional to the number of keys already inserted, which grows linearly with \( n \).

### Formulating the Sum

Now, let's write the total number of probes \( T(m) \) for inserting all \( m \) keys:

\[
T(m) = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + \ldots + P_m.
\]

To express this more clearly, we can separate the contributions from even and odd keys:

- Each even key contributes \( 1 \) probe.
- Each odd key \( 2n + 1 \) contributes \( n + 1 \) probes on average, where \( n \) is the number of previous keys.

This leads us to consider the contributions from all odd keys. Specifically, if we consider the odd keys \( 1, 3, 5, \ldots, 2n + 1 \), we can express the total probes needed as:

\[
T(m) = \sum_{k=1}^{m} P_k.
\]

### Simplifying the Series

To simplify this sum, we can observe that for every pair of consecutive keys (even and odd), the total number of probes can be approximated by:

\[
T(m) \approx m + \sum_{n=1}^{\lfloor m/2 \rfloor} n,
\]

where \( m \) is the number of keys, and the summation \( \sum_{n=1}^{\lfloor m/2 \rfloor} n \) is the sum of the first \( \lfloor m/2 \rfloor \) integers.

Using the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) integers:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2},
\]

we have:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\lfloor m/2 \rfloor} n \approx \frac{(\lfloor m/2 \rfloor)(\lfloor m/2 \rfloor + 1)}{2}.
\]

### Final Asymptotic Behavior

Putting it all together, we find that:

\[
T(m) = O(m) + O\left(\frac{m^2}{4}\right) = O(m^2).
\]

Thus, the total number of probes required to insert all \( m \) keys into the hash table using linear probing is:

\[
T(m) = O(m^2).
\]

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the asymptotic bound for the total insertion time when using linear probing in this hash table scenario is \( O(m^2) \). This reflects the quadratic growth in insertion time due to the collisions and the need for linear probing to resolve them. 

Do you have any further questions or would you like to explore any specific aspect of this analysis?
Teacher: You've done a thorough job setting up the summation and reasoning through the collision count. Now, let's move to the next step:

Step 4: Please summarize your reasoning briefly and clearly state the overall asymptotic time complexity for inserting all m keys. Once you've summarized your reasoning, give your final answer in Big-O notation. Remember to write only the final answer followed immediately by a $ (with nothing after the $).

What is your final answer?
Student: The overall insertion process involves inserting \( m \) keys into a hash table using linear probing. Due to the hash function \( h(k) = \left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor \), consecutive keys collide, leading to increased probing times. Each even key takes \( 1 \) probe, while each odd key, which collides with the previous even key, requires additional probes proportional to the number of previously inserted keys. This results in a total number of probes that can be approximated as \( O(m^2) \).

Therefore, the final answer for the asymptotic time complexity for inserting all \( m \) keys is:

\( O(m^2) $
Teacher: Great work! You've summarized the reasoning that the collisions caused by the pair insertion pattern result in a total number of probes that grows roughly as the sum of the first m/2 numbers, leading to an overall quadratic, O(m²), behavior for the entire insertion process.

Your final answer is correct. 

O(m^2)$
