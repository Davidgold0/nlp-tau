Question: Given \( n \) distinct and sorted keys, describe an efficient data structure that maintains these keys (assume the structure is already built, so the cost of building it is not important) and supports the operation \( \text{find\_delete(key)} \), which receives a key and returns false if the key is not in the structure. If the key is in the structure, the operation returns true and removes it from the structure.  

Required cost: \( O(\log n) \) for the \( \text{find\_delete(key)} \) operation.
3o-mini: One common and efficient solution is to store the keys in a balanced binary search tree (BST), such as a redâ€“black tree, AVL tree, or skip list. The keys are initially distinct and sorted, and the data structure is built ahead of time.

With a balanced BST, the operation find_delete(key) works as follows:
1. Search for the given key in the tree. This search takes O(log n) time because the tree is balanced.
2. If the key is not found, return false immediately.
3. If the key is found, delete it from the tree. The deletion process also takes O(log n) time because it involves rebalancing the tree if necessary.

Thus, the overall cost for find_delete(key) is O(log n).

Since building the structure is not a concern here, the balanced BST provides an efficient way to support the required operations on a dynamic set of keys in the desired O(log n) time per operation.
