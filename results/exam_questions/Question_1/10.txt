Question: A pair of values in an array are called consecutive if they are different and, after sorting, they appear in adjacent positions in the array.  

Given an array of natural numbers of size \( n \), propose an algorithm (with the best worst-case complexity) that checks whether there exists a pair of consecutive values whose total occurrences together are at least \( k \)  
(that is, the number of times a certain value appears plus the number of times its consecutive value appears is at least \( k \)).
3o-mini: We can solve the problem by first “compressing” the array into its distinct numbers together with their frequencies and then checking, in sorted order, if any two adjacent distinct numbers have a combined frequency of at least k.

Step 1. Build a frequency table.
• Traverse the array once and use a hash table (or dictionary) to count how many times each natural number appears.
• This step takes O(n) time.

Step 2. Obtain the distinct values in sorted order.
• Extract the keys (distinct natural numbers) from the frequency table.
• Sort these keys in increasing order. Let the sorted array be D.
• Since there are m distinct values (with m ≤ n), sorting takes O(m log m) worst-case. (If extra assumptions are available on the range of numbers, you might be able to use counting sort to achieve linear time, but in general O(m log m) is optimal.)

Step 3. Check consecutive pairs.
• Now, by definition, a “pair of consecutive values” is a pair (a, b) where a and b are distinct, and b immediately follows a in the sorted order.
• Loop over each adjacent pair in D, and check if the total occurrences (i.e. frequency of D[i] plus frequency of D[i+1]) is at least k.
• If you find any such pair, return True.
• If no such pair is found, return False.
• This step takes O(m) time.

Pseudocode:

---------------------------------------------------------------
Algorithm ConsecutivePairCheck(A, k):
  1. Let freq be an empty hash table.
  2. For each number x in A:
    if x is not in freq:
      freq[x] = 1
    else:
      freq[x] = freq[x] + 1

  3. Let D be the list of keys in freq.
  4. Sort D in increasing order.
  5. For i from 0 to length(D) - 2 do:
    if (freq[D[i]] + freq[D[i+1]] ≥ k) then:
      return True
  6. Return False
---------------------------------------------------------------

Time Complexity:
• Step 1: O(n)
• Step 2: O(m log m) with m ≤ n. In the worst-case m = n, so this step is O(n log n).
• Step 3: O(m) which is O(n) in the worst-case.
Thus, the overall worst-case complexity is O(n log n).

This algorithm is optimal in the worst-case scenario unless additional properties of the input (like a bounded range for the natural numbers) allow a linear-time sorting process.
