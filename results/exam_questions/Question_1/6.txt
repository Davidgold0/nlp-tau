Question: A pair of values in an array are called consecutive if they are different and, after sorting, they appear in adjacent positions in the array.  

Given an array of natural numbers of size \( n \), propose an algorithm (with the best worst-case complexity) that checks whether there exists a pair of consecutive values whose total occurrences together are at least \( k \)  
(that is, the number of times a certain value appears plus the number of times its consecutive value appears is at least \( k \)).
3o-mini: We can solve the problem with an algorithm that runs in O(n log n) worst-case time. One convenient way is to sort the array and then count the occurrences as you traverse it, checking consecutive distinct numbers along the way.

Below is an outline of one correct algorithm:

1. Sort the array in nondecreasing order. Sorting takes O(n log n) time.

2. Traverse the sorted array to compute the frequency of each distinct number. (As you go, you can record each distinct number along with its frequency in, say, two parallel arrays or in an array of pairs.) This pass takes O(n) time.

3. Now the distinct numbers (and their frequencies) are stored in sorted order. For each pair of adjacent distinct numbers (which are by definition “consecutive values” in the sorted array), compute the sum of their frequencies.

4. If for any such adjacent pair the sum of the frequencies is at least k, then output “yes” (or true) — otherwise, after checking all pairs, output “no” (or false).

Here is a pseudocode version of the algorithm:

-------------------------------------------------
function hasConsecutivePairWithFrequencyAtLeastK(array A, integer k):
    # Step 1: Sort the array.
    sort(A)  # O(n log n)
    
    # Step 2: Compute frequency for each distinct number.
    let val = A[0]
    let count = 1
    let distinctValues = []  # to store distinct numbers.
    let frequencies = []    # to store corresponding counts.
    
    for i from 1 to length(A)-1:  # O(n)
        if A[i] == val:
            count = count + 1
        else:
            append val to distinctValues
            append count to frequencies
            val = A[i]
            count = 1
    # Don't forget the last distinct number.
    append val to distinctValues
    append count to frequencies
    
    # Step 3: Check adjacent distinct values.
    for j from 0 to length(distinctValues) - 2:   # There are at most n distinct numbers.
        if frequencies[j] + frequencies[j+1] >= k:
            return true
            
    return false
-------------------------------------------------

Time Complexity Analysis:
• Sorting takes O(n log n) time.
• The linear scans to count frequency and to check the pairs each take O(n) time.
• Thus, the overall worst-case complexity is O(n log n).

Alternate Approach:
If one were allowed to use a hash table to count the frequency of each number (this takes O(n) average time but O(n) worst-case if, say, balanced BST is used to guarantee worst-case performance), then you could:
1. Use the hash table to compute the frequencies in O(n) time.
2. Extract the distinct keys and sort them (O(d log d) time, where d ≤ n).
3. Check adjacent keys as above.

This approach also results in an overall worst-case complexity of O(n log n) if sorting is used.

Thus, the best worst-case complexity for this problem is O(n log n).
