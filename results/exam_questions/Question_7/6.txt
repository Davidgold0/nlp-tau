Question: **Data Structure Description:**

Describe a data structure that maintains a set of points in the plane, where each point \( p_i \) is represented as a pair of numbers \( (x_i, y_i) \). The data structure should support the following operations:

- \( \text{insert}(x, y) \), \( \text{delete}(x, y) \), \( \text{find}(x, y) \) in the worst-case time complexity of \( O(\log n) \).
- \( \text{CountPointsAtDistance}(d_1, d_2) \), which performs the following operation: Given two numbers \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \), the function returns the number of points in the structure whose distance from the origin is greater than \( d_1 \) and smaller than \( d_2 \). Recall that the distance of a point \( (x, y) \) from the origin is \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \).

The \( \text{CountPointsAtDistance}(d_1, d_2) \) operation should be executed with the lowest possible time complexity.
3o-mini: We can achieve all the required operations in O(log n) time per operation by storing our points in a balanced binary search tree (BST) (such as a red–black tree or AVL tree) that is augmented to support order‐statistics (i.e. range count queries).

Below is an outline of how to design the data structure:

1. Point Representation and Keying:
 • Each point is stored as a pair (x, y).
 • To support quick queries by distance from the origin, we associate with each point its Euclidean distance from the origin. Since the square root is a monotonic function, we need not store or compute the actual distance. Instead, we store the value d² = x² + y².
 • We will use d² as the key in our BST.

2. Augmenting the BST:
 • In addition to the normal BST fields (key, left child, right child, parent pointer, etc.), each node in the tree is augmented with an extra field that records the size (or count) of the subtree rooted at that node. This is a common technique used in “order statistic trees.”
 • With each node having a count of nodes in its subtree, we can quickly compute the rank of any key (i.e. the number of nodes with keys less than a given key) in O(log n) time.

3. Operations:
 a. Insertion, Deletion, and Find:
  – Insertion: When inserting a point (x, y), compute d² = x² + y², and insert the point into the BST based on this key. Also update the subtree sizes along the path. This takes O(log n) time.
  – Deletion: Similarly, when deleting a point (x, y) we locate the corresponding node by its key (taking care of duplicates if they occur), remove the node, and update the subtree sizes. This takes O(log n) time.
  – Find: To check if a point (x, y) exists in the tree, you can simply compute d² and then search the BST for a node with that key (again, managing duplicate keys appropriately). This takes O(log n) time.

 b. CountPointsAtDistance(d1, d2):
  – Given d1 and d2, we are required to count the number of points whose Euclidean distance from the origin is greater than d1 and less than d2. Since we have stored squared distances, this is equivalent to counting the points with keys in the range (d1², d2²).
  – To do this efficiently, we perform two “rank” queries:
   • rank(d2²): This gives the number of points with key < d2².
   • rank(d1²): This gives the number of points with key < d1².
  – The number of points with keys in the desired range is then rank(d2²) – rank(d1²). Each rank query takes O(log n) time, and the subtraction is constant time.

4. Time Complexity Recap:
 • insert(x, y): O(log n)
 • delete(x, y): O(log n)
 • find(x, y): O(log n)
 • CountPointsAtDistance(d1, d2): O(log n)

Thus, by using an augmented balanced BST keyed by the squared Euclidean distance of the points, we can efficiently support all the required operations with the desired time complexity.

This design is both simple and optimal for the given specification.
