Question: **Data Structure Description:**

Describe a data structure that maintains a set of points in the plane, where each point \( p_i \) is represented as a pair of numbers \( (x_i, y_i) \). The data structure should support the following operations:

- \( \text{insert}(x, y) \), \( \text{delete}(x, y) \), \( \text{find}(x, y) \) in the worst-case time complexity of \( O(\log n) \).
- \( \text{CountPointsAtDistance}(d_1, d_2) \), which performs the following operation: Given two numbers \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \), the function returns the number of points in the structure whose distance from the origin is greater than \( d_1 \) and smaller than \( d_2 \). Recall that the distance of a point \( (x, y) \) from the origin is \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \).

The \( \text{CountPointsAtDistance}(d_1, d_2) \) operation should be executed with the lowest possible time complexity.
3o-mini: We can achieve the required operations by storing the points in a balanced binary search tree (such as an AVL tree or a red–black tree) that is augmented to support order‐statistics queries. One standard technique is as follows.

Step 1. Key Definition

Instead of storing the point simply as (x, y), we compute its squared distance from the origin, d² = x² + y². (We use the squared distance because the square‐root function is monotone increasing; that is, if d1 < d2 then d1² < d2². Storing the squared distance avoids the cost and potential precision issues associated with computing square roots.)

We then define the key for each point as a tuple:
  Key(p) = (d², x, y)
This tuple ordering makes sure that if two points have the same distance from the origin, they can be ordered (say, by x first and then y) so that every point is uniquely placed in the tree.

Step 2. Choosing the Data Structure

Use a balanced binary search tree (BST)—for instance, a red–black tree or AVL tree—with each node storing one point’s key. (Many libraries provide implementations of such trees.) In addition, augment every node with the size of its subtree (i.e. the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at that node). This extra piece of information allows us to perform “rank” queries efficiently.

Step 3. Operation Details

• insert(x, y): Compute d² = x² + y² and form Key(p). Insert the key into the tree in O(log n) worst-case time while updating subtree sizes along the path.

• delete(x, y): Similarly, compute d² = x² + y² and form Key(p) and then delete it from the tree; update subtree sizes as needed. This takes O(log n) worst-case time.

• find(x, y): Compute the key and then search in the BST in O(log n) time.

• CountPointsAtDistance(d1, d2): We need to count how many points have a Euclidean distance greater than d1 and less than d2. Note that
  d1 < sqrt(x²+y²) < d2  ⟺  d1² < x²+y² < d2².
Thus, we want to count the number of points whose key’s first component (d²) lies in the open interval (d1², d2²).

Using our augmented BST, we can perform this count as follows:
 1. Compute the “rank” (i.e. the number of nodes with key less than a given value) for the key (d1², -∞, -∞) (essentially the smallest key with squared distance greater than d1²).
 2. Similarly, compute the rank for the key (d2², -∞, -∞).
 3. The number of points in the range is the difference between these two ranks.

Since each rank query on an order‐statistics tree takes O(log n) time, this operation can also be performed in O(log n) time.

Step 4. Summary

The final data structure is:
 – A balanced BST keyed on (x²+y², x, y)
 – Each node is augmented with the size of its subtree to allow order‐statistic (rank) queries.
 – insert, delete, and find are done in O(log n) worst-case time.
 – CountPointsAtDistance(d1, d2) is implemented by computing two rank queries, hence it runs in O(log n) time.

This is one of the most efficient solutions for maintaining a dynamic set of 2D points and answering range queries based on distance from the origin.
