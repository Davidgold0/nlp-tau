Question: Two AVL trees of size \( n \) each are given. Can they be merged in \( O(n) \) time? Prove using an algorithm or disprove.
3o-mini: Yes, you can merge two AVL trees of size n each in O(n) time. One standard method is to convert the trees into sorted arrays, merge the arrays, and then convert the sorted array back into a balanced AVL tree. Here’s an outline of the algorithm and its proof of O(n) time complexity:

1. In-order Traversal to Arrays:  
  • Traverse each AVL tree in order (in-order traversal) to get two sorted arrays.  
  • Since an in-order traversal visits each node exactly once, each traversal takes O(n) time.  
  • Total time for this step is O(n) + O(n) = O(n).

2. Merge Sorted Arrays:  
  • Merge the two sorted arrays into one sorted array.  
  • Merging two sorted arrays of size n takes O(n) time (it’s essentially the same as the merge step in merge sort).  
  • This step takes O(n) time.

3. Build a Balanced AVL Tree:  
  • Now, given a sorted array with 2n elements, you can build a balanced binary search tree (and subsequently, an AVL tree) in O(n) time by recursively choosing the middle element as the root and constructing the left and right subtrees from the two halves.  
  • This procedure also runs in O(n) time.

Total Time Complexity:  
  O(n) (first step) + O(n) (second step) + O(n) (third step) = O(n).

Thus, by following this process, you merge the two AVL trees in O(n) time.

Note:  
This algorithm uses extra space proportional to the number of nodes (for storing the sorted arrays). If extra space is not allowed, the problem becomes more complicated, and one might need to use in-place merging techniques. However, if extra space is acceptable, then the above method is a straightforward way to achieve O(n) merging time.
