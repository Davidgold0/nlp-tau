Question: Two AVL trees of size \( n \) each are given. Can they be merged in \( O(n) \) time? Prove using an algorithm or disprove.
3o-mini: Yes, two AVL trees of size n each can be merged in O(n) time. Here’s one algorithm and its explanation:

1. In‑order Traversal:  
 a. Perform an in‑order traversal on the first AVL tree to produce a sorted array A1 of n elements.  
 b. Do the same for the second AVL tree to obtain a sorted array A2 of n elements.  
 Since an in‑order traversal visits each node exactly once, each traversal takes O(n) time.

2. Merge Sorted Arrays:  
 Take the two sorted arrays A1 and A2, and merge them into one sorted array A of 2n elements.  
 This is similar to the merge step in the merge sort algorithm, which takes O(n) time.

3. Construct a Balanced BST:  
 Now that you have a sorted array A of 2n elements, you can build a balanced binary search tree (BST) from it.  
 The standard procedure is to pick the middle element of the array as the root, and then recursively construct the left subtree from the left half of the array and the right subtree from the right half.  
 This divide-and-conquer method takes O(2n) = O(n) time.

When you add up the time for each step—O(n) for each in‑order traversal, O(n) for merging, and O(n) for constructing the AVL tree—the total time complexity is O(n).

Proof of Correctness:
• The in‑order traversals produce sorted sequences because an in‑order traversal of a BST (or AVL tree) always visits keys in sorted order.
• Merging two sorted arrays preserves the sorted order, resulting in a correctly sorted array of all elements.
• Building a balanced BST from a sorted array by choosing the middle element as the root ensures the tree remains balanced.
• Thus, the final tree is both balanced (hence an AVL tree) and contains exactly the elements from the two original trees.

So, by following this algorithm, the two AVL trees can indeed be merged in O(n) time.
