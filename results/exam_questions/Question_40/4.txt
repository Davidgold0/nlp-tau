Question: \textbf{Reminder:} In perfect hash, we choose a random universal hash function to map a given space \( U \) of size \( n \) to an array of size \( n \). Let \( n_i \) be the number of elements mapped to cell \( i \). Then, a random universal hash function is used to map the elements mapped to cell \( i \) to another array of size \( n_i^2 \).

\textbf{Question:} 

Define: A nearly universal family of functions is a family of functions from space \( U \) to \(\{0, \ldots, m-1\}\) such that for any pair of keys \( k_1, k_2 \) in \( U \) the condition \( \Pr(h[k_1] = h[k_2]) \leq 1/m^{0.5} \) holds. Suppose we have a nearly universal family when \( |U| = n \). We take a random function from the family and use it to map the elements of \( U \) to an array of size \( m \). What is the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions if \( m = n^4 \)?
Teacher: Let’s begin by breaking down the problem. We are given a nearly universal family of hash functions from a set U (with |U| = n) into an array of size m = n⁴. The nearly universality condition tells us that for any two distinct keys k₁ and k₂, the probability that they hash to the same slot is at most 1/m^(0.5), which in our case gives a bound of 1/n².

A good first step is to figure out:
1. How many pairs of distinct keys are there in U?
2. Then, what is the expected number of collisions if each pair collides with probability at most 1/n²?

Please start by solving for the total number of pairs of keys that can be chosen from the set U. What expression do you get for that number?
Student: To find the total number of pairs of distinct keys that can be chosen from the set \( U \), we can use the combination formula. The number of ways to choose 2 distinct keys from \( n \) keys is given by:

\[
\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]

This expression simplifies to approximately \( \frac{n^2}{2} \) for large \( n \). So, the total number of pairs of distinct keys in \( U \) is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \). 

Would you like me to proceed to the next step and calculate the expected number of collisions using this expression?
Teacher: Great job explaining the number of key pairs correctly! You've shown that there are n(n – 1)/2 pairs, which is approximately n²/2 for large n. Now, let's move on to the next step.

Recall that the nearly universal condition tells us that for each pair, the probability of a collision is at most 1/n². So, the expected number of collisions is the total number of pairs multiplied by the collision probability.

Please calculate the expression (n(n – 1)/2) × (1/n²) and simplify it. What result do you get?
Student: To calculate the expected number of collisions, we take the total number of pairs of keys \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) and multiply it by the probability of a collision for each pair, which is at most \( \frac{1}{n^2} \).

So, the expected number of collisions \( E \) can be expressed as:

\[
E = \left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{n^2}\right)
\]

Now, let's simplify this expression:

\[
E = \frac{n(n-1)}{2n^2} = \frac{n-1}{2n}
\]

For large \( n \), \( n - 1 \) is approximately \( n \), so we can further simplify it to:

\[
E \approx \frac{n}{2n} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the expected number of collisions is approximately \( \frac{1}{2} \). 

Would you like to discuss this result further or proceed to the final conclusion?
Teacher: Great job simplifying the expression! You correctly obtained that the expected number of collisions E is (n–1)/(2n), which for large n is approximately 1/2.

Before we jump to the final conclusion, could you please reflect on and confirm that this result is indeed the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions given the conditions? Once you’re confident, please state your final answer.
Student: Yes, I can confirm that the result we derived, \( E \approx \frac{1}{2} \), is indeed the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions given the conditions of the problem. 

Since we started with a nearly universal family of hash functions and established that for any two distinct keys \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \), the probability of a collision is at most \( \frac{1}{n^2} \), we used this probability to calculate the expected number of collisions based on the total number of pairs of keys. 

Thus, the expected number of collisions is bounded by this calculation, and for large \( n \), it approaches \( \frac{1}{2} \). 

In conclusion, the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions when mapping elements of \( U \) to an array of size \( m = n^4 \) is:

\[
\frac{1}{2}
\] 

Thank you for guiding me through this problem!
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly reasoned through each step. To summarize our discussion:

1. You computed the total number of key pairs correctly as n(n – 1)/2.
2. Multiplying by the collision probability of 1/n², you simplified the expected number of collisions to (n – 1)/(2n), which for large n is approximately 1/2.
3. You then confidently confirmed that the bound of 1/2 is the best upper bound under the given conditions.

Your final answer is:

1/2$
