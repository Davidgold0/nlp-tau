Question: \textbf{Reminder:} In perfect hash, we choose a random universal hash function to map a given space \( U \) of size \( n \) to an array of size \( n \). Let \( n_i \) be the number of elements mapped to cell \( i \). Then, a random universal hash function is used to map the elements mapped to cell \( i \) to another array of size \( n_i^2 \).

\textbf{Question:} 

Define: A nearly universal family of functions is a family of functions from space \( U \) to \(\{0, \ldots, m-1\}\) such that for any pair of keys \( k_1, k_2 \) in \( U \) the condition \( \Pr(h[k_1] = h[k_2]) \leq 1/m^{0.5} \) holds. Suppose we have a nearly universal family when \( |U| = n \). We take a random function from the family and use it to map the elements of \( U \) to an array of size \( m \). What is the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions if \( m = n^4 \)?
Teacher: Let's break down the problem into clear steps before finding the final answer.

Step 1: Understand the collision probability and count the potential collisions. 

We know that for any two distinct keys, say k₁ and k₂, the collision probability is at most 1/m^(0.5). Given m = n⁴, what does this probability become in terms of n? 

Once you determine that, consider how many distinct pairs of keys exist in U (recall that |U| = n). 

Please solve the first part: What is the collision probability for a given pair in terms of n, and how many distinct pairs are there? Provide your answer for this step.
Student: To solve the first part of the problem, let's start by determining the collision probability given \( m = n^4 \).

1. **Collision Probability**: The problem states that the probability of a collision for any two distinct keys \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \) is given by:
   \[
   \Pr(h[k_1] = h[k_2]) \leq \frac{1}{m^{0.5}}.
   \]
   Substituting \( m = n^4 \) into this expression, we get:
   \[
   \Pr(h[k_1] = h[k_2]) \leq \frac{1}{(n^4)^{0.5}} = \frac{1}{n^2}.
   \]

2. **Counting Distinct Pairs**: Next, we need to find the number of distinct pairs of keys in the space \( U \). Since \( |U| = n \), the number of ways to choose 2 distinct keys from \( n \) keys is given by the combination formula:
   \[
   \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}.
   \]
   For large \( n \), we can approximate this as:
   \[
   \binom{n}{2} \approx \frac{n^2}{2}.
   \]

Now, to summarize:

- The collision probability for a given pair of keys \( (k_1, k_2) \) is \( \frac{1}{n^2} \).
- The number of distinct pairs of keys in \( U \) is approximately \( \frac{n^2}{2} \).

Would you like me to proceed to the next step, which involves calculating the expected number of collisions using these results?
Teacher: Great work on resolving the first part of the problem! Now let’s move on to the next step.

Step 2: Use the results from Step 1 to calculate the expected number of collisions. Recall that the expected number of collisions is given by multiplying the total number of distinct pairs by the collision probability for each pair.

Given:
 • The collision probability is at most 1/n² for each pair.
 • The number of distinct pairs is approximately (n²/2).

Can you now calculate the expected number of collisions using these pieces of information? Please show your work for this step.
Student: To calculate the expected number of collisions, we can use the results from Step 1. We have:

1. **Collision Probability**: The collision probability for a given pair of keys \( (k_1, k_2) \) is \( \frac{1}{n^2} \).
2. **Number of Distinct Pairs**: The number of distinct pairs of keys in \( U \) is approximately \( \frac{n^2}{2} \).

Now, we can calculate the expected number of collisions \( E \) using the formula:

\[
E = \text{(Number of distinct pairs)} \times \text{(Collision probability)}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
E = \left(\frac{n^2}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{n^2}\right)
\]

Now, simplifying the expression:

\[
E = \frac{n^2}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the expected number of collisions when mapping the elements of \( U \) to an array of size \( m = n^4 \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

Would you like me to summarize the findings or clarify anything further?
Teacher: Excellent work! Your calculation is correct, and you’ve successfully determined that the expected number of collisions is (n²/2) × (1/n²) = 1/2.

Before we conclude, let’s briefly review our process:
 • First, we computed that the collision probability for any two keys is 1/n².
 • Next, we determined that there are about n(n–1)/2 ≈ n²/2 distinct pairs.
 • Multiplying those together gave an expected collision count of 1/2.

Now that we’ve arrived at the final answer, please state it in your own words, followed by a $ immediately at the end.
Student: The expected number of collisions when mapping the elements of the space \( U \) to an array of size \( m = n^4 \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \). This result was obtained by calculating the collision probability for distinct pairs of keys and then multiplying it by the number of distinct pairs. 

So, the final answer is \( \frac{1}{2} \). $
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly calculated that the expected number of collisions is 1/2. 

Your final answer is: 1/2$
