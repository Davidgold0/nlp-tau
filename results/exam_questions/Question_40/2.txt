Question: \textbf{Reminder:} In perfect hash, we choose a random universal hash function to map a given space \( U \) of size \( n \) to an array of size \( n \). Let \( n_i \) be the number of elements mapped to cell \( i \). Then, a random universal hash function is used to map the elements mapped to cell \( i \) to another array of size \( n_i^2 \).

\textbf{Question:} 

Define: A nearly universal family of functions is a family of functions from space \( U \) to \(\{0, \ldots, m-1\}\) such that for any pair of keys \( k_1, k_2 \) in \( U \) the condition \( \Pr(h[k_1] = h[k_2]) \leq 1/m^{0.5} \) holds. Suppose we have a nearly universal family when \( |U| = n \). We take a random function from the family and use it to map the elements of \( U \) to an array of size \( m \). What is the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions if \( m = n^4 \)?
Teacher: Let's break down the problem into small steps. We’re given that our hash function is from a nearly universal family. In this case, for any two distinct keys k₁ and k₂, we have the bound on the collision probability: Pr[h(k₁) = h(k₂)] ≤ 1/m^(0.5). Since m = n⁴, that probability becomes ≤ 1/(n²).

Step 1: Let's focus on a single pair of distinct keys. What do you think is the collision probability for one specific pair of keys under these conditions? Please explain your reasoning for this step.
Student: Sure! For a single pair of distinct keys \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \), the collision probability given that we are using a nearly universal family of hash functions is defined as the probability that both keys are hashed to the same value in the output array.

According to the information provided, we have:

\[
\Pr[h(k_1) = h(k_2)] \leq \frac{1}{m^{0.5}}.
\]

Since we know that \( m = n^4 \), we can substitute this into the inequality:

\[
\Pr[h(k_1) = h(k_2)] \leq \frac{1}{(n^4)^{0.5}} = \frac{1}{n^2}.
\]

This means that for any specific pair of distinct keys, the probability that they collide (i.e., hash to the same value) is at most \( \frac{1}{n^2} \).

So, to summarize, the collision probability for one specific pair of keys \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \) is at most \( \frac{1}{n^2} \). Would you like me to move on to the next step?
Teacher: Great job on solving Step 1! Your explanation and calculation of the collision probability for a specific pair of keys is correct.

Now, let's move on to Step 2.

Step 2: We need to determine the total number of distinct pairs of keys in the set U. Remember, U has n keys, and there is a pair for every two distinct keys. How many pairs are there (in other words, what is "n choose 2")? Please compute that and explain your reasoning.

Once you've calculated the total number of pairs, please share your answer and reasoning for this step.
Student: Sure! To find the total number of distinct pairs of keys in the set \( U \), which has \( n \) keys, we can use the concept of combinations. Specifically, we want to calculate "n choose 2," which is denoted as \( \binom{n}{2} \).

The formula for combinations is given by:

\[
\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}.
\]

This formula counts the number of ways to choose 2 items from \( n \) items without regard to the order of selection. 

So, applying this formula, we get:

\[
\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}.
\]

Thus, the total number of distinct pairs of keys in the set \( U \) is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

Would you like me to proceed to the next step?
Teacher: Excellent work on Step 2! Now let’s move to the next step.

Step 3: We want to find the expected number of collisions when using the hash function. We already know that for one distinct pair of keys the collision probability is at most 1/n² (from Step 1), and from Step 2, we found there are n(n – 1)/2 distinct pairs in U.

Your task now is to multiply the number of pairs by the collision probability for each pair to obtain the upper bound on the expected number of collisions. Could you please compute this product and simplify the expression? Explain your reasoning as you go along.
Student: Sure! To find the expected number of collisions, we need to multiply the total number of distinct pairs of keys by the collision probability for each pair.

From Step 2, we found that the total number of distinct pairs of keys in the set \( U \) is:

\[
\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}.
\]

From Step 1, we established that the collision probability for one specific pair of keys \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \) is at most:

\[
\Pr[h(k_1) = h(k_2)] \leq \frac{1}{n^2}.
\]

Now, we can compute the expected number of collisions \( E[C] \) by multiplying the number of pairs by the collision probability:

\[
E[C] \leq \text{(number of pairs)} \times \text{(collision probability)}.
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
E[C] \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \times \frac{1}{n^2}.
\]

Now, let's simplify this expression:

\[
E[C] \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2n^2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2n^2} = \frac{(n-1)}{2n}.
\]

As \( n \) grows large, this expression approaches \( \frac{1}{2} \), but it remains valid for all \( n \).

Thus, the upper bound on the expected number of collisions is:

\[
E[C] \leq \frac{(n-1)}{2n}.
\]

This means that the expected number of collisions when mapping \( n \) keys using a nearly universal family of hash functions into an array of size \( m = n^4 \) is at most \( \frac{(n-1)}{2n} \).

Would you like me to clarify anything or proceed further?
Teacher: Great effort on Step 3! Let’s review your work together:

You multiplied the total number of pairs, which is n(n – 1)/2, by the collision probability per pair, 1/n², arriving at

  E[C] ≤ (n(n – 1))/(2n²) = (n – 1)/(2n).

Your simplification is correct. Now, take a moment to reflect: Do you see how, as n grows larger, (n – 1)/(2n) approaches 1/2? This tells you that the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions is (n – 1)/(2n), and asymptotically it is about 1/2.

Before concluding, can you summarize your reasoning and then state the final answer as the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions? Please share your summary and final answer in your own words.
Student: Absolutely! Here’s a summary of my reasoning:

1. **Collision Probability**: We started with the understanding that for any two distinct keys \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \) in our set \( U \), the probability that they collide (i.e., hash to the same value) when using a nearly universal family of hash functions is at most \( \frac{1}{n^2} \).

2. **Number of Distinct Pairs**: We calculated the total number of distinct pairs of keys in the set \( U \) (which has \( n \) keys) using the combination formula, yielding \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) pairs.

3. **Expected Number of Collisions**: By multiplying the number of distinct pairs by the collision probability for each pair, we derived the expected number of collisions as:
   \[
   E[C] \leq \frac{(n-1)}{2n}.
   \]

4. **Asymptotic Behavior**: As \( n \) increases, the expression \( \frac{(n-1)}{2n} \) approaches \( \frac{1}{2} \), indicating that the expected number of collisions stabilizes around this value for large \( n \).

Thus, the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions when using a nearly universal family of hash functions to map \( n \) keys into an array of size \( m = n^4 \) is:

\[
E[C] \leq \frac{(n-1)}{2n}.
\]

As \( n \) grows large, this approaches \( \frac{1}{2} \). 

Thank you for guiding me through this process!
Teacher: Well done! You've successfully reasoned through the entire problem step by step. Your work is clear and correct:

• You started by finding that for any two distinct keys the collision probability is at most 1/n².
• Then, you computed the number of distinct pairs of keys as n(n–1)/2.
• Multiplying these gave the expected number of collisions as (n(n–1))/(2n²), which simplifies to (n–1)/(2n).
• You also noted that as n grows large, (n–1)/(2n) approaches 1/2.

So, the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions is:

(n-1)/(2n)$
