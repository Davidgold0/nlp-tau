Question: Given an array of $n$ numbers. In all questions, we want to find an element that repeats a certain number of times in the array. If there is more than one such element, we should return one of them.
Propose an algorithm to find the repeating element in each of the following cases:

\textbf{a.} It is known that there is an element that repeats at least $L$ times. In this case, randomness can be used.
3o-mini: We can use randomness to “guess” the heavy hitter and then verify it. In particular, suppose we know that some element appears at least L times. (Note that the probability that any random index points to that element is at least L/n.) One acceptable algorithm is as follows:

Algorithm: Random Sampling and Verification

1. Repeat:
 a. Choose a random index i from 1 to n.
 b. Let candidate ← A[i].
 c. Scan the entire array and count how many times candidate appears.
 d. If the count is at least L, return candidate.

Analysis:

• Since there is an element that appears at least L times, when we randomly choose an index, there is at least a probability L/n of picking one of its occurrences.
• Thus, on average, you would need about n/L iterations before picking the heavy hitter.
• Each iteration involves a scan of the array in O(n) time, so the expected total running time is O((n/L) · n) = O(n²/L).
  – If L is a significant fraction of n, this expected running time is good.
  – Even if L is not extremely large, the approach is conceptually simple; one can also repeat the random sampling a fixed number of times (to get a high probability that you eventually hit the heavy hitter) and then return the candidate once verified.
  
Note: There are other deterministic algorithms for variants of this problem (for example, the Boyer–Moore majority vote algorithm when L > n/2); however, the above randomized approach is correct and efficient when an element is known to appear at least L times and randomness is allowed.

Thus, by using random sampling and verifying the candidate by counting its frequency in the array, we can find an element that appears at least L times.
