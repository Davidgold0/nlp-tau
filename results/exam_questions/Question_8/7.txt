Question: **Algorithm Description for Solving the Problem:**

**Input:** A set \( \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\} = A \) of \( n \) numbers.

**Goal:** The algorithm should construct a data structure \( DS \) in the best average-case time, with the following property: Given a collection \( S \) of \( m \) numbers, whose elements are taken from \( A \), we can use \( DS \) to sort the elements of \( S \) in \( O(\max(m, n)) \) worst-case time.  

Note that \( S \) may contain any element of \( A \) multiple times, so it is possible that \( m > n \).
3o-mini: We can solve the problem by “pre‐processing” the set A so that later, given any multiset S (with elements taken from A), we can sort S in time O(max(m,n)). One acceptable solution is to use a “bucket‐sort” style method which exploits the fact that every element of S is one of the n elements from A. (Another possibility is to use perfect hashing to “label” the elements; but the ideas are equivalent.) Here’s one complete description:

─────────────────────────────  
Step 1. Preprocessing A: Building the Data Structure DS

Goal: Construct DS in the best average-case time so that each number in A is “labeled” with its rank in the sorted order.

a. Sort A by any algorithm that is fast on average. (If the numbers can be sorted in linear time using bucket sort or radix sort, then you can achieve O(n) average-case; otherwise, typical comparison–based sorts take O(n log n) worst-case but their average‐case performance is often acceptable.)  
  • Let SortedA[1...n] be the sorted version of A in increasing order.

b. Build a lookup table (or hash table) T so that for every element a ∈ A you can obtain its rank (i.e. the position it appears in SortedA). For example, for each a ∈ A, set  
   T[a] = i  if  SortedA[i] = a  
This lookup table can be built in O(n) time (on average) using standard hashing techniques.

Now our data structure DS consists of the pair (SortedA, T).  
─────────────────────────────  
Step 2. Sorting S Using DS

Assume now that we are given a multiset (or collection) S of m numbers (each taken from A). We want to output S in sorted order in O(max(m,n)) worst-case time.

a. Initalize an array F[1...n] (the “frequency array”) with all entries set to 0. This array will store the number of occurrences of each element in S; the index corresponds to the rank from SortedA.

b. For each element x in S (total of m elements):  
  • Use T to find its rank i in SortedA (this lookup takes O(1) average time per element).  
  • Increment F[i] by 1.

   In total this step takes O(m) time (with constant–time hash lookups on average).

c. Finally, to output S in sorted order, go through the sorted array SortedA from index 1 to n. For every index i, output SortedA[i] exactly F[i] times.  
  • This loop takes O(n + m) time (O(n) for looping through SortedA, and overall O(m) for producing the output, since the total number of outputs is m).

─────────────────────────────  
Overall Complexity

• Building DS: O(n) average-case time (using hashing and a linear-time sort if possible).  
• Sorting S: O(m) time for scanning S plus O(n) time for scanning the frequency array.  
Thus, the total worst-case time later is O(max(m,n)).

Pseudocode

Below is one pseudocode version of the complete algorithm:

------------------------------------------------------------
Algorithm Preprocess(A):
 Input: Set A = {a₁, a₂, …, aₙ}
 Output: DS = (SortedA, T)

 1. SortedA ← sort(A)              // in increasing order
 2. Let T be a new hash table
 3. for i from 1 to n do
   T[SortedA[i]] ← i
 4. return (SortedA, T)

------------------------------------------------------------
Algorithm SortUsingDS(DS, S):
 Input: DS = (SortedA, T) built from A; S is a collection of m numbers (each from A)
 Output: Sorted version of S

 1. Let n = length(SortedA)
 2. Create an array F[1...n] and set each F[i] = 0
 3. for each x in S do
   i ← T[x]        // average-case O(1)
   F[i] ← F[i] + 1
 4. for i from 1 to n do
   for j from 1 to F[i] do
     output SortedA[i]
------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation

• The DS (built from A) takes advantage of the fact that the “universe” of possible elements is exactly the n numbers in A.  
• Looking up the “rank” (or bucket) for each element in S is O(1) on average using T.  
• Counting frequencies and then “unpacking” them by scanning SortedA gives a final time O(m + n) = O(max(m,n)).

This algorithm meets the requirements: DS is constructed in best average-case time, and then any multiset S of m numbers (with m possibly greater than n) is sorted in O(max(m,n)) worst-case time.
