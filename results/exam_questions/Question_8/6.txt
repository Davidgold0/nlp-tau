Question: **Algorithm Description for Solving the Problem:**

**Input:** A set \( \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\} = A \) of \( n \) numbers.

**Goal:** The algorithm should construct a data structure \( DS \) in the best average-case time, with the following property: Given a collection \( S \) of \( m \) numbers, whose elements are taken from \( A \), we can use \( DS \) to sort the elements of \( S \) in \( O(\max(m, n)) \) worst-case time.  

Note that \( S \) may contain any element of \( A \) multiple times, so it is possible that \( m > n \).
3o-mini: We can solve the problem by “preprocessing” the set A into a data structure DS that lets us quickly (in O(1) expected time per lookup) map any element of A to its “sorted order” position. Then, when a query comes with a collection S (which may have m elements, including repeats of numbers in A), we “bucket‐sort” S by counting the occurrences of each element according to its order among A. Here is one way to do it:

Step 1. Preprocessing (Building DS)

Input: A set A = {a₁, a₂, …, aₙ}.

Goal: Build a data structure DS such that given any element s ∈ A we can quickly (in constant expected time) determine its rank (its position in the sorted order of A).

One way to do this is as follows:

1.1. Sort A.  
  • If the numbers have a special format (say, integers with a bounded range), you might use a linear‐time algorithm. Otherwise, using a randomized sorting algorithm (like quicksort) will give you O(n log n) worst-case or expected time.  
  • Let B be the sorted array of A, so that B[1] ≤ B[2] ≤ … ≤ B[n].

1.2. Build a hash table T that maps each element a ∈ A to its index in B.  
  • For each a in A, put into T the pair (a, i) if a is the iᵗʰ element of B.  
  • With a good hash function, this takes expected O(n) time (or O(n) average-case time).

At the end of preprocessing, DS = (B, T) has been built. Notice that DS is constructed “once”, and the average-case cost is as good as possible (for instance, if you can sort A in O(n) average-case time, then the DS construction is O(n)).

──────────────────────────────
Step 2. Answering a Query (Sorting S)

Input: A list S of m numbers, each taken from A (with repetitions allowed).

Goal: Use DS to output S in sorted order in O(max(m, n)) worst‐case time.

Here’s how to do it:

2.1. Allocate an auxiliary array C[1..n] (the “count” array) and initialize every entry to 0.

2.2. For each element s in S:  
  • Look up s in the hash table T to get its rank i in B. This lookup is O(1) expected time (i.e. worst‐case O(1) per lookup if you use a good universal hash function or perfect hashing).  
  • Increment C[i] by 1.

  The total cost for this step is O(m).

2.3. Now, to output the sorted list (or “sorted version”) of S, simply traverse the array C from 1 to n. For each i from 1 to n, output B[i] a total of C[i] times (for example by writing it into the final output array).  

  Since there are n slots to check and the total number of outputs is m, this step takes O(n + m) time.

──────────────────────────────
Overall Running Time

• DS construction – (expected) O(n) (or O(n log n) if you must use a comparison sort, but if the numbers allow it, you can often get O(n)).  
• Answering a query – O(m + n) worst-case time.

Thus, whenever a query S is given, we sort the m numbers in time O(max(m, n)) (since m + n is within that bound).

Summary (Algorithm Description)

Preprocessing:
1. Sort the set A to obtain a sorted array B.
2. Build a hash table T mapping each element a ∈ A to its index (its rank) in B.
  This build process takes O(n) average-case time (or O(n log n) worst-case if using standard comparison sorts).

Query (given S):
1. Create an auxiliary count array C of length n initialized to 0.
2. For each element s in S, look up its rank i from T and do C[i]++.
3. To produce S in sorted order, for i = 1 to n, output B[i] exactly C[i] times.
  This takes O(m + n) worst-case time.

This algorithm meets the requirement: DS is constructed in the best average-case time possible, and then any collection S (of m elements) is sorted in O(max(m, n)) worst-case time.
