Question: Given a min-heap, with no duplicate keys.
Each node \( x \) has an additional field \( s \), which is initialized to \( \text{nil} \). We want the field \( s \) of each node \( x \) to contain a pointer to the successor of \( x \). Assume that access to the heap elements is available (i.e., the heap is not a black box). The heap structure itself should not be changed. Propose an algorithm that achieves this, with the best possible overall worst-case time complexity, given that the keys are integers in the range from 1 to \( 2n \).
3o-mini: We can solve the problem in overall worst‐case O(n) time by taking advantage of the small integer key range. One approach is as follows:

1. Create an auxiliary array (or “bucket” array) B of size 2n + 1 (indexed from 1 to 2n) and initialize every entry to nil.
2. Iterate over all nodes in the heap. For each node x, place a pointer to x in B at index x.key. (Since there are no duplicate keys, each key in the range 1 to 2n will appear at most once.)
3. Now scan the array B in increasing order. As you encounter non‐nil entries, link each with its successor (i.e. set the s field of the previously encountered node to point to the current node).
4. End the scan when you complete index 2n. (The last node’s s field remains nil.)

Step by step pseudocode:

  // Initialize B[1..2n] to nil
  for i = 1 to 2n do
    B[i] = nil

  // Place each node’s pointer in the corresponding bucket
  for each node x in the heap do
    B[x.key] = x

  prev = nil
  for i = 1 to 2n do
    if B[i] ≠ nil then
      if prev ≠ nil then
        prev.s = B[i]  // Link the previous node to the current one
      prev = B[i]
    end if
  end for

Time complexity analysis:
- Initializing the bucket array takes O(2n) = O(n) time.
- Inserting each node into the bucket array takes O(n) time.
- Scanning the bucket array takes O(2n) = O(n) time.

Thus, the overall worst-case time complexity is O(n).

This algorithm does not modify the heap structure; it only fills in the new s pointers for each node in sorted order by key.
