Question: Given a min-heap, with no duplicate keys.
Each node \( x \) has an additional field \( s \), which is initialized to \( \text{nil} \). We want the field \( s \) of each node \( x \) to contain a pointer to the successor of \( x \). Assume that access to the heap elements is available (i.e., the heap is not a black box). The heap structure itself should not be changed. Propose an algorithm that achieves this, with the best possible overall worst-case time complexity, given that the keys are integers in the range from 1 to \( 2n \).
3o-mini: We can achieve the desired result in O(n) worst‐case time. The keys are integers in the range 1 to 2n and there are n nodes (with no duplicate keys), so we can use an auxiliary array to “bucket” the nodes by key. Here’s one way to do it:

1. Create an array A[1…2n] and initialize all entries to nil.
2. Traverse all nodes in the heap (this can be done in O(n) time since the heap is given as an array or through pointers). For each node x with key k, set A[k] = x.
3. Now, iterate over the keys from 1 to 2n. Use a variable (say, last) to keep track of the previous node encountered. Every time you find A[k] ≠ nil:
  a. If last is not nil, set last.s := A[k] (i.e., set the successor pointer for the previous node).
  b. Update last := A[k].

Since there are at most n non-nil entries in A, this second pass also runs in O(n + (2n)) = O(n) time.

Thus, the overall algorithm runs in O(n) worst-case time while preserving the heap structure.
