Question: Given an array of $h$ integers between $0$ and $2^n$.
It is given that each number in the array is a multiple of the upper bound value of $2^N$, divided by $N^3$. Propose an algorithm to sort the array.
3o-mini: We can take advantage of the fact that every number in the array is not arbitrary but rather a multiple of

  K = 2^n / n³.

Thus, every entry in the array is of the form

  x = q · K

for some integer q. Notice that since x is between 0 and 2^n, then

  0 ≤ q · K ≤ 2^n ⟹ 0 ≤ q ≤ n³.

That is, there are at most n³ + 1 distinct values (from 0 to n³), even if h (the number of elements in the array) is very large.

One efficient way to sort the array is to use a counting sort (or bucket sort). Here’s how you can do it:

1. Compute K = 2^n / n³.
2. For each element x in the array, compute q = x / K. (Since x is a multiple of K, this division gives an integer.)
3. Create a count array C of size (n³ + 1) initialized to zero.
4. For each computed q, increment C[q].
5. Finally, traverse the count array in order (from 0 to n³) and output each value q in sorted order by printing q · K the number of times indicated by C[q].

Because the count array is only of size O(n³), and you process h elements once to count and then O(n³) time to output the sorted array, the total time is

  O(h + n³).

This is especially efficient when h is large compared to n³. Moreover, note that by “compressing” the numbers into the q values, you are effectively turning the sorting problem into one that can be handled in linear time relative to the range of distinct keys.

Below is some pseudocode that captures the idea:

------------------------------------------------------------
function sortArray(A, h, n):
    K = 2^n / n^3
    // Create and initialize the count array
    let C be an array of integers of size n^3 + 1, initialized to 0

    // Count each q value
    for i = 0 to h - 1 do:
        q = A[i] / K
        C[q] = C[q] + 1

    // Output the sorted array
    index = 0
    for q = 0 to n^3 do:
        while C[q] > 0 do:
            A[index] = q * K
            index = index + 1
            C[q] = C[q] - 1
------------------------------------------------------------

This counting sort runs in O(h + n³) time and uses O(n³) auxiliary space.

Thus, by taking advantage of the structure in the input (each number being a multiple of 2^n/n³), we reduce the sorting problem to one with a very small range of keys and can sort the array very efficiently using counting sort.
