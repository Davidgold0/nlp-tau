Question: Given an array of $h$ integers between $0$ and $2^n$.
It is given that each number in the array is a multiple of the upper bound value of $2^N$, divided by $N^3$. Propose an algorithm to sort the array.
3o-mini: We can take advantage of the fact that although the input numbers lie in a huge interval—from 0 up to 2ⁿ—they are very “sparse” in the sense that each number is a multiple of

  delta = (2ⁿ)/(n³).

That is, every element x in the array can be written as

  x = k · delta   for some integer k with 0 ≤ k ≤ n³.

Thus there are at most n³ + 1 unique values that can appear in the array. When h (the number of integers) is large compared to n³, the range of different keys is actually very small relative to h. This immediately suggests using a non-comparison sort that takes advantage of the “small universe” of keys. One good choice is counting sort (or bucket sort).

Here is how you can design the algorithm:

1. Determine the “step” size:
  delta = 2ⁿ / n³

2. Create a counting array (or bucket array) Count[0 … n³] initialized to 0.

3. For each element x in the array:
  a. Compute its corresponding index:
    k = x / delta          (since x is guaranteed to be an exact multiple, the division yields an integer)
  b. Increment Count[k] by 1.

4. (Optional) Transform the Count array into a prefix sum array if you want to put the elements in a new array in sorted order (this is how counting sort is normally implemented).

5. Reconstruct the sorted array by, for k from 0 to n³:
  a. Output the number k · delta exactly Count[k] times.

Time complexity:

 • Counting the frequencies takes O(h) time.
 • The Count array has size n³ + 1, so processing the buckets takes O(n³) time.
 • Therefore, the overall time is O(h + n³).

This algorithm is highly efficient if h is large relative to n³ (for example if n is relatively small compared to h), as it “cuts through” the need to compare every pair of numbers. It leverages the special structure of the input.

Thus, the answer is to use counting sort by mapping each integer x to its corresponding index k = x/(2ⁿ/n³) and then reconstructing the sorted list from the counts.
