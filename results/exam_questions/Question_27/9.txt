Question: Given an array of $n$ integers between $0$ and $2^n$.
It is given that each number in the array is a multiple of the upper bound value of $2^N$, divided by $N^3$. Propose an algorithm to sort the array.
3o-mini: We can take advantage of the extra structure in the input. Recall that we have an array A of n integers where

  • each integer x satisfies 0 ≤ x ≤ 2ⁿ,
  • and each x is a multiple of (2ⁿ)/(n³).

In other words, every x in A can be written in the form

  x = k · (2ⁿ)/(n³)

for some integer k. What values can k take? Since x ≤ 2ⁿ we get

  k · (2ⁿ)/(n³) ≤ 2ⁿ ⟹ k ≤ n³.

Thus, k is an integer in the set {0, 1, 2, …, n³}.

Once you recognize that every array element is “scaled” by the same value (let’s call it L, where L = 2ⁿ/n³), you can “normalize” every number by computing

  k = x / L.

Then the problem reduces to sorting n integers k where each k lies between 0 and n³. Notice that although there may be up to n³ + 1 distinct values, there are only n numbers to sort.

There are at least two natural approaches to sorting these numbers efficiently:

───────────────────────────────────────────── 
Approach 1. Counting Sort

Since the normalized values k are integers in a known range [0, n³] you could use counting sort. In the classic counting sort the runtime would be on the order of O(n + range), which in this case is O(n + n³). (If n is very large then n³ may be too big to allocate an array of size n³; however, if you have the memory available then counting sort is acceptable.)

───────────────────────────────────────────── 
Approach 2. Radix Sort with a Suitable Base

Notice that even though k can be as large as n³, its “size” in terms of digits is small. In fact, when written in base n the number k requires only

  ⌊logₙ(n³)⌋ + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4      (or at most 4 digits, and in many cases 3 digits if you treat the leading digit 0 as not needing a pass)
  
digits. (For example, if n = 10 then numbers up to 1000 have 4 digits; if n is larger the constant factor remains small.) 

So you can use a radix sort that processes one digit at a time. For instance, if you use base n then you just need constant (about 3 or 4) passes over the array. Each pass takes O(n) time, so overall the sorting takes O(n) time.

───────────────────────────────────────────── 
Outline of the Radix Sort Algorithm

1. Let L = 2ⁿ/n³.
2. For each number x in A, compute k = x / L.
3. Write k in base n (this will have at most 4 digits).
4. Use least-significant-digit (LSD) radix sort, processing one digit at a time.
5. After sorting the k’s, recover the sorted order of the original numbers (since the mapping x = kL is one‐to‐one).

───────────────────────────────────────────── 

This algorithm takes linear time (with a small fixed constant number of passes) and uses only O(n) extra space. It crucially relies on the fact that the input numbers are all multiples of L = 2ⁿ/n³, which means their “relevant” values (the multiplier k) lie in a small range in terms of number of digits.

Thus, one acceptable algorithm is to “normalize” the array elements by dividing by (2ⁿ/n³) (obtaining integers in the range [0, n³]), then sort these integers with a radix sort (in constant many passes using base n), and finally reconstruct the sorted order for the original numbers. This yields an overall running time of Θ(n).
