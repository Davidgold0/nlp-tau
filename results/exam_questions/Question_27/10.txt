Question: Given an array of $n$ integers between $0$ and $2^n$.
It is given that each number in the array is a multiple of the upper bound value of $2^N$, divided by $N^3$. Propose an algorithm to sort the array.
3o-mini: We can take advantage of the fact that every number in the array is a multiple of a “step size” that is almost as big as the overall range. (In other words, the numbers are “sparse” within the range [0, 2ⁿ].)

For clarity, suppose we have an array A[0…n–1] of n integers, where

  • 0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 2ⁿ, and  
  • each A[i] is a multiple of F = 2ⁿ/(n³).

That is, every A[i] can be written in the form

  A[i] = rᵢ · F       (1)

for some integer rᵢ. Since A[i] ≤ 2ⁿ, we have

  rᵢ · F ≤ 2ⁿ ⟹ rᵢ ≤ n³.

So while there are only n numbers in the array, each one comes from a small set of possible values: rᵢ ∈ {0, 1, 2, …, n³}. (There are n³+1 possible multiples—but note that n³ is much larger than n, so the values are “coarse‐spaced”.)

There are several ways to sort such an array. Two common approaches are described below.

──────────────────────────────
Method 1: Bucket Sort

Because every A[i] is a multiple of F, we can “extract” the multiplier rᵢ from each number by simply computing

  rᵢ = A[i] / F    (since F divides A[i] exactly).

Observe that rᵢ lies in the range 0 to n³. Now, one idea is to use buckets indexed by the possible rᵢ values. For each number A[i] in the array, do the following:

  1. Compute index = rᵢ = A[i] / F.
  2. Place A[i] into bucket[index].

Since there are n items and a total of n³ + 1 buckets, most buckets will be empty. (In fact, the average load per bucket is n/(n³+1) = O(1/n²), which is essentially zero.) Finally, scan the buckets in order (from 0 to n³) and output the numbers in order.

One must be cautious, however, because physically allocating O(n³) buckets may not be acceptable if n is large. Therefore, an alternative is to use a hash table (or a direct-access table if n³ is not too massive) where you store only the buckets that actually get used. Each bucket will have only a few elements (in many cases, just one), so sorting within each bucket (if needed) can be done in constant time.

Method 2: Radix Sort

A second method is to “compress” the given numbers into their multiplier representation rᵢ. In other words, first compute

  rᵢ = A[i] / F.

Note that rᵢ is an integer in the range 0 to n³. The number n³ can be represented in O(log(n³)) = O(log n) bits. This suggests that, if we use radix sort with a carefully chosen base (say base b = n or even base 2^(⌊log n⌋)), we can sort all these numbers in O(n) time in practice (since the number of passes will be O(1) or O(log_{b}(n³)) which is constant when b is chosen proportional to n).

A sketch of the radix sort algorithm is as follows:

  1. For each A[i], compute rᵢ = A[i] / F.
  2. Use LSD (least–significant–digit) radix sort on the array of rᵢ’s.
  3. Use the sorted order of rᵢ’s to rearrange the actual numbers A[i].

Because each rᵢ is only O(log n) bits long when using an appropriate digit base, the sorting can be performed in O(n) time.

Conclusion

Either of these approaches leverages the special structure of the input—the fact that every number is a multiple of 2ⁿ/(n³)—to sort in linear (or near–linear) time.

One acceptable answer to the problem is: 
  Compute F = 2ⁿ/(n³). For each element A[i], compute rᵢ = A[i]/F. Then, sort the rᵢ’s using a constant–number-of–digits radix sort (or “bucket sort” with a hash table keyed by rᵢ) and rearrange the elements accordingly. This algorithm runs in O(n) time, which is asymptotically faster than comparison–based sorting (O(n log n)) in this scenario.

This is a valid solution to the problem.
