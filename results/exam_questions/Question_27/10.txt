Question: Given an array of $h$ integers between $0$ and $2^n$.
It is given that each number in the array is a multiple of the upper bound value of $2^N$, divided by $N^3$. Propose an algorithm to sort the array.
3o-mini: We can take advantage of the fact that every number in the array is a multiple of a fixed “step” value. In particular, if every number x in our array is a multiple of (2^n)/(n³), then we can write

  x = k · (2^n)/(n³)

for some nonnegative integer k. Notice that since 0 ≤ x ≤ 2^n, the possible values of k are

  0 ≤ k ≤ n³.

Thus, even though the original numbers lie in the range [0, 2^n], there are only O(n³) distinct possible values.

Here is one way to sort the array in an efficient manner:

1. Compute the step size d = 2^n / n³. (The problem guarantees that every number in the array is an exact multiple of d.)
2. For each number x in the array, compute its “reduced value” k = x/d. Note that k will be an integer in the range 0 to n³.
3. Use counting sort on these reduced values. Since there are at most n³ + 1 distinct values, and the counting sort runs in time O(h + n³) (where h is the array size), this sorting step is efficient provided n³ is not too large compared to h.
4. If desired, after sorting the reduced values you can convert them back to the original numbers by multiplying by d, although if only the sorted order is required, the sorted k’s already give the correct order.

Thus, by “scaling” the numbers down to a range of size O(n³) and then applying counting sort, we obtain an efficient algorithm.

Summary of the algorithm:

• Precompute d = 2^n/n³.
• For each element x, compute k = x/d.
• Initialize a count array C[0...n³] with all zeros.
• For each k in the array, increment C[k].
• Compute the cumulative counts in C.
• Place each element in its sorted position (or output the sorted order).
• (Optionally) Multiply back by d if you need the original numbers.

Time Complexity: O(h + n³).

This approach takes full advantage of the structure of the input numbers and is usually much faster than a generic O(h log h) sort when h is large and n³ is comparatively small.
