Question: Given an array of $n$ integers between $0$ and $2^n$.
It is given that each number in the array is a multiple of the upper bound value of $2^N$, divided by $N^3$. Propose an algorithm to sort the array.
3o-mini: We can take advantage of the extra structure in the numbers. Suppose we have an array A[1…n] of integers in the range [0, 2^n] and the extra promise that every number is a multiple of

  delta = (2^n) / (n^3).

This means every number A[i] can be written in the form

  A[i] = k · delta      (1)

for some integer k. Note that since the maximum possible A[i] is 2^n, we must have

  k_max = 2^n / delta = 2^n / (2^n/n^3) = n³.

So although the numbers A[i] themselves might look very big (they go up to 2^n) they really come from a “compressed” domain. In fact, if we define

  B[i] = A[i] / delta

then each B[i] is an integer in the range [0, n³] (that is, B[i] has at most ⌈log(n³+1)⌉ = O(log n) bits).

There are several ways you might sort such an array. Here are two approaches:

─────────────────────────────  
Method 1. (Counting Sort)

1. Compute delta = (2^n)/(n^3).

2. For each number x in A, compute its “key”
  key = x / delta.  
   (Since x is a multiple of delta, this division is exact.)

3. Create a counting array C[0 … n³] (note that the range of possible keys is from 0 to n³). Initialize all entries to 0.

4. For each x in A (or equivalently, for each key computed in step 2), do:
  C[key] ← C[key] + 1

5. Finally, for key = 0 to n³, output C[key] copies of (key · delta).  
   This produces the sorted list.

Time Complexity:
  Step 2 and 4 take O(n), and step 5 takes O(n + n³) (since the counting array has size n³+1). In the worst case this is O(n³) time.  
  If n is small or n³ is considered acceptable, this is a simple solution.

─────────────────────────────  
Method 2. (Radix Sort)

Notice that even though the original numbers are in the range [0, 2^n], the transformed numbers B[i] = A[i]/delta lie in [0, n³] which is only O(log n) bits long. (Since n³ has roughly 3 log₂ n bits.) Therefore one can sort the array B[1…n] using radix sort in O(n) time (with a constant number of passes). The steps would be:

1. Compute delta = 2^n/(n^3).

2. Transform each element:
  B[i] = A[i] / delta.  
   (Now each B[i] is between 0 and n³.)

3. Use radix sort (or any other integer sorting algorithm that works in linear time on small integer ranges) to sort the array B in O(n) time since each number has only O(log n) bits.

4. Replace each sorted B[i] with the corresponding A[i] = B[i] · delta.

Time Complexity:
  Because each number has O(log n) bits, radix sort runs in O(n) time, so the overall algorithm is linear in the number of elements.

Conclusion

Either approach gives you a way to sort the array by taking advantage of the fact that every number is a multiple of delta. In many cases the radix sort approach is preferred because it avoids allocating an array of size about n³ and achieves O(n) time even when n is large.

Thus one acceptable answer is: 
1. Compute delta = (2^n)/(n^3) and replace each number x by x/delta (which is in [0,n³]).
2. Sort these transformed numbers (using, say, radix sort in O(n) time).
3. Multiply back by delta to recover the sorted order.

This algorithm takes O(n) time and uses the properties given in the problem.
