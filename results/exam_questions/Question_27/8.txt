Question: Given an array of $h$ integers between $0$ and $2^n$.
It is given that each number in the array is a multiple of the upper bound value of $2^N$, divided by $N^3$. Propose an algorithm to sort the array.
3o-mini: We can take advantage of the extra structure in the numbers. We are given an array A of h integers in the range [0, 2ⁿ] and the extra property that every number is a multiple of

  d = (2ⁿ) / n³.

In other words, every number a in A can be written as

  a = d · k    with k an integer.

Notice that since a ≤ 2ⁿ, we have

  d · k ≤ 2ⁿ ⟹ k ≤ 2ⁿ / d = 2ⁿ / (2ⁿ / n³) = n³.

Thus there are only at most n³ different possible values (namely, the k’s from 0 up to n³).

A very natural way to sort such numbers is by using counting sort (or bucket sort). Here’s the approach:

1. Compute the “gap” value:
  d = (2ⁿ) / n³.
2. Create an auxiliary array C of size n³ + 1 (if you like, indexing from 0 to n³) and initialize all counts to zero.
3. For each number a in A, compute its “bucket index” by:
  index = a / d.
 Since a is always a multiple of d, this division is exact.
4. Increment C[index] (or if you wish, you can keep lists of the actual numbers).
5. Finally, output the values in order. In the “counting sort” version, you do a cumulative sum on C and then place each element in its final position; in the bucket sort version, you simply scan the buckets (from index 0 to n³) in order and output all the numbers that fell into that bucket.

This algorithm runs in O(h + n³) time. Note that if h is very large compared to n³, this is essentially linear in h. Even if h is small compared to n³, the approach is still efficient because the range of different values is only n³.

Thus, by taking advantage of the fact that every number is a multiple of d, we can sort the array efficiently using counting sort (or bucket sort).

In summary, the proposed algorithm is:

 Algorithm SortMultiples(A, h, n):
  1. d ← 2ⁿ / n³
  2. Allocate an array C[0 … n³] with all entries 0.
  3. For i from 0 to h – 1 do:
    index ← A[i] / d    // This is an exact integer division.
    C[index] ← C[index] + 1
  4. (Either do a cumulative sum on C to use the standard counting sort placement, or simply scan C from index 0 to n³ and output the numbers in sorted order, each value index output C[index] times, multiplied by d.)

This gives an overall time complexity of O(h + n³), which is very efficient given the constraints.
