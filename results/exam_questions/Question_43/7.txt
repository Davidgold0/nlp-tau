Question: \textbf{We will implement a binary counter with $n$ bits. The counter is initialized to the value $0 \ldots 00$. The Inc operation advances the counter, meaning it increases its value by 1 as follows. The operation sequentially searches for the rightmost 0, turns it into a 1, and converts all 1's to its right into 0's. If the counter's state is $1 \ldots 11$, then advancing it will change its state to $00 \ldots 0$. For example, if $n=5$ and the counter state is currently $00111$, then after the Inc operation the counter state will be $01000$. After another Inc operation, the counter state will be $01001$. The cost of an operation is defined as the number of bits whose value is changed by the operation. For instance, the cost of advancing the counter in the example from $00111$ to $01000$ is 4, as 4 bits changed their value. The answers to the following sections need to be precise, not asymptotic in terms of $O(.)$. We will define a Double-Inc operation that calls for two consecutive Inc operations. What is the cost of the Double-Inc operation in the worst case? Explain.}
3o-mini: Recall that our Inc operation works as follows: To increment the counter, we scan from the right until we encounter the first 0, then flip that 0 to a 1 and change all the 1’s to its right into 0’s. (If the counter is all 1’s, then the operation resets the counter to all 0’s.) The cost of an Inc operation is the number of bits that have their value changed. Thus, if there are r trailing 1’s in the current state, the operation will flip those r bits (from 1’s to 0’s) and one additional 0 (to a 1), for a total cost of r + 1.

Now, a Double-Inc operation is simply two consecutive Inc operations.

Consider these two cases:

1. If the counter is in its worst-case configuration for Inc—namely, it has all 1’s—the first Inc will have r = n (since every bit is 1) and so will flip all n bits, resetting the counter to all 0’s. The cost of that Inc is n. Then the second Inc, starting from 00…0, will simply flip the rightmost 0 to 1 (with no trailing 1’s to reset) and cost 1. Thus, the total cost is n + 1.

2. If the counter is not all 1’s but ends with a long string of 1’s, say with r = n – 1 trailing 1’s, then the first Inc will cost (n – 1) + 1 = n. However, in this case the first Inc will change a bit in the middle (not the least-significant bit), so after the operation the new counter state will have trailing 0’s. A following Inc will then cost only 1 (since no trailing 1’s exist). Again, the total is n + 1.

Thus, in both potential worst-case scenarios the cost for a Double-Inc is at most n + 1 bit-flips.

Answer: The Double-Inc operation has a worst-case cost of n + 1 bit changes.
