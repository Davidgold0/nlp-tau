Question: **In this question, we will discuss the Quicksort algorithm. Throughout the question, we assume the input is an array of length \( n \), and we are interested only in arrays where all elements are distinct. As is known, each sorting algorithm has an associated binary tree that represents the comparisons the algorithm performs for all possible inputs.**

We are interested in the Quicksort algorithm where the pivot element is always chosen to be the first element of the segment of the array the algorithm is working on (rather than being chosen randomly), and we will focus on the comparison tree corresponding to this algorithm.

**(A) What is the smallest depth of a leaf in this comparison tree as a function of \( n \)?**
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down what the problem is asking. We want to find the smallest depth among the leaves in the binary comparison tree of the Quicksort algorithm when the pivot is always chosen as the first element of the segment. In other words, we wish to determine, as a function of n (the length of the array), what is the fewest number of comparisons (or decisions) that an input can lead to in the execution of this Quicksort.

To approach this, consider the following steps:

1. First, rephrase the problem in your own words: We need to identify, over all possible orderings of n distinct elements, the minimum total number of comparisons that the algorithm makes (which is the depth of the corresponding leaf in the decision tree).

2. Think about what happens during one recursive call of Quicksort. The algorithm always picks the first element as the pivot and then compares it with every other element in that segment. So, what is the number of comparisons at this first call?

3. Next, consider the input that minimizes the total work. In the best-case scenario, you’d want the pivot to “split” the array as evenly as possible. With an even split, the recursion proceeds on two roughly equal subarrays. Set up a recurrence relation that models the minimum number of comparisons T(n) needed in such a best-case.

4. Finally, solve that recurrence (or at least state its order of growth) to express the smallest depth of a leaf as a function of n.

Let’s start with step 2: In the initial call to Quicksort on an array of size n, how many comparisons do you perform? Please explain your reasoning and provide just the answer for this step.
Student: In the initial call to Quicksort on an array of size \( n \), the algorithm compares the first element (the pivot) with each of the other \( n - 1 \) elements in the array. Therefore, the number of comparisons performed in this first call is \( n - 1 \).
Teacher: That's a great start! You're absolutely correct—when you first call Quicksort on an array of size n, you compare the pivot with the other n – 1 elements, so you perform n – 1 comparisons.

Now, let’s move on to the next step. Consider the scenario that minimizes the total number of comparisons in the subsequent recursive calls. In the best-case scenario, the pivot divides the array as evenly as possible, leading to two balanced subarrays. 

Could you set up a recurrence relation to describe the smallest depth T(n) of a leaf in the comparison tree, based on this best-case split? Please explain your reasoning, focusing just on formulating this recurrence.
Student: In the best-case scenario for the Quicksort algorithm, when we choose the first element as the pivot, we want the pivot to split the array as evenly as possible. 

In the initial call to Quicksort on an array of size \( n \), we perform \( n - 1 \) comparisons. After the pivot is chosen and comparisons are made, the array is split into two subarrays. To achieve the best-case scenario, we ideally want each of these subarrays to be of approximately equal size. 

If we assume that the pivot divides the array into two subarrays of sizes \( k \) and \( n - 1 - k \), the best-case scenario would occur when \( k \) is close to \( \frac{n-1}{2} \). For simplicity, we can denote this as \( \frac{n}{2} \) for a large \( n \).

Thus, after the first call, we proceed with two recursive calls on subarrays of size approximately \( \frac{n}{2} \). Therefore, we can express the recurrence relation for the minimum number of comparisons \( T(n) \) as follows:

\[
T(n) = (n - 1) + T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
T(n) = n - 1 + 2T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)
\]

This recurrence relation captures the total number of comparisons made in the best-case scenario, where the pivot splits the array into two balanced halves.
Teacher: Okay, so you set up a recurrence based on the idea that in the best-case scenario the pivot splits the array evenly, leading to balanced subarrays. However, for the smallest depth leaf in the comparison tree you only follow the branch that eventually ends with an empty call (the leaf), not both branches. That is, at the root you perform (n – 1) comparisons, and then the best you can do is follow one of the two recursive calls—the one where the recursion finishes faster. In a balanced split, both subarrays are roughly of size n/2, so the recurrence for the minimal depth D(n) would be

  D(n) = (n – 1) + D(n/2)

with the base case D(1) = 0. 

Now, your next task is to simplify this recurrence—to find a closed-form or asymptotic expression for D(n). 

Take this one step at a time: Could you solve or simplify the recurrence D(n) = (n – 1) + D(n/2) for n a power of 2 (so that division by 2 is exact), and explain your reasoning? Please share your work for just this step.
Student: To solve the recurrence \( D(n) = (n - 1) + D(n/2) \) for \( n \) being a power of 2, we can start by expanding the recurrence step by step.

1. **Base Case**: We know that \( D(1) = 0 \).

2. **First Expansion**:
   \[
   D(n) = (n - 1) + D(n/2)
   \]

3. **Second Expansion**:
   Now, we substitute \( D(n/2) \):
   \[
   D(n/2) = \left(\frac{n}{2} - 1\right) + D(n/4)
   \]
   Substituting this back into the first equation gives:
   \[
   D(n) = (n - 1) + \left(\frac{n}{2} - 1\right) + D(n/4)
   \]
   Simplifying this:
   \[
   D(n) = n - 1 + \frac{n}{2} - 1 + D(n/4) = n - 2 + \frac{n}{2} + D(n/4)
   \]

4. **Third Expansion**:
   Now we substitute \( D(n/4) \):
   \[
   D(n/4) = \left(\frac{n}{4} - 1\right) + D(n/8)
   \]
   Substituting this back gives:
   \[
   D(n) = n - 2 + \frac{n}{2} + \left(\frac{n}{4} - 1\right) + D(n/8)
   \]
   Simplifying this:
   \[
   D(n) = n - 2 + \frac{n}{2} + \frac{n}{4} - 1 + D(n/8) = n - 3 + \frac{n}{2} + \frac{n}{4} + D(n/8)
   \]

5. **General Pattern**:
   Continuing this process, we can see a pattern forming. Each time we expand, we add:
   - \( n - k \) (where \( k \) is the number of expansions),
   - plus a fraction of \( n \) which decreases as we divide by 2.

6. **Summing Up**:
   After \( k \) expansions, we will have:
   \[
   D(n) = (n - k) + \left(\frac{n}{2} + \frac{n}{4} + \frac{n}{8} + \ldots\right) + D(n/2^k)
   \]
   The series \( \frac{n}{2} + \frac{n}{4} + \frac{n}{8} + \ldots \) is a geometric series that converges to \( n \) when \( k \) approaches \( \log_2(n) \).

7. **Base Case Application**:
   Eventually, when \( n/2^k = 1 \), we have \( k = \log_2(n) \). Therefore, we can substitute this back into our equation:
   \[
   D(n) = n - \log_2(n) - 1 + n = 2n - \log_2(n) - 1
   \]

8. **Final Expression**:
   Since we are interested in the asymptotic behavior, we can drop the constants and lower order terms. Thus, we find:
   \[
   D(n) = O(n)
   \]

This means the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree for the Quicksort algorithm, when the pivot is always the first element, is \( O(n) \).
Teacher: Okay, you're making good progress by expanding the recurrence. I see that you expanded D(n) = (n – 1) + D(n/2) several times and noted a pattern. Before we move on, let's carefully check the expansion and sum the terms in a systematic way.

We have D(n) = (n – 1) + D(n/2) with D(1) = 0. Assume n is a power of 2 (say, n = 2ᵏ for some k). If you expand the recurrence completely, you obtain a series that sums terms from each expansion step. One way to proceed is to write:

  D(2ᵏ) = (2ᵏ – 1) + (2ᵏ⁻¹ – 1) + (2ᵏ⁻² – 1) + … + (2¹ – 1) + D(1).

Since D(1) = 0, the sum becomes

  D(2ᵏ) = (2ᵏ + 2ᵏ⁻¹ + 2ᵏ⁻² + … + 2) – k.

Because the geometric series 2ᵏ + 2ᵏ⁻¹ + … + 2 sums to 2⁽ᵏ⁺¹⁾ – 2, you get

  D(2ᵏ) = [2⁽ᵏ⁺¹⁾ – 2] – k.

In terms of n (recalling n = 2ᵏ), this becomes

  D(n) = 2n – 2 – log₂(n).

Your answer of 2n – log₂(n) – 1 is very close. Please check the constant terms carefully to see if you agree with the derivation above. 

Could you revise your calculation and let me know what expression you obtain? Please explain your summation steps clearly.
Student: To revise my calculation of the recurrence \( D(n) = (n - 1) + D(n/2) \) and express it in terms of powers of 2, let’s follow the teacher's guidance step by step:

1. **Base Case**: We know that \( D(1) = 0 \).

2. **Assumption**: Let’s assume \( n \) is a power of 2, say \( n = 2^k \).

3. **Expanding the Recurrence**:
   We can expand \( D(2^k) \) as follows:
   \[
   D(2^k) = (2^k - 1) + D(2^{k-1})
   \]
   Next, we expand \( D(2^{k-1}) \):
   \[
   D(2^{k-1}) = (2^{k-1} - 1) + D(2^{k-2})
   \]
   Continuing this expansion, we have:
   \[
   D(2^{k-2}) = (2^{k-2} - 1) + D(2^{k-3})
   \]
   Continuing this process down to \( D(1) \):
   \[
   D(2^{k-3}) = (2^{k-3} - 1) + D(1)
   \]

4. **Summing the Terms**:
   When we sum all of these expansions together, we get:
   \[
   D(2^k) = (2^k - 1) + (2^{k-1} - 1) + (2^{k-2} - 1) + \cdots + (2^1 - 1) + D(1)
   \]
   Since \( D(1) = 0 \), we can ignore that term. The sum becomes:
   \[
   D(2^k) = (2^k + 2^{k-1} + 2^{k-2} + \cdots + 2^1) - k
   \]

5. **Calculating the Geometric Series**:
   The series \( 2^k + 2^{k-1} + 2^{k-2} + \cdots + 2^1 \) is a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = a \frac{(r^n - 1)}{r - 1}
   \]
   where \( a \) is the first term, \( r \) is the common ratio, and \( n \) is the number of terms. Here, \( a = 2 \), \( r = 2 \), and there are \( k \) terms:
   \[
   S = 2 \frac{(2^k - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2(2^k - 1) = 2^{k+1} - 2
   \]

6. **Final Expression**:
   Substituting this back into our sum, we have:
   \[
   D(2^k) = (2^{k+1} - 2) - k
   \]
   Recalling that \( n = 2^k \), we can express \( k \) as \( k = \log_2(n) \):
   \[
   D(n) = 2n - 2 - \log_2(n)
   \]

Thus, the corrected expression for the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree for the Quicksort algorithm, when the pivot is always the first element, is:
\[
D(n) = 2n - 2 - \log_2(n)
\]

This provides a more precise representation of the number of comparisons made in the best-case scenario. Thank you for your guidance, and I hope this revised calculation aligns with your expectations!
Teacher: Great work revising your calculation! Let’s review your steps together:

1. You correctly expressed the recurrence for n = 2ᵏ as  
  D(2ᵏ) = (2ᵏ – 1) + (2ᵏ⁻¹ – 1) + … + (2¹ – 1)  
2. You then summed the geometric series 2ᵏ + 2ᵏ⁻¹ + … + 2, which gives (2^(k+1) – 2), and subtracted k (the number of –1’s) to obtain  
  D(2ᵏ) = (2^(k+1) – 2) – k.
3. Finally, converting back to n by using k = log₂(n), you arrived at  
  D(n) = 2n – 2 – log₂(n).

Your revision correctly mirrors the summation approach suggested. Before we move to any concluding remarks or further questions, could you please reconfirm that you understand each term and how the series was summed? Feel free to explain one part of the derivation that you find most interesting or crucial.
Student: Student: Yes, I confirm that I understand each term and how the series was summed. 

The most interesting part of the derivation for me was the use of the geometric series to sum the terms of the expansions. Specifically, I found it fascinating how the series \( 2^k + 2^{k-1} + \ldots + 2^1 \) can be simplified using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. 

The key steps are:

1. **Identifying the Series**: Recognizing that the series formed by the terms of the expansions is geometric, with the first term being \( 2^1 \) and the common ratio being \( 2 \).

2. **Applying the Geometric Series Formula**: Using the formula \( S = a \frac{(r^n - 1)}{r - 1} \) allowed me to quickly calculate the sum without having to add each term individually. This approach made it clear that the sum converges to \( 2^{k+1} - 2 \).

3. **Combining with the Recursive Terms**: Finally, subtracting \( k \) from the geometric sum to account for the \( -1 \) terms from each expansion was crucial in arriving at the correct expression for \( D(n) \).

I appreciate the guidance through this process, as it helped reinforce my understanding of both the Quicksort algorithm's comparison tree and the mathematical techniques involved in solving such recurrences. If there are any further questions or areas to explore, I’m ready to continue!
Teacher: You've done an excellent job working through the process! To summarize our discussion:

• We began by noting that in the initial Quicksort call on an array of size n, the pivot is compared with n – 1 other elements.

• Next, we focused on finding the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree by considering only one branch of the recursion (since we follow the branch that minimizes the comparisons). This led us to form the recurrence:

  D(n) = (n – 1) + D(n/2), with D(1) = 0.

• Assuming n is a power of 2 (n = 2ᵏ), we expanded the recurrence as:
  D(2ᵏ) = (2ᵏ – 1) + (2ᵏ⁻¹ – 1) + … + (2¹ – 1),
which, upon regrouping, becomes:
  D(2ᵏ) = (2ᵏ + 2ᵏ⁻¹ + … + 2) – k.

• Recognizing that 2ᵏ + 2ᵏ⁻¹ + … + 2 forms a geometric series whose sum is 2^(k+1) – 2, and substituting k = log₂(n), we obtained:
  D(n) = 2n – 2 – log₂(n).

Thus, the final expression for the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree for this version of Quicksort is:
2n – 2 – log₂(n)$
