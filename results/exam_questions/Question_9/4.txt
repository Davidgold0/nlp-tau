Question: **In this question, we will discuss the Quicksort algorithm. Throughout the question, we assume the input is an array of length \( n \), and we are interested only in arrays where all elements are distinct. As is known, each sorting algorithm has an associated binary tree that represents the comparisons the algorithm performs for all possible inputs.**

We are interested in the Quicksort algorithm where the pivot element is always chosen to be the first element of the segment of the array the algorithm is working on (rather than being chosen randomly), and we will focus on the comparison tree corresponding to this algorithm.

**(A) What is the smallest depth of a leaf in this comparison tree as a function of \( n \)?**
Teacher: Let’s begin by understanding the problem together. We are considering Quicksort where the pivot is always chosen as the first element. The “comparison tree” is a binary tree where each leaf represents an execution path (that is, the sequence of comparisons made) for some input permutation, and the depth of a leaf is the number of comparisons made on that input. The question asks: How does the minimum (smallest) leaf depth – that is, the fewest comparisons that can ever occur – depend on n?

A good first step is to think about what sort of input would lead Quicksort to perform as few comparisons as possible. In other words, what input ordering would give you the “best‐case” for this version of Quicksort?

To help you get started:
• Recall that the first element (the pivot) is fixed in each recursive call.
• When partitioning, the algorithm always compares the pivot to every other element in the subarray.
• How might you arrange the input so that the subsequent recursive calls “finish” quickly (that is, so that the sizes of the subarrays are as balanced as possible)?

Step 1: Please explain—in your own words—what input arrangement would lead to the best-case scenario for Quicksort (with the pivot always chosen as the first element). What is the effect on the two recursive calls (the two “subproblems”) when you arrange the input in an optimal way?
Student: To achieve the best-case scenario for Quicksort, where the pivot is always the first element, we need to arrange the input in such a way that the pivot effectively partitions the array into two nearly equal halves. 

In this case, the ideal input arrangement would be a sorted array (in increasing order). When the first element is chosen as the pivot, it will be the smallest element in the array. During the partitioning process, all other elements will be compared to this pivot. Since they are all larger than the pivot, they will all be placed in the right subarray, and the left subarray will be empty.

This leads to the following effects on the two recursive calls:
1. The left subarray will have a size of 0 (since there are no elements smaller than the pivot).
2. The right subarray will contain all the other elements, which means the next recursive call will be on an array of size \( n-1 \).

This pattern continues, where each time we select the first element as the pivot, we will always end up with a left subarray of size 0 and a right subarray that decreases in size by 1 each time. This results in a highly unbalanced partitioning.

In summary, by arranging the input as a sorted array, we create the scenario where the depth of the comparison tree is minimized because we are making only one comparison for each level of recursion until we reach the base case. 

Would you like me to elaborate further on how this leads to the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree?
Teacher: You're making a good start by thinking about how the input affects the pivot’s partitioning. However, let's reflect on the input you described.

When you mentioned arranging the array in increasing order, you correctly noted that the first element would be the smallest. But consider this: if the first element is the smallest, then in the partitioning step every other element will be placed in the right subarray while the left subarray remains empty. Does that lead to a balanced partition that minimizes the depth of the leaf (i.e. the number of comparisons along some execution path)? Think about what we mean by "best-case" here.

The key idea for minimizing the depth of a leaf is to have as few comparisons as possible on some execution path. For that, the recursion should ideally reduce the problem size as quickly as possible—in other words, the pivot should ideally split the array into two roughly equal parts.

Step 1 (Revised): Can you now describe—in your own words—what input arrangement (i.e. what ordering of the array) would allow the first element (the pivot) to act as a good splitter and lead to balanced recursive calls? Please explain what happens to the two subarrays in that situation.
Student: To achieve the best-case scenario for Quicksort, where the pivot is always chosen as the first element, we should arrange the input in such a way that the pivot effectively splits the array into two nearly equal halves. 

The ideal input arrangement for this would be a situation where the first element (the pivot) is chosen in such a way that it is roughly the median of the array. However, since we are restricted to choosing the first element as the pivot, we can think of a specific ordering that helps create balanced partitions.

One effective way to achieve this is to arrange the array in a way that the first element is a value that is neither the smallest nor the largest in the array. For example, if we take an array of distinct elements and sort it, we could select the middle element of the sorted array and place it at the start, followed by the elements less than it and then the elements greater than it. 

For instance, if we have an array like [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], we could rearrange it to [3, 1, 2, 4, 5] (where 3 is the pivot). When we perform the partitioning, 3 will be compared to all other elements. The smaller elements (1 and 2) will go to the left subarray, and the larger elements (4 and 5) will go to the right subarray.

In this case, the effects on the two recursive calls would be:
1. The left subarray will contain 2 elements (1 and 2).
2. The right subarray will contain 2 elements (4 and 5).

This leads to a balanced partitioning where both subarrays are of similar size. As a result, this allows the recursion to reduce the problem size more efficiently, minimizing the depth of the comparison tree.

In summary, by choosing a pivot that is closer to the median value of the array (even if we have to rearrange the array to achieve that), we can ensure that the pivot splits the array into two balanced parts, leading to fewer comparisons and thus minimizing the depth of the leaf in the comparison tree. Would you like me to explain how this leads to the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree mathematically?
Teacher: Great explanation so far! Now that we've agreed on the optimal input arrangement—one where the first element is roughly the median so that the array splits into two nearly equal halves—we can move to the next step.

Step 2: Please set up a recurrence relation that expresses the smallest depth of a leaf (i.e., the minimal number of comparisons along some execution path) as a function of n, using this balanced partition idea. What recurrence would you write, and why?
Student: To set up the recurrence relation for the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree for Quicksort, we can use the insights we've gathered about how the pivot splits the array.

Given that we want to minimize the number of comparisons, we will assume that the pivot (the first element) splits the array into two nearly equal-sized subarrays. If we denote the smallest depth of a leaf for an array of size \( n \) as \( T(n) \), we can express this as follows:

1. The first comparison is made when selecting the pivot. This counts as 1 comparison.
2. After the first comparison, the array is partitioned into two subarrays. If we assume the pivot splits the array into two equal halves, each subarray will have approximately \( \frac{n-1}{2} \) elements (since we have already used one element as the pivot).

Thus, the recurrence relation can be set up as:

\[
T(n) = T\left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right) + T\left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right) + 1
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
T(n) = 2T\left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right) + 1
\]

This relation captures the fact that we make one comparison for the pivot, and then we recursively solve for both subarrays. 

However, since we are dealing with a binary tree structure and the sizes of the subarrays can vary slightly based on the exact split, we can also express it as:

\[
T(n) = T(k) + T(n-k-1) + 1
\]

where \( k \) represents the size of the left subarray and \( n-k-1 \) represents the size of the right subarray. For the best case, we can assume \( k \) is approximately \( \frac{n}{2} \).

Now, we can analyze the depth of the tree. Each level of recursion corresponds to a comparison, and the depth of the tree will be related to how many times we can halve the array until we reach the base case (which is when the size of the array is 1).

To summarize, the recurrence relation expressing the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree for Quicksort, with a balanced partitioning strategy, is:

\[
T(n) = 2T\left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right) + 1
\]

Would you like to proceed to solve this recurrence relation to find the smallest depth of a leaf as a function of \( n \)?
Teacher: Great work so far! Your recurrence T(n) = 2T((n – 1)/2) + 1 is a natural way to account for both recursive calls, but remember that we’re interested in the smallest depth among the leaves—that is, the depth along a single branch that terminates as early as possible.

Since the optimal input arrangement makes the pivot roughly the median, both recursive calls will have roughly the same size. In this case, the smallest depth is contributed by following just one branch rather than summing the contributions from both. Essentially, after performing the comparisons at the current level (a constant cost, here represented as 1), you only need to follow the branch with roughly half the elements.

Step 2 (Revised): Could you now set up a recurrence relation for the smallest depth (i.e. the minimal number of comparisons along one execution path) using this balanced partition idea? Keep in mind that you only add the cost of the current pivot’s partitioning (say 1) plus the minimal depth of one of the half-sized subproblems. What recurrence would you write for D(n), where D(n) represents the smallest depth of a leaf, and why?
Student: To set up the correct recurrence relation for the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree for Quicksort, we need to focus on the fact that we are only following one branch of the recursion tree, which corresponds to the best-case scenario where the pivot effectively splits the array into two nearly equal halves.

Let’s denote \( D(n) \) as the smallest depth of a leaf for an array of size \( n \). In this case, the structure of our recurrence relation will reflect the following:

1. When we select the pivot (the first element), we make 1 comparison.
2. The pivot splits the array into two subarrays. In the best-case scenario, where the pivot is roughly the median, we would ideally have two subarrays of size approximately \( \frac{n-1}{2} \).
3. Since we are interested in the smallest depth along one execution path, we only need to consider the depth of one of those subarrays.

Thus, the recurrence relation can be expressed as:

\[
D(n) = D\left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right) + 1
\]

This captures the fact that we make 1 comparison for the pivot, and then we recursively solve for the subproblem of size approximately \( \frac{n-1}{2} \). 

This relation is valid because we are only following one branch of the recursion tree, which leads to the smallest depth of a leaf. 

Now, we can analyze this recurrence. The base case occurs when \( n = 1 \), where \( D(1) = 0 \) because no comparisons are needed when there is only one element.

To summarize, the recurrence relation expressing the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree for the best-case scenario of Quicksort is:

\[
D(n) = D\left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right) + 1
\]

This accurately represents the minimal number of comparisons along one execution path. Would you like to proceed with solving this recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution for \( D(n) \)?
Teacher: Great job setting up the recurrence as

  D(n) = D((n – 1)/2) + 1  with the base case D(1) = 0.

Now, let’s solve this recurrence to obtain a closed-form expression for D(n). To do this, consider how many times you must apply the recurrence until you reach the base case. In other words, set up an expression for the number of times (say, k steps) that you can halve the array (approximately) before you reach an array of size 1.

Step 3: Please try to determine how many times you can apply the recurrence (i.e. find an expression for k such that after k steps you reach D(1)). How does k relate to n? Explain your reasoning (for example, by writing an equation expressing when the term inside D(·) becomes 1).
Student: To determine how many times we can apply the recurrence \( D(n) = D\left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right) + 1 \) until we reach the base case \( D(1) = 0 \), we need to analyze how the size of the array decreases with each recursive call.

Starting with an initial size \( n \), we can express the size of the array after \( k \) applications of the recurrence as follows:

1. After the first step: \( n_1 = \frac{n - 1}{2} \)
2. After the second step: \( n_2 = \frac{n_1 - 1}{2} = \frac{\frac{n - 1}{2} - 1}{2} = \frac{n - 3}{4} \)
3. After the third step: \( n_3 = \frac{n_2 - 1}{2} = \frac{\frac{n - 3}{4} - 1}{2} = \frac{n - 7}{8} \)

Continuing this pattern, we can generalize the size of the array after \( k \) steps as:

\[
n_k = \frac{n - (2^k - 1)}{2^k}
\]

We want to find \( k \) such that \( n_k \) becomes 1, which leads us to the equation:

\[
\frac{n - (2^k - 1)}{2^k} = 1
\]

Multiplying both sides by \( 2^k \) gives:

\[
n - (2^k - 1) = 2^k
\]

Rearranging this leads to:

\[
n = 2 \cdot 2^k - 1
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
n + 1 = 2^{k + 1}
\]

Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides gives us:

\[
k + 1 = \log_2(n + 1)
\]

Thus, we find:

\[
k = \log_2(n + 1) - 1
\]

This indicates that the number of steps \( k \) required to reach the base case \( D(1) \) is approximately \( \log_2(n + 1) - 1 \). 

In summary, we can conclude that the number of times we can apply the recurrence until we reach the base case relates to \( n \) through the expression \( k = \log_2(n + 1) - 1 \). 

Would you like to proceed to express \( D(n) \) in terms of \( n \) using this value of \( k \)?
Teacher: Great work on deriving the recurrence for the number of steps, k. Let’s recap what you found:

You determined that after k applications of the recurrence, the size of the subproblem is

  n_k = (n – (2^k – 1)) / 2^k.

Setting n_k = 1, you obtained

  (n – (2^k – 1)) / 2^k = 1  ⟹  n – (2^k – 1) = 2^k  
  ⟹  n + 1 = 2^(k+1).

Taking logarithms gave

  k + 1 = log₂(n + 1)  ⟹  k = log₂(n + 1) – 1.

Now, recall that in our recurrence, each recursive application adds 1 to D(n). Since D(1) = 0, after k steps we expect

  D(n) = k.

Step 3 (Your Turn): Based on the work you just done, can you now express D(n) in closed form as a function of n using k = log₂(n + 1) – 1? Please provide your answer and explain your reasoning briefly.
Student: To express \( D(n) \) in closed form as a function of \( n \), we can use the relationship we established between \( D(n) \) and \( k \).

From our previous work, we found that after \( k \) applications of the recurrence, we have:

\[
D(n) = k.
\]

We also derived that:

\[
k = \log_2(n + 1) - 1.
\]

Substituting this expression for \( k \) into our equation for \( D(n) \), we get:

\[
D(n) = \log_2(n + 1) - 1.
\]

This means that the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree for the best-case scenario of Quicksort (where the pivot is chosen as the first element and the array is arranged to allow for balanced partitioning) is given by:

\[
D(n) = \log_2(n + 1) - 1.
\]

**Reasoning:**
- Each recursive call contributes 1 to the depth.
- The number of recursive calls needed to reduce the problem size down to 1 (the base case) is approximately \( \log_2(n + 1) - 1 \).
- Thus, the total depth (or the minimum number of comparisons along one execution path) is directly tied to how many times we can halve the problem size until we reach the base case.

In summary, the closed-form expression for the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree for this version of Quicksort is:

\[
D(n) = \log_2(n + 1) - 1.
\]

Would you like to discuss any further implications or details about this result?
Teacher: You've done a great job working through the recurrence and deriving an expression for k in terms of n. To recap, we started with the recurrence

  D(n) = D((n – 1)/2) + 1  with the base case D(1) = 0,

which reflects that at each step we add one comparison and then follow just one of the two (balanced) branches. By determining that after k steps the array size reduces to 1, we found that

  (n – (2^k – 1)) / 2^k = 1  ⟹  n + 1 = 2^(k+1),

and therefore

  k = log₂(n + 1) – 1.

Since each step adds 1 to the depth, we deduced that

  D(n) = k = log₂(n + 1) – 1.

Your explanation is clear and well-reasoned. 

Final answer:
D(n) = log₂(n + 1) – 1$
