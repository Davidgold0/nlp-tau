Question: **In this question, we will discuss the Quicksort algorithm. Throughout the question, we assume the input is an array of length \( n \), and we are interested only in arrays where all elements are distinct. As is known, each sorting algorithm has an associated binary tree that represents the comparisons the algorithm performs for all possible inputs.**

We are interested in the Quicksort algorithm where the pivot element is always chosen to be the first element of the segment of the array the algorithm is working on (rather than being chosen randomly), and we will focus on the comparison tree corresponding to this algorithm.

**(A) What is the smallest depth of a leaf in this comparison tree as a function of \( n \)?**
Teacher: Let's begin by breaking down the problem into clear steps. We need to find the smallest depth (that is, the minimum number of comparisons along any branch from the root to a leaf) in the comparison tree generated by Quicksort when the pivot is always the first element.

Here’s a suggested outline of the steps we might take:

1. Rephrase the problem in your own words. Since the pivot is always the first element, think about how that decision influences the partitioning of the array.
2. Understand how the comparisons form a binary tree: each node represents a comparison involving a pivot, and the leaves represent final outcomes (sorted order after all necessary comparisons are made).
3. Consider small values of n to observe the structure of the tree and see if you can recognize a pattern regarding the depth of the leaves.
4. Identify which branch of the tree might have the smallest depth—this may correspond to a scenario where you finish sorting one part of the array very quickly.
5. Generalize your observations from the small examples to an arbitrary n.

Now, please start with the first step: In your own words, can you explain how using the first element as the pivot affects the way the algorithm partitions the array? (Think about what happens when you pick the first element and how the rest of the array is split.) What are your thoughts on this?
Student: Sure! When we use the first element of the array as the pivot in the Quicksort algorithm, it significantly influences how the array is partitioned. 

1. **Partitioning Process**: The first element is compared with all other elements in the array to determine which elements are less than or greater than the pivot. This means that the elements that are smaller than the pivot will be moved to the left side, and those that are greater will be moved to the right side.

2. **Effect on Array Structure**: If the array is already sorted in ascending order, the first element will be the smallest, and all comparisons will place the other elements to the right. This results in a highly unbalanced partition: one side (the left) will have zero elements, and the other side (the right) will have \( n-1 \) elements. 

3. **Comparison Tree**: In this scenario, the depth of the comparison tree will increase because we will have to make \( n-1 \) comparisons to sort the right side, leading to deeper branches in the tree.

4. **Best Case**: Conversely, if the first element is the largest in the array, all other elements will be placed to the left, again leading to an unbalanced partition. 

Overall, using the first element as the pivot can lead to very unbalanced partitions, especially when the array is already sorted or nearly sorted, which affects the depth of the leaves in the comparison tree. 

Next, should I look at small values of \( n \) to see how this affects the depth of the leaves in the comparison tree?
Teacher: Great explanation! Now let's move to the next step in our process. We want to analyze small examples to understand the structure of the comparison tree better. 

For instance, consider an array of length n = 2. Can you describe or sketch the comparison tree for this case and identify the depth of its leaves? Please work through this small example step by step and tell me your reasoning.
Student: Student: Sure! Let's analyze the case where \( n = 2 \). 

1. **Array Example**: Let's consider the array \( [a_1, a_2] \) where \( a_1 \) is the first element (the pivot) and \( a_2 \) is the second element.

2. **Choosing the Pivot**: Since the pivot is always the first element, we choose \( a_1 \) as the pivot. 

3. **Partitioning**: We compare \( a_1 \) with \( a_2 \):
   - If \( a_1 < a_2 \), then \( a_1 \) stays in its position, and \( a_2 \) is placed to the right.
   - If \( a_1 > a_2 \), then \( a_1 \) stays in its position, and \( a_2 \) is placed to the left.

4. **Comparison Tree**: In either case, we only have one comparison, which leads to a sorted array:
   - If \( a_1 < a_2 \): The array remains \( [a_1, a_2] \).
   - If \( a_1 > a_2 \): The array becomes \( [a_2, a_1] \).

5. **Depth of Leaves**: In this case, we only have one level of comparison before reaching the leaves (the sorted arrays). Thus, the depth of the leaves in the comparison tree is \( 1 \).

So for \( n = 2 \), the comparison tree has a depth of \( 1 \).

Now, should I proceed to analyze the case for \( n = 3 \) to see how the depth of the leaves changes?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've clearly worked through the n = 2 case. Now let's consider the next step: analyzing the situation for n = 3.

For an array of three elements with the first element as the pivot, please work through the following:

1. Describe how the pivot (first element) partitions the array.
2. Explain what comparisons are made, and sketch the structure of the comparison tree.
3. Identify the branch (or branches) in this tree that could potentially yield the smallest depth (i.e., the fewest comparisons before reaching a leaf).

Please provide your reasoning for n = 3, and let's discuss your approach.
Student: Sure! Let's analyze the case where \( n = 3 \).

1. **Array Example**: Let's consider the array \( [a_1, a_2, a_3] \), where \( a_1 \) is the pivot (the first element).

2. **Choosing the Pivot**: Since \( a_1 \) is the pivot, we compare it with the other elements \( a_2 \) and \( a_3 \).

3. **Partitioning**:
   - We compare \( a_1 \) with \( a_2 \):
     - If \( a_1 < a_2 \), we then compare \( a_1 \) with \( a_3 \):
       - If \( a_1 < a_3 \), the array remains \( [a_1, a_2, a_3] \) (sorted).
       - If \( a_1 > a_3 \), the array becomes \( [a_3, a_1, a_2] \) (after placing \( a_3 \) at the front).
     - If \( a_1 > a_2 \), we then compare \( a_1 \) with \( a_3 \):
       - If \( a_1 < a_3 \), the array becomes \( [a_2, a_1, a_3] \) (after placing \( a_2 \) at the front).
       - If \( a_1 > a_3 \), the array becomes \( [a_3, a_2, a_1] \) (after placing both \( a_2 \) and \( a_3 \) in front of \( a_1 \)).

4. **Comparison Tree Structure**:
   - The first comparison is between \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \). This leads to two branches:
     - **Left Branch**: \( a_1 < a_2 \)
       - Second comparison: \( a_1 \) vs \( a_3 \).
         - If \( a_1 < a_3 \), we reach a leaf with depth 2.
         - If \( a_1 > a_3 \), we reach another leaf with depth 2.
     - **Right Branch**: \( a_1 > a_2 \)
       - Second comparison: \( a_1 \) vs \( a_3 \).
         - If \( a_1 < a_3 \), we reach a leaf with depth 2.
         - If \( a_1 > a_3 \), we reach another leaf with depth 2.

5. **Identifying the Branches**:
   - In all cases, we see that the depth of the leaves is consistently 2, as it takes two comparisons to sort the three elements regardless of their initial order.

So, for \( n = 3 \), the comparison tree has a depth of \( 2 \). 

Would you like me to analyze the case for \( n = 4 \) next, or is there anything else you'd like to discuss about the \( n = 3 \) case?
Teacher: Your analysis for n = 3 is a good start, and I can see you’re thinking through the comparisons and the structure of the tree carefully. However, let’s reflect a little more on the details.

Recall that the comparison tree is built by the comparisons performed during the partitioning steps. Sometimes one branch of the partition might be empty (or immediately sorted), and that branch is represented by a leaf reached without additional comparisons.

Before moving on, let’s revisit your reasoning for n = 3. You described the two comparisons (a₁ versus a₂ and a₁ versus a₃) and then said that all branches end at depth 2. I’d like you to consider the following:

• Is it possible for any branch to “end” (i.e., reach a leaf) without performing both comparisons in the initial partition? In other words, might there be a scenario in which one branch is immediately terminated (an empty subarray) and that leaf is reached with fewer comparisons than 2?

Please re-examine the process for n = 3 with this in mind. Which branch might yield the smallest depth, and what would that depth be? Take your time and share your revised reasoning on this step.
Student: Thank you for your guidance! Let me re-examine the case for \( n = 3 \) with your suggestions in mind.

1. **Array Example**: We still have the array \( [a_1, a_2, a_3] \), where \( a_1 \) is the pivot.

2. **Choosing the Pivot**: As before, we compare \( a_1 \) with \( a_2 \) and \( a_3 \).

3. **Partitioning**:
   - If \( a_1 < a_2 \):
     - We then compare \( a_1 \) with \( a_3 \):
       - If \( a_1 < a_3 \), the array remains \( [a_1, a_2, a_3] \) (sorted). This means we reach a leaf with depth 2.
       - If \( a_1 > a_3 \), the array becomes \( [a_3, a_1, a_2] \) (after placing \( a_3 \) at the front). This also leads to a leaf with depth 2.
   - If \( a_1 > a_2 \):
     - Here, we again compare \( a_1 \) with \( a_3 \):
       - If \( a_1 < a_3 \), the array becomes \( [a_2, a_1, a_3] \) (placing \( a_2 \) in front). This results in a leaf with depth 2.
       - If \( a_1 > a_3 \), the array becomes \( [a_3, a_2, a_1] \) (placing both \( a_2 \) and \( a_3 \) in front of \( a_1 \)). This also leads to a leaf with depth 2.

4. **Identifying Possible Early Leaves**:
   - However, I need to consider the situation where the pivot \( a_1 \) is the smallest element. If \( a_1 < a_2 \) and \( a_1 < a_3 \), then it is already in its correct position after the first comparison with \( a_2 \). In this case, the right side (containing \( a_2 \) and \( a_3 \)) would need to be sorted, but the left side is empty. 

   - This would mean we can reach a leaf after just one comparison (the comparison of \( a_1 \) with \( a_2 \)), because we can immediately determine that \( a_1 \) is less than both \( a_2 \) and \( a_3 \).

5. **Conclusion on Depth**:
   - Therefore, the minimum depth of a leaf in the comparison tree for \( n = 3 \) can indeed be 1 if \( a_1 \) is the smallest element. This means that the depth of the leaves can be either 1 or 2, depending on the values of \( a_2 \) and \( a_3 \).

So, for \( n = 3 \), the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree is \( 1 \) when the pivot is the smallest element. Thank you for prompting me to reconsider the structure of the tree!

Would you like me to analyze the case for \( n = 4 \) next, or is there anything else you'd like to discuss about the \( n = 3 \) case?
Teacher: Let's take another careful look at the process for n = 3. Remember, the comparison tree records every single comparison made by the algorithm. Even if one branch (say, the one representing an empty subarray) “terminates” the recursion immediately after a call, all the comparisons made in that partitioning step still count toward the depth of the leaf.

For n = 3, here’s a brief recap of what happens in one call to partition an array [a₁, a₂, a₃]:

• The algorithm uses a₁ as the pivot and then compares it with a₂ and a₃ in sequence.  
• This means that, regardless of the order in which comparisons might allow you to “know” one branch is empty, both comparisons are executed in the partitioning step.

Now, consider this scenario: suppose a₁ is the smallest element. Then, after comparing a₁ with a₂ and a₁ with a₃, a₁’s left subarray will be empty. Even though the left branch is empty and no recursive call is made on it, the partitioning step itself has already performed 2 comparisons. In the decision tree, the leaf corresponding to that empty left branch is reached after 2 comparisons.

Given this reasoning, what do you now conclude is the smallest depth of a leaf for n = 3? Please explain your revised answer, paying attention to the fact that all comparisons in the partition step count toward the depth.
Student: Thank you for the clarification! I see now that I need to consider all the comparisons made during the partitioning step when determining the depth of the leaves in the comparison tree. Let’s re-evaluate the case for \( n = 3 \) with your guidance in mind.

1. **Array Example**: We are still looking at the array \( [a_1, a_2, a_3] \), where \( a_1 \) is the pivot.

2. **Choosing the Pivot**: The pivot is \( a_1 \), and we will compare it with \( a_2 \) and \( a_3 \).

3. **Partitioning**:
   - First, we compare \( a_1 \) with \( a_2 \):
     - If \( a_1 < a_2 \), we then compare \( a_1 \) with \( a_3 \):
       - If \( a_1 < a_3 \), the array remains \( [a_1, a_2, a_3] \), and we reach a leaf after 2 comparisons.
       - If \( a_1 > a_3 \), the array becomes \( [a_3, a_1, a_2] \), and again we reach a leaf after 2 comparisons.
   - If \( a_1 > a_2 \):
     - We compare \( a_1 \) with \( a_3 \):
       - If \( a_1 < a_3 \), the array becomes \( [a_2, a_1, a_3] \), and we reach a leaf after 2 comparisons.
       - If \( a_1 > a_3 \), the array becomes \( [a_3, a_2, a_1] \), leading to a leaf after 2 comparisons.

4. **Conclusion on Depth**:
   - Regardless of the values of \( a_2 \) and \( a_3 \), we always perform both comparisons (i.e., \( a_1 \) with \( a_2 \) and \( a_1 \) with \( a_3 \)) during the partitioning step. This means that even if the left branch is empty (when \( a_1 \) is the smallest), we still count both comparisons toward the depth of the leaf.

Thus, for \( n = 3 \), the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree is consistently \( 2 \), as both comparisons are executed in every scenario.

Thank you for your patience and for helping me clarify this point! Would you like me to analyze the case for \( n = 4 \) next, or is there anything else you’d like to discuss about the \( n = 3 \) case?
Teacher: Great job re-evaluating the n = 3 case! Your revised explanation makes it clear that every call to partition performs both comparisons, so the minimum leaf depth for n = 3 is indeed 2.

Now, let's move on to the next step. Consider the case when n = 4. Please work through the following questions:

1. Describe how the first element (a₁) is used as the pivot and which elements are compared to it during the partition.
2. Count how many comparisons occur in this initial partitioning step.
3. Sketch or describe the structure of the comparison tree for the partitioning stage when n = 4.
4. Identify the branch that might result in the smallest depth (keeping in mind that all comparisons in the partitioning step count).

Take it one step at a time and share your reasoning on these points. What do you get for n = 4?
Student: Sure! Let's analyze the case for \( n = 4 \) step by step.

1. **Array Example**: We will consider the array \( [a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4] \), where \( a_1 \) is the pivot (the first element).

2. **Choosing the Pivot**: Since \( a_1 \) is the pivot, we will compare it with the other elements \( a_2 \), \( a_3 \), and \( a_4 \) during the partitioning step.

3. **Partitioning Process**:
   - First, we compare \( a_1 \) with \( a_2 \):
     - If \( a_1 < a_2 \), we then compare \( a_1 \) with \( a_3 \):
       - If \( a_1 < a_3 \), we compare \( a_1 \) with \( a_4 \):
         - If \( a_1 < a_4 \), the array remains \( [a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4] \) (sorted).
         - If \( a_1 > a_4 \), the array becomes \( [a_4, a_1, a_2, a_3] \).
       - If \( a_1 > a_3 \), we compare \( a_1 \) with \( a_4 \):
         - If \( a_1 < a_4 \), the array becomes \( [a_3, a_1, a_2, a_4] \).
         - If \( a_1 > a_4 \), the array becomes \( [a_4, a_3, a_1, a_2] \).
   - If \( a_1 > a_2 \):
     - We then compare \( a_1 \) with \( a_3 \):
       - If \( a_1 < a_3 \), we compare \( a_1 \) with \( a_4 \):
         - If \( a_1 < a_4 \), the array becomes \( [a_2, a_1, a_3, a_4] \).
         - If \( a_1 > a_4 \), the array becomes \( [a_4, a_2, a_1, a_3] \).
       - If \( a_1 > a_3 \), we compare \( a_1 \) with \( a_4 \):
         - If \( a_1 < a_4 \), the array becomes \( [a_3, a_2, a_1, a_4] \).
         - If \( a_1 > a_4 \), the array becomes \( [a_4, a_3, a_2, a_1] \).

4. **Counting Comparisons**: In this initial partitioning step, we will always perform 3 comparisons (comparing \( a_1 \) with \( a_2 \), \( a_3 \), and \( a_4 \)) regardless of the order of the elements.

5. **Structure of the Comparison Tree**:
   - The first level of the tree represents the first comparison with \( a_2 \).
   - The second level represents the comparison with \( a_3 \).
   - The third level represents the comparison with \( a_4 \).
   - Each leaf represents a possible sorted order of the array after all comparisons.

6. **Identifying the Branch with the Smallest Depth**: 
   - In every scenario, we perform all 3 comparisons during the partitioning step. Therefore, every leaf in this comparison tree will have a depth of 3.
   - There are no branches that can terminate early without all comparisons being made, as we need to compare \( a_1 \) with all other elements to determine its correct position.

In conclusion, for \( n = 4 \), the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree is \( 3 \), as all comparisons are executed during the partitioning step.

Would you like to proceed with any further analysis or move on to the next part of the question?
Teacher: Great work working through the n = 4 case! Now let’s take a step back and look at the general pattern for an array of length n.

Recall that in each call to partition the array, the algorithm always chooses the first element as the pivot and then compares it with every other element in the current segment. This means that, for an array of n elements, the initial partition step makes n – 1 comparisons regardless of how the elements compare.

At this point, I’d like you to reflect on this process for an arbitrary n. Can you explain how these n – 1 comparisons in the first partitioning call contribute to the overall depth of the leaves in the comparison tree? What pattern do you see emerging based on the examples for n = 2, n = 3, and n = 4, and what would be your conjecture for the smallest depth of a leaf as a function of n?

Take your time to share your reasoning for this next step.
Student: Thank you for your guidance! Let's reflect on the process for an arbitrary \( n \) and how the comparisons in the first partitioning call contribute to the overall depth of the leaves in the comparison tree.

1. **General Case for n Elements**: When we have an array of length \( n \), the first element (the pivot) is compared with each of the other \( n - 1 \) elements in the array during the partitioning step. This means we perform \( n - 1 \) comparisons.

2. **Depth of Comparison Tree**: 
   - Each comparison made during the partitioning step contributes to the depth of the comparison tree. Since we are always making \( n - 1 \) comparisons in the first partitioning call, this sets the initial depth.
   - After the first partitioning, the array is divided into two subarrays (elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot). However, regardless of how the elements are distributed, we will have to go through the \( n - 1 \) comparisons to determine the correct positions of the elements.

3. **Pattern Recognition**: 
   - From our previous cases:
     - For \( n = 2 \), the depth was \( 1 \).
     - For \( n = 3 \), the depth was \( 2 \).
     - For \( n = 4 \), the depth was \( 3 \).
   - It appears that the depth of the leaves corresponds directly to \( n - 1 \) comparisons made in the first partitioning step. This suggests a pattern where the depth increases linearly with \( n \).

4. **Conjecture for Arbitrary n**: 
   - Based on the observations from the smaller cases, we can conjecture that the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree for an array of length \( n \) is \( n - 1 \). This is because, in the first partitioning call, we perform \( n - 1 \) comparisons, and every leaf in the tree will reflect this depth.

In conclusion, the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree for an array of length \( n \) is conjectured to be \( n - 1 \). 

Thank you for guiding me through this reasoning process! Is there anything else you would like to discuss or any further analysis you would like me to perform?
Teacher: You've done a great job working through these examples and recognizing the pattern. Let’s summarize our discussion so far:

1. For n = 2, we noted that one comparison is made (a₁ is compared with a₂), giving a smallest depth of 1.
2. For n = 3, even though there are choices in how the array might branch, the partition procedure always performs 2 comparisons (a₁ is compared with both a₂ and a₃), leading to a smallest leaf depth of 2.
3. For n = 4, the initial partition of the array uses the pivot a₁ and makes 3 comparisons (with a₂, a₃, and a₄), which sets the depth in the decision tree to 3.
4. Observing the pattern in these examples, for an array of length n the first partition always takes n – 1 comparisons. Since every partitioning call in this scenario necessarily carries out all these comparisons, the smallest depth of any leaf (the branch ending after just one full partitioning step) is n – 1.

So your conclusion is that the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree for Quicksort (when the pivot is always the first element) as a function of n is n – 1.

n – 1$
