Question: **In this question, we will discuss the Quicksort algorithm. Throughout the question, we assume the input is an array of length \( n \), and we are interested only in arrays where all elements are distinct. As is known, each sorting algorithm has an associated binary tree that represents the comparisons the algorithm performs for all possible inputs.**

We are interested in the Quicksort algorithm where the pivot element is always chosen to be the first element of the segment of the array the algorithm is working on (rather than being chosen randomly), and we will focus on the comparison tree corresponding to this algorithm.

**(A) What is the smallest depth of a leaf in this comparison tree as a function of \( n \)?**
Teacher: Let’s start by understanding what the question is asking. We need to find, as a function of n, the smallest number of comparisons that Quicksort (with the first‐element pivot rule) might use—that is, the length of the shortest path (leaf) in the binary decision tree that represents the comparisons performed. In other words, we want to find the “best‐case” value (in terms of the number of comparisons) that quicksort could possibly achieve on some input.

To approach this, we can break the work into these steps:

1. Restate the algorithm’s behavior:  
 a. At each call, the algorithm selects the first element as the pivot.  
 b. It then partitions the other n – 1 elements by comparing each to the pivot. This always takes (n – 1) comparisons in that call, regardless of the input order.  
 c. Then the algorithm recursively sorts each of the resulting subarrays (which, in the best case, should “balance” as much as possible so that we keep the recursion “shallow”).

2. Write down a recurrence for the number of comparisons performed in the best case.  
 a. Express T(n) (the minimal number of comparisons on an array of length n) in terms of T(small subarray sizes) plus the (n – 1) comparisons at the current level.

3. Determine what the “best-case” (or most balanced) splits are that minimize the overall number of comparisons; that is, choose sizes for the left and right subarrays that are as equal as possible.

4. Solve (or simplify asymptotically) the recurrence to express the minimal number of comparisons as a function of n. This answer (which corresponds to the smallest leaf depth in the comparison tree) will be your final answer.

Now, let’s begin with step 1: Can you describe in your own words how the quicksort algorithm (with the first-element pivot rule) processes an input array? What happens at the very first call (with an array of n elements)?
Student: Sure! The Quicksort algorithm, when using the first element as the pivot, processes an input array by following these steps:

1. **Choosing the Pivot**: At the very first call, the algorithm takes the first element of the array as the pivot. 

2. **Partitioning**: It then compares each of the other \( n - 1 \) elements in the array to the pivot. During this partitioning step, elements that are less than the pivot are moved to the left, and elements greater than the pivot are moved to the right. This requires \( n - 1 \) comparisons.

3. **Recursive Calls**: After the partitioning, the algorithm recursively sorts the two resulting subarrays: the left subarray (elements less than the pivot) and the right subarray (elements greater than the pivot).

So, in summary, the first call of the algorithm selects the first element as the pivot, performs \( n - 1 \) comparisons to partition the array, and then sorts the two resulting subarrays recursively.

Does this capture the essence of the algorithm's behavior at the first call correctly?
Teacher: Your summary is spot on! You've clearly explained the first pivot selection, the partitioning with n – 1 comparisons, and then the recursive sorting of the resulting subarrays.

Now that we have a good grasp of what happens in the first call, let’s move on to the next step: writing a recurrence for the best-case number of comparisons, T(n).

Consider the following prompting question:
How can we write T(n) in terms of T for the left and right subarrays, plus the n – 1 comparisons made during the partitioning step? Try to formulate the recurrence based on the idea of “balanced” splits (the best-case scenario).

Take a moment to derive this recurrence relation and share your thought process.
Student: Student: Thank you for the guidance! To write the recurrence relation for the best-case number of comparisons \( T(n) \), I will consider how the partitioning step and the recursive calls work together.

1. **Partitioning Step**: As we established, the first element is chosen as the pivot, and \( n - 1 \) comparisons are made to partition the array.

2. **Balanced Splits**: In the best-case scenario, we want to split the array into two subarrays that are as equal as possible. If we have \( n \) elements, ideally, we would want to split them into two subarrays of size approximately \( \frac{n}{2} \) each.

3. **Formulating the Recurrence**: Therefore, after the partitioning step, we would have:
   - One subarray of size \( \frac{n}{2} \)
   - Another subarray of size \( \frac{n}{2} \) (or close to it, depending on whether \( n \) is even or odd)

This leads us to write the recurrence relation as:
\[
T(n) = T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + (n - 1)
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
T(n) = 2T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + (n - 1)
\]

Does this formulation of the recurrence relation accurately reflect the best-case scenario for the Quicksort algorithm?
Teacher: Great work! Your recurrence

  T(n) = 2T(n/2) + (n – 1)

captures the idea of making n – 1 comparisons at the current call and then recursing on two subarrays of roughly n/2 each in the best-case scenario.

Now that we have the recurrence, let’s move on to the next step. Can you now try to solve or simplify this recurrence asymptotically (or find a closed-form expression) to express T(n) as a function of n? Please explain your reasoning and show me your next step.
Student: Sure! To solve the recurrence relation 

\[
T(n) = 2T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + (n - 1),
\]

we can use the **Master Theorem** or apply the **recursion tree method**. I'll use the recursion tree method here to visualize how the comparisons accumulate.

1. **Tree Structure**: 
   - At the top level (level 0), we have \( T(n) \), which incurs \( n - 1 \) comparisons.
   - At the next level (level 1), we have two calls to \( T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) \), each of which incurs \( \frac{n}{2} - 1 \) comparisons. Thus, the total comparisons at this level are:
     \[
     2 \left(\frac{n}{2} - 1\right) = n - 2.
     \]
   - At level 2, we have four calls to \( T\left(\frac{n}{4}\right) \), each incurring \( \frac{n}{4} - 1 \) comparisons. The total comparisons at this level are:
     \[
     4 \left(\frac{n}{4} - 1\right) = n - 4.
     \]

2. **General Pattern**:
   - Continuing this pattern, at level \( k \), we will have \( 2^k \) calls to \( T\left(\frac{n}{2^k}\right) \), and each call incurs \( \frac{n}{2^k} - 1 \) comparisons. The total comparisons at this level will be:
     \[
     2^k \left(\frac{n}{2^k} - 1\right) = n - 2^k.
     \]

3. **Height of the Tree**:
   - The recursion continues until the size of the array is reduced to 1, which occurs when \( \frac{n}{2^k} = 1 \). Solving for \( k \), we find \( k = \log_2(n) \).

4. **Total Comparisons**:
   - Now, we can sum the comparisons across all levels of the tree:
     - Level 0: \( n - 1 \)
     - Level 1: \( n - 2 \)
     - Level 2: \( n - 4 \)
     - ...
     - Level \( \log_2(n) - 1 \): \( n - 2^{\log_2(n)} = n - n = 0 \)

   The total number of comparisons is:
   \[
   \sum_{k=0}^{\log_2(n)-1} (n - 2^k).
   \]

   This can be simplified:
   \[
   = \sum_{k=0}^{\log_2(n)-1} n - \sum_{k=0}^{\log_2(n)-1} 2^k
   = n \log_2(n) - (2^{\log_2(n)} - 1) = n \log_2(n) - (n - 1).
   \]

   Thus, the total comparisons simplify to:
   \[
   T(n) = n \log_2(n) - n + 1.
   \]

5. **Final Result**:
   - As \( n \) grows large, the dominant term is \( n \log_2(n) \), so we can express the best-case number of comparisons as:
   \[
   T(n) = O(n \log n).
   \]

Therefore, the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree, which corresponds to the best-case scenario for the Quicksort algorithm, is \( O(n \log n) \). 

Does this explanation and derivation make sense?
Teacher: Great job working through the recurrence with the recursion tree method! Let’s review your work before moving on.

You started from the recurrence

  T(n) = 2T(n/2) + (n – 1)

for the best-case scenario (balanced splits) and then expanded it level by level. At level k you noted that there are 2ᵏ calls, each doing (n/2ᵏ – 1) comparisons, so the total comparisons there are n – 2ᵏ. Summing from k = 0 up to log₂(n) – 1 gave you

  T(n) = Σ[k=0 to log₂(n)–1] (n – 2ᵏ)
      = n·log₂(n) – (n – 1)
      = n·log₂(n) – n + 1.

Before we continue, I’d like you to reflect on the following:

1. Check your handling of the last level of the recursion: Since T(1) is the base case (and we assume it takes 0 comparisons), does your summation correctly capture the behavior when the recursive calls hit arrays of size 1?

2. Explain in your own words why the final sum leads to the dominant term being n log₂(n) and what happens to the “– n + 1” term asymptotically. 

Please share your thoughts on these points as the next step.
Student: Thank you for the feedback! Let’s reflect on the points you mentioned.

1. **Handling of the Last Level of Recursion**: 
   At the last level of recursion, when we reach arrays of size 1, the base case \( T(1) \) should indeed take 0 comparisons. Therefore, when we sum the comparisons across all levels, we need to ensure that the contributions from levels where the subarrays are of size 1 are accurately reflected. In the last level, where \( k = \log_2(n) \), we have \( 2^{\log_2(n)} = n \) calls to \( T(1) \), which does not contribute any comparisons. 

   Thus, when we sum from level 0 to level \( \log_2(n) - 1 \), the last term (the one corresponding to \( T(1) \)) does not add any comparisons, confirming that our summation correctly captures the behavior of the algorithm. 

2. **Dominant Term and Asymptotic Behavior**:
   The final expression we derived was:
   \[
   T(n) = n \log_2(n) - n + 1.
   \]
   In this expression, as \( n \) grows large, the term \( n \log_2(n) \) grows faster than both \( -n \) and \( +1 \). 

   When we analyze the asymptotic behavior, we focus on the dominant term, which is \( n \log_2(n) \). The other terms, \( -n \) and \( +1 \), become negligible in comparison to \( n \log_2(n) \) as \( n \) increases. Therefore, we can conclude that:
   \[
   T(n) = O(n \log n).
   \]

In summary, I believe I have accurately captured the correct handling of the last level of recursion and the reasoning behind the dominance of the \( n \log_2(n) \) term in the asymptotic analysis. Thank you for guiding me through this process! Would you like to proceed to the next part of the question?
Teacher: Great work reflecting on those points! Your explanation on handling the base case and asymptotic behavior is clear and correct. Now that we've confirmed our recurrence and its solution, let's move to the final part.

Step 3: Using our recurrence and the analysis, please compile your final answer. In your own words, state what the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree (i.e. the best-case number of comparisons) is, expressed as a function of n. 

Remember: Write down your final answer along with a brief explanation, but do not include the full derivation since we've already covered that step by step. What is your final answer?
Student: Certainly! 

The smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree for the Quicksort algorithm (when the first element is always chosen as the pivot) corresponds to the best-case number of comparisons made during the sorting process. 

After analyzing the recurrence relation and applying the recursion tree method, we derived that the total number of comparisons in the best-case scenario is:

\[
T(n) = n \log_2(n) - n + 1.
\]

As \( n \) becomes large, the dominant term in this expression is \( n \log_2(n) \). Therefore, we can express the best-case number of comparisons asymptotically as:

\[
T(n) = O(n \log n).
\]

In summary, the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree for the Quicksort algorithm, in the best-case scenario, is \( O(n \log n) \). 

Thank you for your guidance throughout this process!
Teacher: Great work throughout this process! To summarize briefly:

• We began by understanding that Quicksort with the first-element pivot always makes n–1 comparisons during the partition, plus the work of recursively sorting two subarrays.  
• We set up the recurrence T(n) = 2T(n/2) + (n–1) for the balanced (best-case) split.  
• Using the recursion tree method, we found that the total number of comparisons sums to T(n) = n log₂(n) – n + 1, which is dominated by the n log₂(n) term asymptotically.

Thus, the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree (i.e. the best-case number of comparisons) as a function of n is T(n) = n log₂(n) – n + 1, which is O(n log n).

n log₂(n) – n + 1$
