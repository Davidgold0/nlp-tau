Question: **In this question, we will discuss the Quicksort algorithm. Throughout the question, we assume the input is an array of length \( n \), and we are interested only in arrays where all elements are distinct. As is known, each sorting algorithm has an associated binary tree that represents the comparisons the algorithm performs for all possible inputs.**

We are interested in the Quicksort algorithm where the pivot element is always chosen to be the first element of the segment of the array the algorithm is working on (rather than being chosen randomly), and we will focus on the comparison tree corresponding to this algorithm.

**(A) What is the smallest depth of a leaf in this comparison tree as a function of \( n \)?**
Teacher: Let's begin by understanding what we’re being asked. We have the Quicksort algorithm where the first element is always chosen as the pivot. For any input permutation (with distinct elements), the algorithm makes a series of comparisons as it partitions and recursively sorts the array. In the resulting binary “comparison tree” (each leaf corresponding to one full execution on some input), different leaves have different depths—the depth being the total number of comparisons made on that input. The question asks: “What is the smallest depth of a leaf in this comparison tree as a function of n?”

To tackle this, here are some steps we might consider:

1. Analyze what happens in one call of Quicksort when using the first element as the pivot. What is the cost (i.e. number of comparisons) for that call on an array of size m?

2. Consider what input ordering would lead to the “best‐case” (i.e. least total comparisons) overall. In other words, which permutation makes each recursive call as efficient as possible?

3. Set up a recurrence relation describing the minimal total number of comparisons (i.e. the minimal depth) for an array of size n. (Remember, for an array of size 0 or 1, no comparisons are performed.)

4. Solve (or simplify) the recurrence to express the minimal depth as a function of n.

Let’s start with the first step: Think about one call of the algorithm on an array of size m. What comparisons are made when partitioning, and how does that contribute to the overall cost? Could you describe what happens during a single partition step and what the cost of that step would be?
Student: Sure! In a single call of the Quicksort algorithm using the first element as the pivot on an array of size \( m \), the following happens during the partition step:

1. The first element is chosen as the pivot.
2. We then compare the pivot with each of the other \( m-1 \) elements in the array to determine whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. This involves \( m-1 \) comparisons.
3. After this partitioning step, the array is divided into two subarrays: one containing elements less than the pivot and the other containing elements greater than the pivot.

The cost of this partition step is therefore \( m-1 \) comparisons. 

Now, this leads us to consider how this contributes to the overall cost when we recursively apply Quicksort to the resulting subarrays. Would you like me to proceed to the next step and think about the best-case input ordering for Quicksort?
Teacher: Great work describing how the partition step works and its cost! Now, let's consider the next step: determining the best-case input ordering for Quicksort. In this best-case scenario, we want to minimize the overall number of comparisons by choosing the "optimal" arrangement of elements. 

To guide your thinking, here's a question: What kind of arrangement of elements (i.e., how should they be ordered relative to the pivot) would lead to the most balanced recursive calls when using the first element as the pivot? This arrangement should ideally minimize the sizes of the subarrays that are recursively sorted. Could you share your thoughts on what that ordering might look like and why it would yield the minimal overall number of comparisons?
Student: Student: For the best-case input ordering of the Quicksort algorithm using the first element as the pivot, we want to choose an arrangement that leads to balanced partitions. 

In this case, the ideal arrangement would be to have the elements sorted in such a way that the pivot divides the array into two nearly equal halves. Since we are using the first element as the pivot, the best arrangement would be to have the smallest element at the beginning (as the pivot) and the remaining elements sorted in increasing order. 

For example, if we have an array of distinct elements \([1, 2, 3, \ldots, n]\), the first element (1) will be chosen as the pivot. During the partitioning step, it will be compared with all other elements, resulting in \(n-1\) comparisons. After this step, we will have an empty left subarray and a right subarray \([2, 3, \ldots, n]\) to sort.

This arrangement minimizes the depth of the comparison tree because it ensures that each recursive call processes a subarray that is as balanced as possible, leading to fewer total comparisons over the entire sorting process. 

Would you like me to set up a recurrence relation to describe the minimal total number of comparisons for this arrangement?
Teacher: Great effort so far! I want to point out one important detail before we move on. In your explanation, you described the “best‐case” ordering as the array being sorted in increasing order (i.e. [1, 2, 3, …, n]). However, if the array were in increasing order, the first element is the smallest—not the median—which would mean that after the partition step the left subarray would be empty and the right subarray would have n – 1 elements. This produces a very unbalanced split and, in fact, gives you the worst‐case number of comparisons rather than the best‐case.

For the best-case input ordering (i.e. one that minimizes the total comparisons along a particular run, giving the smallest leaf depth), we need the first element—the pivot—to be as “balanced” as possible. In other words, it should be the median of the array so that the two subarrays produced during the partition step are as equal in size as possible.

Let’s work on this together for the next step:

Step 2 (Revised): Describe the best-case input ordering for Quicksort when using the first element as the pivot. Specifically:
 • How should the array be arranged so that the first element is the median?
 • Once the pivot (the median) is picked, what will be the sizes of the two subarrays after the partition step?
Once you’ve thought about that, please share your reasoning and answer for this step.
Student: Student: Thank you for the clarification! To achieve the best-case input ordering for Quicksort when using the first element as the pivot, we need to arrange the elements such that the first element is the median of the array. 

To do this, we can consider the following arrangement:

1. Let's say we have an array of distinct elements \([1, 2, 3, \ldots, n]\). The median of this array will be the element at position \(\lceil n/2 \rceil\) if \(n\) is odd or the average of the two middle elements if \(n\) is even. However, since we are only dealing with distinct elements, we can simply choose the middle element for simplicity.

2. For an array of size \(n\), we can arrange it as follows:
   - If \(n\) is odd, we can have the median as the first element, for example, \([n//2 + 1, 1, 2, \ldots, n//2, n//2 + 2, \ldots, n]\).
   - If \(n\) is even, we can also choose the median (the two middle elements) as the first element, but for simplicity, we can still consider it as the lower middle element.

Once the first element (the median) is chosen as the pivot, the partitioning step will yield two subarrays:

- The left subarray will contain all elements less than the pivot.
- The right subarray will contain all elements greater than the pivot.

In this case, the sizes of the two subarrays will be approximately equal, leading to:
- Left subarray size: \(\lfloor n/2 \rfloor\)
- Right subarray size: \(\lceil n/2 \rceil - 1\) (since one element is the pivot)

This balanced partitioning minimizes the depth of the comparison tree because it ensures that each recursive call handles a smaller problem that is roughly half the size of the original array. 

Would you like me to set up the recurrence relation for the minimal total number of comparisons based on this best-case scenario?
Teacher: Great progress so far! You've explained the ideal arrangement for the best-case scenario where the first element—the pivot—is the median. Now let's move on to the next step together.

Step 3: Set up the recurrence relation that describes the minimal total number of comparisons (i.e. the minimal depth) for an array of size n in this best-case scenario.

Remember:
• At each call on an array of size m, the partitioning step makes m – 1 comparisons.
• After partitioning, if the pivot is the median, the left subarray will have about ⌊m/2⌋ elements and the right subarray will have about ⌈m/2⌉ – 1 elements.

Could you now write down the recurrence relation for the minimal depth (let’s call it D(n)) in terms of n? Please show your reasoning for how you incorporate the partition cost and the recursive calls on the two subarrays.
Student: Sure! Let's set up the recurrence relation for the minimal total number of comparisons \( D(n) \) based on the best-case scenario we've discussed.

1. **Partitioning Cost**: In each call of Quicksort on an array of size \( n \), the partitioning step requires \( n - 1 \) comparisons. This is because we compare the pivot (the first element) with the remaining \( n - 1 \) elements.

2. **Subarray Sizes**: After selecting the median as the pivot, we split the array into two subarrays:
   - The left subarray has approximately \( \lfloor n/2 \rfloor \) elements.
   - The right subarray has approximately \( \lceil n/2 \rceil - 1 \) elements.

3. **Recurrence Relation**: Given the partitioning cost and the sizes of the resulting subarrays, we can express the recurrence relation as:
   \[
   D(n) = (n - 1) + D\left(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor\right) + D\left(\left\lceil \frac{n}{2} \right\rceil - 1\right)
   \]

However, since the sizes of the two subarrays are roughly equal in the best-case scenario, we can simplify our recurrence relation to:
   \[
   D(n) = (n - 1) + 2D\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)
   \]

This captures the total comparisons made during the partitioning and the recursive calls on the two subarrays.

Would you like me to proceed to solve this recurrence relation to express the minimal depth as a function of \( n \)?
Teacher: You've done a good job setting up the recurrence relation. I want to pause here and refine our recurrence a bit to make sure we’ve treated the rounding issues correctly.

Recall that given an array of size n:
 • The partition step always incurs n – 1 comparisons.
 • In the best-case scenario, when the pivot is exactly the median, the remainder of the array divides as evenly as possible.

Your answer was:
  D(n) = (n – 1) + D(⌊n/2⌋) + D(⌈n/2⌉ – 1)

That expression takes into account the rounding when n is not even, which is great. Notice that for an even number n, it might break down to something like:
  For n = 2k, the recurrence is:
   D(2k) = (2k – 1) + D(k) + D(k – 1)
And for an odd number n, say n = 2k + 1:
  D(2k + 1) = (2k) + D(k) + D(k)
       = 2k + 2D(k)

Before moving on to solving, can you check the recurrence you wrote and explain how it differs for even and odd n? Please share your reasoning and if necessary adjust your recurrence.
Student: Thank you for your guidance! Let's clarify and refine the recurrence relation based on whether \( n \) is even or odd.

1. **For Even \( n \)**: If \( n = 2k \), the partitioning step incurs \( n - 1 = 2k - 1 \) comparisons. After partitioning, the pivot (the median) divides the array into two equal halves:
   - Left subarray: \( k \) elements
   - Right subarray: \( k - 1 \) elements (since one element is the pivot)

   Thus, the recurrence for even \( n \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   D(2k) = (2k - 1) + D(k) + D(k - 1)
   \]

2. **For Odd \( n \)**: If \( n = 2k + 1 \), the partitioning step incurs \( n - 1 = 2k \) comparisons. The pivot again divides the array into:
   - Left subarray: \( k \) elements
   - Right subarray: \( k \) elements (since the median is the middle element)

   Therefore, the recurrence for odd \( n \) can be simplified to:
   \[
   D(2k + 1) = 2k + 2D(k)
   \]

Now, combining these two cases, we have:
- For even \( n \): 
  \[
  D(n) = (n - 1) + D\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + D\left(\frac{n}{2} - 1\right)
  \]
- For odd \( n \):
  \[
  D(n) = (n - 1) + 2D\left(\frac{n - 1}{2}\right)
  \]

This distinction captures the structure of the comparison tree for both even and odd lengths of the array. 

Would you like me to proceed with solving this recurrence relation to express \( D(n) \) as a function of \( n \)?
Teacher: Great job distinguishing the cases for even and odd n! Your refined recurrence relations are:

 • For even n = 2k:  
  D(2k) = (2k – 1) + D(k) + D(k – 1)

 • For odd n = 2k + 1:  
  D(2k + 1) = 2k + 2D(k)

This correctly accounts for the partitioning step and the sizes of the two resulting subarrays.

Now, let’s move to the next step:

Step 4: Based on these recurrences, try to solve (or at least simplify) the recurrence to understand how D(n) behaves as a function of n. In other words, can you derive an asymptotic expression or closed-form (if possible) for D(n)? Often, a recurrence of this type leads to a solution that is on the order of n log n.

Please attempt to solve or simplify the recurrence. What reasoning or approach would you use, and what form do you believe D(n) takes as a function of n? (Hint: You might consider drawing a recursion tree or applying the Master Theorem or recursion tree analysis.) 

Please share your thoughts on this next step.
Student: To solve the recurrence relations we established for \( D(n) \), we can analyze them to derive an asymptotic expression for the minimal depth of the comparison tree. 

### Step 4: Simplifying the Recurrences

We have two cases to consider:

1. **For even \( n = 2k \)**:
   \[
   D(2k) = (2k - 1) + D(k) + D(k - 1)
   \]

2. **For odd \( n = 2k + 1 \)**:
   \[
   D(2k + 1) = 2k + 2D(k)
   \]

### Analysis

#### Even Case:
For \( D(2k) \):
- The term \( (2k - 1) \) contributes a linear term.
- The terms \( D(k) \) and \( D(k - 1) \) will contribute logarithmically as we continue to break down the problem.

#### Odd Case:
For \( D(2k + 1) \):
- The term \( 2k \) also contributes a linear term.
- The term \( 2D(k) \) suggests that we are still breaking down the problem size by half, which is characteristic of logarithmic behavior.

### Recursion Tree Analysis

If we visualize the recursion tree:
- Each level of the tree represents a partitioning step that incurs \( n - 1 \) comparisons, where \( n \) is the size of the array at that level.
- The depth of the tree will be logarithmic in relation to the size of the array since we are halving the size with each recursive call.

### Total Comparisons

The total number of comparisons across all levels of the tree can be approximated as follows:
- At the top level, we have \( n - 1 \) comparisons.
- At the next level, we have approximately \( \frac{n}{2} - 1 \) for each of the two subarrays, leading to \( n - 2 \).
- This pattern continues, leading to a series that resembles \( n - 1 + n - 2 + n - 4 + \ldots \).

If we sum these comparisons, we notice that:
\[
D(n) \approx n + \frac{n}{2} + \frac{n}{4} + \ldots
\]
This series converges to \( 2n \) (a geometric series).

### Conclusion

Combining the linear contributions and the logarithmic depth of the recursion, we find that:
\[
D(n) = O(n \log n)
\]

Thus, the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree for the Quicksort algorithm, when using the first element as the pivot and assuming the best-case input ordering, behaves asymptotically as:
\[
D(n) = \Theta(n \log n)
\]

This reflects the efficiency of the Quicksort algorithm in the best-case scenario. Would you like to discuss any further details or clarify any specific points?
Teacher: Great work on analyzing the recurrence and the recursion tree! You’ve explained the linear cost per level and how the balanced split over roughly log n levels leads to an overall cost of order n log n. Before we wrap up, let’s review your reasoning briefly:

• You set up the correct recurrences for even and odd n.
• You pointed out that, in the best-case scenario, the depth of the recursion (or the number of levels of recursive calls) is logarithmic in n.
• The total cost then comes from summing up linear costs over these log n levels, which gives D(n) = Θ(n log n).

Now, based on this reasoning, what is your final answer for the smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree as a function of n? Please provide your final answer.
Student: The smallest depth of a leaf in the comparison tree for the Quicksort algorithm, when using the first element as the pivot and assuming the best-case input ordering (where the pivot is the median), is:

\[
D(n) = \Theta(n \log n)
\]

This reflects the total number of comparisons made during the sorting process in the best-case scenario, where the array is partitioned into balanced subarrays at each step.
Teacher: Your final answer is: Θ(n log n)$
