Question: We insert a set of elements \( X_1 \) of size \( n_1 \) into a hashing table of size \( m \) using the chaining method with the hashing function \( h \). All the linked lists formed in this table had a length of at most \( k_1 \). We then insert a second set of elements \( X_2 \) of size \( n_2 \) into another hashing table of size \( m \), also using the chaining method with the same hashing function \( h \). The linked lists formed in this table had a length of at most \( k_2 \). Finally, we insert all the elements of \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \), in some order, into a third hashing table of size \( m \), again using the chaining method and the same hashing function \( h \). Provide a non-asymptotic bound, as tight as possible, on the number of keys that will be examined during a search operation (whether successful or unsuccessful) in the third hashing table.
Teacher: Let's begin by breaking down the problem into manageable steps. Here’s one way to approach it:

Step 1: Analyze what the properties of the hash tables for X₁ and X₂ tell us. In the first hash table (inserting X₁), we know that no chain is longer than k₁. In the second (inserting X₂), no chain is longer than k₂. Given that the same hash function h is used in both cases, what can you say about the maximum number of keys from X₁ and X₂ that could land in the same slot when they are combined into the third table?

Please explain your reasoning and state what you believe the maximum number of keys per slot will be when both sets are hashed together.
Student: To analyze the properties of the hash tables for \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \), we need to consider how the chaining method works and the implications of the maximum lengths of the chains.

1. **Understanding the chaining method**: In a hash table using chaining, each slot in the table can hold a linked list of keys that hash to the same index. The maximum length of these linked lists indicates how many keys can potentially collide in a single slot.

2. **Analyzing \( X_1 \)**: When we insert the set \( X_1 \) of size \( n_1 \) into the first hash table, we know that the maximum length of any chain (linked list) is \( k_1 \). This means that for any slot in the hash table, at most \( k_1 \) keys from \( X_1 \) can hash to the same index.

3. **Analyzing \( X_2 \)**: Similarly, when we insert the set \( X_2 \) of size \( n_2 \) into the second hash table, the maximum length of any chain is \( k_2 \). Therefore, for any slot, at most \( k_2 \) keys from \( X_2 \) can hash to the same index.

4. **Combining \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \)**: When we combine both sets \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) into a third hash table, we need to consider the worst-case scenario for any single slot. Since the same hash function \( h \) is used, the keys from both sets could collide in the same slots.

5. **Maximum number of keys per slot**: In the worst case, when inserting both sets into the third table, it’s possible that all keys from \( X_1 \) that hash to a particular slot could be the maximum \( k_1 \), and all keys from \( X_2 \) that hash to that same slot could be the maximum \( k_2 \). Therefore, the maximum number of keys that could be examined in a single slot when both sets are hashed together would be:

\[
k_1 + k_2
\]

This represents the scenario where the keys from both sets collide at the same index in the hash table.

So, to summarize, the maximum number of keys per slot in the third hashing table, when both sets \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) are combined, is \( k_1 + k_2 \). 

Would you like to proceed to the next step, or do you have any questions about this reasoning?
Teacher: Great job on analyzing the properties of the individual hash tables! You correctly explained that in the worst case the keys from X₁ and X₂ that land in the same slot can number at most k₁ and k₂, respectively—so in any given slot there could be as many as k₁ + k₂ keys.

Now, let’s move on to the next step:

Step 2: Consider what happens during a search operation in the third hash table (which contains all keys from X₁ and X₂). Think about both a successful search (where the target key is in the slot’s list) and an unsuccessful search. Can you explain what exactly must be examined in the chain for a search operation and then derive the corresponding non-asymptotic bound on the number of keys examined?

Please only give your reasoning for this next step, and let me know what you come up with.
Student: To analyze what happens during a search operation in the third hash table, we need to consider both successful and unsuccessful searches and how they relate to the chains formed in the table.

1. **Successful Search**: In a successful search, when we look for a key that is present in the hash table, we first compute the hash of the target key using the same hashing function \( h \). This directs us to a specific slot in the table. In that slot, we will need to traverse the linked list (chain) to find the target key. 

   Given our earlier analysis, the maximum length of the chain in any slot is \( k_1 + k_2 \). Therefore, in the worst-case scenario, we may need to examine all \( k_1 + k_2 \) keys in that chain before finding the desired key. Thus, for a successful search, the number of keys examined is at most:

   \[
   k_1 + k_2
   \]

2. **Unsuccessful Search**: In an unsuccessful search, we again compute the hash of the target key, which leads us to a specific slot. Since the target key is not in the table, we will traverse the entire linked list in that slot to confirm its absence. 

   Similar to the successful search, in the worst case, we may need to examine all \( k_1 + k_2 \) keys in the chain before concluding that the key is not present. Therefore, for an unsuccessful search, the number of keys examined is also at most:

   \[
   k_1 + k_2
   \]

3. **Conclusion**: In both cases, whether the search is successful or unsuccessful, the maximum number of keys that will be examined during a search operation in the third hash table is bounded by \( k_1 + k_2 \).

So, to summarize, the non-asymptotic bound on the number of keys that will be examined during a search operation (either successful or unsuccessful) in the third hashing table is:

\[
k_1 + k_2
\]

Would you like to move on to the next part of the question or discuss this further?
Teacher: Great work! You've explained how during both a successful and unsuccessful search in the third hash table, the operation will examine at most the entire chain in a slot, and based on the individual maximum chain lengths from X₁ and X₂, this gives a worst-case bound of k₁ + k₂.

Before we wrap up, please summarize your reasoning and state your final non-asymptotic bound (in words or an expression) on the number of keys examined during a search operation in the third hash table. Take your time to provide your summary and answer for this final step.
Student: To summarize my reasoning:

1. **Chaining Method**: In a hash table using chaining, each slot can contain a linked list of keys that hash to the same index.

2. **Maximum Chain Lengths**: For the first hash table containing the set \( X_1 \), the maximum length of any chain is \( k_1 \). For the second hash table containing \( X_2 \), the maximum length is \( k_2 \). 

3. **Combining Sets**: When combining both sets into a third hash table, the maximum number of keys that can collide in the same slot is \( k_1 + k_2 \) since both sets use the same hashing function.

4. **Search Operations**: 
   - In a **successful search**, we may need to examine all keys in the chain (up to \( k_1 + k_2 \)) to find the target key.
   - In an **unsuccessful search**, we also examine all keys in the chain (up to \( k_1 + k_2 \)) to confirm that the key is not present.

5. **Final Non-Asymptotic Bound**: Therefore, the non-asymptotic bound on the number of keys that will be examined during a search operation (whether successful or unsuccessful) in the third hash table is:

\[
k_1 + k_2
\]

In words, this means that during any search operation in the third hash table, at most \( k_1 + k_2 \) keys will be examined. 

Thank you for guiding me through this problem! Would you like to discuss anything else or move on to another topic?
Teacher: Excellent work! Your summary is clear and your reasoning sound. You correctly noted that:

1. In a hash table using chaining, each slot can have a linked list of keys.
2. The first table, built from X₁, guarantees that no chain exceeds k₁, and the second table from X₂ guarantees no chain exceeds k₂.
3. When combining the two sets into a third table, any given slot can have keys from X₁ (at most k₁) plus keys from X₂ (at most k₂), yielding a maximum chain length of k₁ + k₂.
4. Thus, during any search (successful or unsuccessful), we might have to examine at most k₁ + k₂ keys.

Your final non-asymptotic bound on the number of keys examined during a search in the third table is:

k₁ + k₂$
