Question: We insert a set of elements \( X_1 \) of size \( n_1 \) into a hashing table of size \( m \) using the chaining method with the hashing function \( h \). All the linked lists formed in this table had a length of at most \( k_1 \). We then insert a second set of elements \( X_2 \) of size \( n_2 \) into another hashing table of size \( m \), also using the chaining method with the same hashing function \( h \). The linked lists formed in this table had a length of at most \( k_2 \). Finally, we insert all the elements of \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \), in some order, into a third hashing table of size \( m \), again using the chaining method and the same hashing function \( h \). Provide a non-asymptotic bound, as tight as possible, on the number of keys that will be examined during a search operation (whether successful or unsuccessful) in the third hashing table.
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem. We have three experiments:

1. In the first experiment, we insert set X₁ (of size n₁) into a hash table of size m. The longest chain (i.e. linked list) in this table is at most k₁.
2. In the second experiment, set X₂ (of size n₂) is inserted into another hash table of size m, and there the longest chain is at most k₂.
3. In the third experiment, both sets X₁ and X₂ are inserted (in some order) into a third table, again with m buckets and using the same hash function h, by chaining.

The question asks: What is a non-asymptotic bound, as tight as possible, on the number of keys that will be examined during a search (successful or unsuccessful) in the third table?

To tackle this problem we can outline the following steps:

Step 1. Characterize the information given per table: what does a maximum chain length of k₁ (for X₁) and k₂ (for X₂) tell us about the distribution of keys into buckets?
Step 2. Use this information to reason about what happens when both sets are merged in the third table. Specifically, how can chains in the third table, in the worst case, be composed of entries from X₁ and X₂?
Step 3. Deduce a bound on the maximum number of keys that must be examined during a search in the third table.

Now, let’s begin with Step 1. Please explain what the bound on the chain lengths (k₁ and k₂, respectively) for the separate tables tells us about the distribution in each table. What can we infer for a given bucket in the first and the second hash tables? (Please answer just this step.)
Student: In Step 1, we need to analyze what the maximum chain lengths \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \) tell us about the distribution of keys in the first and second hash tables.

For the first hash table where we inserted the set \( X_1 \) of size \( n_1 \), the fact that the longest chain has length at most \( k_1 \) implies that in the worst case, there exists at least one bucket in the hash table that contains \( k_1 \) keys. This means that if we search for a key that hashes to this bucket, we may need to examine up to \( k_1 \) keys.

Similarly, for the second hash table where we inserted the set \( X_2 \) of size \( n_2 \), the longest chain having a length of at most \( k_2 \) means that there is also a bucket in this hash table where we could potentially have to examine up to \( k_2 \) keys when searching for a key that hashes to that bucket.

In summary, for any given bucket in the first hash table, the maximum number of keys that might be examined during a search operation is bounded by \( k_1 \), and for any bucket in the second hash table, it is bounded by \( k_2 \). 

This indicates that while the keys are distributed across the buckets in both tables, the longest linked lists (chains) in each table limit the maximum number of keys we might have to check in the worst case for any single search operation. 

Now, I’m ready to proceed to Step 2 when you are!
Teacher: Great work on Step 1! Now let's move on to Step 2.

In this step, we need to analyze what happens when we insert both X₁ and X₂ into a single hash table (the third table) using the same hash function h. Keeping in mind what we learned from Step 1, consider the following:

• In the first table, the worst-case chain length in any bucket is at most k₁.
• In the second table, the worst-case chain length in any bucket is at most k₂.

Now, when we insert all of the elements from X₁ and X₂ into the third table, imagine what could happen to a single bucket. How can you combine the information from the first two steps to describe the worst-case chain length (i.e., the maximum number of keys in that bucket) in the third table? 

Please answer just this step. Explain your reasoning regarding what the maximum chain length in the third table could be in terms of k₁ and k₂.
Student: In Step 2, we need to analyze how the insertion of both sets \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) into the third hash table affects the maximum chain length in any given bucket.

When we insert the elements from \( X_1 \) (of size \( n_1 \)) and \( X_2 \) (of size \( n_2 \)) into the third hash table, we are using the same hashing function \( h \). This means that the elements from both sets will be distributed across the same \( m \) buckets.

From Step 1, we know that in the first hash table, the longest chain in any bucket was at most \( k_1 \), and in the second hash table, it was at most \( k_2 \). In the worst-case scenario, when both sets are combined in the third table, a single bucket could potentially contain all the keys that hashed to it from both \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \).

Thus, if we consider a specific bucket that had at most \( k_1 \) keys from \( X_1 \) and at most \( k_2 \) keys from \( X_2 \), the worst-case chain length in that bucket after inserting both sets will be the sum of the two maximum lengths:

\[
\text{Maximum chain length in the third table} = k_1 + k_2
\]

This means that for any given bucket in the third hash table, the maximum number of keys that could be examined during a search operation (whether successful or unsuccessful) could be as high as \( k_1 + k_2 \).

Now, I'm ready to proceed to Step 3 when you are!
Teacher: Great work on Step 2! Now let’s move on to Step 3.

At this point, we’ve established that in the third hash table each bucket may contain at most the keys from X₁ (bounded by k₁) plus the keys from X₂ (bounded by k₂), which gives a worst-case chain length of k₁ + k₂.

Now, for Step 3, please state the non-asymptotic bound on the number of keys that will be examined during a search operation (whether the search is successful or not) in the third hashing table. Explain your reasoning for arriving at this bound.

Please provide your answer to just this step.
Student: In Step 3, we need to provide a non-asymptotic bound on the number of keys examined during a search operation in the third hash table.

From our previous analysis, we determined that when both sets \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) are inserted into the third hash table, the maximum chain length in any given bucket can be at most \( k_1 + k_2 \). This means that if we perform a search for a key that hashes to a particular bucket, we may have to examine up to \( k_1 + k_2 \) keys in the worst case.

Therefore, the non-asymptotic bound on the number of keys that will be examined during a search operation (whether successful or unsuccessful) in the third hashing table is:

\[
k_1 + k_2
\]

This bound reflects the worst-case scenario for any bucket in the third table, where we could potentially have to check all the keys from both sets \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) that hash to that bucket.

In summary, the maximum number of keys examined during a search operation in the third hashing table is \( k_1 + k_2 \).
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly determined that in the third hash table, the worst-case number of keys examined during a search is the sum of the worst-case chain lengths in the first two tables. To summarize:

• In the first table, each bucket has at most k₁ keys.
• In the second table, each bucket has at most k₂ keys.
• Hence, in the third table, any bucket can have at most k₁ + k₂ keys in the worst case.

So your non-asymptotic bound on the number of keys examined during a search operation in the third table is:

k₁ + k₂$

Great work!
Student: Thank you! I'm glad we were able to break down the problem step by step and arrive at the correct conclusion. To summarize:

1. **Step 1**: We determined that in the first hash table, the maximum chain length for any bucket is at most \( k_1 \), and in the second hash table, it is at most \( k_2 \).

2. **Step 2**: We analyzed how the insertion of both sets \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) into the third hash table could lead to a worst-case chain length of \( k_1 + k_2 \) in any given bucket.

3. **Step 3**: We concluded that the non-asymptotic bound on the number of keys examined during a search operation in the third hash table is \( k_1 + k_2 \).

This understanding of how chaining works in hash tables and how to combine information from multiple experiments is really helpful. Thank you for guiding me through the process!
Teacher: Great job working through the problem step by step! To summarize:

1. We noted that in the first hash table, any bucket contains up to k₁ keys, and in the second, up to k₂ keys.
2. When both sets are merged into the third hash table, in the worst case, a bucket might contain keys from both sets, leading to a maximum of k₁ + k₂ keys.
3. Thus, the non-asymptotic bound on the number of keys that must be examined during a search (successful or unsuccessful) is k₁ + k₂.

k₁ + k₂$
