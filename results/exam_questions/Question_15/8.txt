Question: We insert a set of elements \( X_1 \) of size \( n_1 \) into a hashing table of size \( m \) using the chaining method with the hashing function \( h \). All the linked lists formed in this table had a length of at most \( k_1 \). We then insert a second set of elements \( X_2 \) of size \( n_2 \) into another hashing table of size \( m \), also using the chaining method with the same hashing function \( h \). The linked lists formed in this table had a length of at most \( k_2 \). Finally, we insert all the elements of \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \), in some order, into a third hashing table of size \( m \), again using the chaining method and the same hashing function \( h \). Provide a non-asymptotic bound, as tight as possible, on the number of keys that will be examined during a search operation (whether successful or unsuccessful) in the third hashing table.
3o-mini: The key observation is that when using chaining, each bucket in the table holds the keys whose hash value maps to that bucket. In the first table, every bucket had at most k₁ keys (since X₁ was inserted with that guarantee). In the second table, every bucket had at most k₂ keys (since X₂ was inserted with that guarantee). 

Now, when we insert all the keys from X₁ and X₂ into a new table of the same size m with the same hash function h (although in some arbitrary order), the keys that will land in any bucket B are exactly the keys from X₁ that hashed to B (at most k₁ of them) plus the keys from X₂ that hashed to B (at most k₂ of them). Thus, every bucket in the third table contains at most k₁ + k₂ keys.

Since a search operation (whether successful or unsuccessful) will examine every key in the bucket corresponding to the searched-for key (until it finds the key or reaches the end of the list), the worst-case number of keys examined is bounded by the length of the longest chain, which is at most k₁ + k₂.

Therefore, the tight non-asymptotic bound on the number of keys examined during any search operation in the third hashing table is at most k₁ + k₂.
