Question: Describe a data structure that supports the following operations (where \( n \) is the number of keys currently in the data structure, and it can be assumed that all the keys are distinct):

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Insert(a)} – Adds the key \( a \) to the data structure. The operation should be performed in \( O(\log n) \) time.
    \item \texttt{Delete(a)} – Deletes the key \( a \). The operation should be performed in \( O(\log n) \) time.
    \item \texttt{Search(a)} – Returns the key \( a \) if it exists, otherwise returns null. The operation should be performed in \( O(\log n) \) time.
    \item \texttt{Sum(a)} – Returns the sum of all the keys smaller than \( a \). It can be assumed that \( a \) exists in the data structure. The operation should be performed in \( O(\log n) \) time.
\end{itemize}
3o-mini: One way to implement these operations efficiently is to use a balanced binary search tree—such as an AVL tree or a Red-Black tree—augmented with additional information at each node. In addition to storing the key, each node stores the sum of all keys in its subtree.

Here's a more detailed description:

1. Node Structure:
  Each node in the tree contains the following fields:
   • key – the value stored in the node.
   • left – pointer to the left child.
   • right – pointer to the right child.
   • sum – the sum of all keys in the subtree rooted at this node (including the node’s key).  
   • (Optionally: standard fields required for balancing, such as height in an AVL tree or color in a Red-Black tree.)

2. Invariants:
  • The tree is kept balanced so that standard operations (insert, delete, search) run in O(log n) time.
  • At each node, sum = key + (left.sum if left exists, otherwise 0) + (right.sum if right exists, otherwise 0).

3. Operations:

  • Insert(a):  
   – Perform the standard BST insertion for key a.  
   – As you go down the tree (and as you unwind the recursion or while iterating upward), update the sum at each visited node.  
   – Finally, rebalance the tree if necessary (depending on the chosen balanced BST type) while making sure to update the sum fields accordingly.  
   This operation runs in O(log n).

  • Delete(a):  
   – Locate the node with key a using standard BST search.  
   – Remove the node as usual (handle the three cases: leaf, one child, two children) and adjust the tree accordingly.  
   – As you adjust pointers and perform rotations (if any), update the sum fields of affected nodes.  
   This operation runs in O(log n).

  • Search(a):  
   – Perform a standard BST search in the balanced tree.  
   – Return the key if it is found or null otherwise.  
   This operation runs in O(log n).

  • Sum(a):  
   – The task here is to compute the sum of all keys that are strictly less than a.  
   – Since we assume key a exists in the tree, you can start at the root and proceed as follows:  
    1. Initialize an accumulator (say total) to 0.  
    2. At each node, if a is less than or equal to the node’s key, then move to the left child because all keys in the right subtree (and the node’s key) are ≥ a.  
    3. If a is greater than the node’s key, then add the node’s key plus the sum of the entire left subtree (if it exists) to total, and then move to the right child.  
    4. Continue until you reach the node with key a.  
    - Since each step in the traversal takes O(1) time and you visit at most O(log n) nodes, the operation takes O(log n).
     
   Example code logic for Sum(a) might be:
   
    function Sum(a):
     total = 0
     node = root
     while node is not null:
      if a <= node.key:
       node = node.left
      else:
       // node.key is less than a, so add left subtree sum if it exists plus node.key
       total += (node.left ? node.left.sum : 0) + node.key
       node = node.right
     return total

This augmented balanced binary search tree meets the requirement that Insert, Delete, Search, and Sum all run in O(log n) time.

4. Summary:
  By using a balanced BST (like an AVL or Red-Black tree) and augmenting each node with an extra field that maintains the sum of its subtree, you get the desired operations in logarithmic time. This is a common technique in data structure design for performing range queries quickly.

This solution efficiently supports all the required operations.
