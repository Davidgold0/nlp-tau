Question: Given a node \( v \) in a red-black tree. \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) are the lengths of the shortest path and longest path from \( v \) to a leaf, respectively. Provide a lower bound on the ratio between \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \). Justify your answer.
3o-mini: In a red–black tree, one of the key properties is that every path from a node to a leaf has at least as many black nodes as the shortest such path (which defines the black-height of that node). Furthermore, no path can have more than twice the number of nodes as the black-height because red nodes cannot appear consecutively.

Let the black-height of node v be h. Then:
• The shortest path from v to a leaf (P₁) has at least h nodes (all of which are black).
• The longest path (P₂) can alternate between red and black nodes, and hence can have at most 2h nodes.

So we have:
  P₁ ≥ h  and  P₂ ≤ 2h.

Thus, the ratio of the shortest to the longest path satisfies:
  P₁/P₂ ≥ h/(2h) = 1/2.

This means that in a red–black tree, the lower bound on the ratio P₁/P₂ is 1/2.
