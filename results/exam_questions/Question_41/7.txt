Question: The deterministic "select" algorithm, which we studied in class, works as follows:
a. The array is divided into groups of size 5
b. Sort each group
c. Choose a pivot as the median of the medians (recursively)
d. Perform "partition" with the chosen pivot
e. Recursively apply the algorithm on the relevant part.

Assume that instead of groups of size 5, we take groups of size 3. 
In this question, we will deal with the running time of the new algorithm with groups of size 3.
What is the cost of step b? 
Cost:
Explanation:
3o-mini: For each group of 3 elements, sorting takes constant time (a fixed number of comparisons and swaps). Since there are about n/3 groups, the total time for step (b) is O(n/3) = O(n).

Explanation:
• With groups of size 3, there are roughly n/3 groups.
• Sorting a fixed-size group (3 elements) has a constant cost, say c.
• Thus, the total cost for sorting all groups is (n/3) × c, which simplifies to O(n).

So, the cost of step (b) is O(n).
