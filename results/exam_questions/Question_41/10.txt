Question: The deterministic "select" algorithm, which we studied in class, works as follows:
a. The array is divided into groups of size 5
b. Sort each group
c. Choose a pivot as the median of the medians (recursively)
d. Perform "partition" with the chosen pivot
e. Recursively apply the algorithm on the relevant part.

Assume that instead of groups of size 5, we take groups of size 3. 
In this question, we will deal with the running time of the new algorithm with groups of size 3.
What is the cost of step b? 
Cost:
Explanation:
3o-mini: In step b we have to sort n/3 groups, each of size 3. Since sorting a constant-sized group (3 elements) takes constant time, the overall cost is O(n/3) which is Θ(n).

Explanation:
• The array is divided into groups of 3; thus there are roughly n/3 groups.
• Sorting each group of 3 takes constant time (independent of n, because the group size is fixed).
• Multiplying the constant work by n/3 groups gives an overall cost of Θ(n).
