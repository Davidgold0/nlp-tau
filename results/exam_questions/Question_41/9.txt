Question: The deterministic "select" algorithm, which we studied in class, works as follows:
a. The array is divided into groups of size 5
b. Sort each group
c. Choose a pivot as the median of the medians (recursively)
d. Perform "partition" with the chosen pivot
e. Recursively apply the algorithm on the relevant part.

Assume that instead of groups of size 5, we take groups of size 3. 
In this question, we will deal with the running time of the new algorithm with groups of size 3.
What is the cost of step b? 
Cost:
Explanation:
3o-mini: Step b involves sorting each group of 3. Since each group is very small (only 3 elements), we can sort any one group in constant time, that is O(1). There are roughly n/3 groups if we have n elements. Multiplying the constant cost per group by the number of groups gives:

  Total cost = (n/3) × O(1) = O(n).

Thus, the cost of step b is O(n).
