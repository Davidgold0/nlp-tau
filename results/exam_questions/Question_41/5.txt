Question: The deterministic "select" algorithm, which we studied in class, works as follows:
a. The array is divided into groups of size 5
b. Sort each group
c. Choose a pivot as the median of the medians (recursively)
d. Perform "partition" with the chosen pivot
e. Recursively apply the algorithm on the relevant part.

Assume that instead of groups of size 5, we take groups of size 3. 
In this question, we will deal with the running time of the new algorithm with groups of size 3.
What is the cost of step b? 
Cost:
Explanation:
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem. We have an array divided into groups of 3, and in step b, we are sorting each of these groups. For this step, we want to analyze the total cost of sorting all these small groups.

Here’s an outline of the steps we need to take:

1. Determine how many groups of size 3 there are in the array.
2. Figure out the cost (in terms of time) to sort one small group.
3. Multiply the number of groups by the cost per group to get the overall cost for step b.

Now, please work on the first step: Tell me how you would determine the number of groups when the array is divided into groups of 3. What expression represents the number of groups for an array of size n?
Student: To determine the number of groups when the array is divided into groups of size 3, we can use the expression:

\[
\text{Number of groups} = \left\lceil \frac{n}{3} \right\rceil
\]

where \( n \) is the size of the array. The ceiling function is used here because if \( n \) is not a multiple of 3, the last group will still count as a group even if it contains fewer than 3 elements. 

So, if we have, for example, an array of size 10, we would have:

\[
\left\lceil \frac{10}{3} \right\rceil = 4 \text{ groups}
\]

Does this make sense? Would you like me to proceed to the next step?
Teacher: Great job! You correctly determined that when dividing an array of size n into groups of 3, the number of groups is given by ⎡n/3⎤. 

Now, let’s move on to the next step: figuring out the cost of sorting one such group of 3 elements. How would you determine the cost (in terms of time complexity) to sort a single group of size 3? Please solve this next step and share your reasoning.
Student: Student: To determine the cost of sorting a single group of size 3, we can consider the sorting algorithm we might use. A common choice for small arrays is to use a comparison-based sorting algorithm like insertion sort or selection sort, which has a time complexity of \( O(k^2) \) for sorting \( k \) elements.

Since our group size is 3, the cost to sort one group of size 3 would be:

\[
O(3^2) = O(9) = O(1)
\]

This means that sorting a single group of 3 elements takes constant time, which we can denote as \( O(1) \) in terms of time complexity. 

Now, would you like me to proceed to the final step of calculating the overall cost for step b?
Teacher: Great work on determining that sorting one group of 3 takes constant time, or O(1). Now, let’s proceed to the final step: calculating the overall cost for step b. Remember, we previously found that there are approximately ⎡n/3⎤ groups, and we know that sorting each group takes O(1) time.

What expression or reasoning gives you the total cost for step b when you multiply the number of groups by the constant cost for each group? Please share your reasoning for this final step.
Student: Student: To calculate the overall cost for step b, we can use the expression we found earlier for the number of groups, which is \(\left\lceil \frac{n}{3} \right\rceil\), and multiply it by the cost to sort each group, which we determined to be \(O(1)\).

So, the total cost for sorting all the groups would be:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \left\lceil \frac{n}{3} \right\rceil \times O(1)
\]

Since multiplying by a constant does not change the order of growth, we can simplify this to:

\[
\text{Total cost} = O\left(\left\lceil \frac{n}{3} \right\rceil\right) = O(n)
\]

Thus, the overall cost for step b, when sorting the groups of size 3, is \(O(n)\).

Does this make sense? Would you like to go over anything else?
Teacher: Excellent work! Your reasoning is solid. You correctly noted that since there are ⎡n/3⎤ ≈ O(n) groups and sorting each small group takes constant time O(1), the overall time for step b is O(n). 

You've arrived at the final answer. 

O(n)$
