Question: Is it possible to implement an AVL tree with an additional operation that returns the smallest element greater than or equal to the average of the elements in \( O(1) \) time, without affecting the runtime of other operations?
3o-mini: The short answer is “no.” Here’s why:

An AVL tree can certainly be augmented to keep extra information (for example, the sum of all elements in each subtree and the total count) so that you can compute the overall average in O(1) time. However, finding the smallest element that is greater than or equal to that average is essentially a “lower_bound” query. In a binary search tree (including an AVL tree) such a lookup takes O(log n) time in the worst case.

One might wonder whether it could be “cached” or maintained as a pointer within the tree so that the query returns in O(1) time. Unfortunately, the average changes with every insertion or deletion, so the candidate node that meets the “ceiling of the average” condition would typically need to be recalculated during updates. In order to guarantee that the cached pointer is accurate, you would have to update it during tree modifications, and that extra work would “affect the runtime of other operations.”

In summary, while you can maintain the average in O(1) time by augmenting the tree with extra aggregate information, the operation of “give me the smallest element that is ≥ average” inherently requires searching (or updating a pointer in many nodes) through the tree. This search (or maintenance work) takes O(log n) time, so you cannot support this query in O(1) time without affecting the complexity of updates.

Thus, it is not possible to have an AVL tree support that extra operation in O(1) time while keeping all of the other worst‐case operations (like insertion, deletion, and search) within their usual O(log n) bounds.
