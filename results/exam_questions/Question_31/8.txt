Question: Is it possible to implement an AVL tree with an additional operation that returns the smallest element greater than or equal to the average of the elements in \( O(1) \) time, without affecting the runtime of other operations?
3o-mini: We can compute the average in O(1) time if we augment our AVL tree to store, at the root (or even at every node), the total sum and the number of nodes. That is, on each insertion or deletion we update the overall sum and count so that

  average = total sum / count

is available immediately.

However, the additional requirement is to return the smallest element that is greater than or equal to this average. In a balanced binary search tree like an AVL tree, finding the lower bound of any given key (in this instance, the numerical value of the average) normally requires a search that takes O(log n) time.

One might consider maintaining an extra pointer (or extra piece of cached data) that always points to “the smallest element greater than or equal to the current average.” Unfortunately, this pointer would have to be updated on every insertion, deletion, or rotation. Since the AVL tree rebalances in O(log n) operations per update, and even a small change in the tree or the total sum/count can change the average in a non‐local way, maintaining such a pointer in constant time per update isn’t possible without essentially “doing the work” of a lower_bound search when any update occurs.

Thus, although the average itself can be computed in O(1) time, the process of picking the smallest element that is at least that average fundamentally requires a logarithmic (in the number of nodes) search in the worst case—or extra bookkeeping that would inevitably add to the cost of the update operations. As a result, you cannot have that extra operation (returning the smallest element ≥ average) run in O(1) time without altering the usual runtime guarantees of the AVL operations.

So the final answer is: No, it is not possible to implement an AVL tree with that extra operation in O(1) time (for the queries) without affecting the runtime of other operations.
