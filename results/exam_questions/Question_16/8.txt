Question: Given a directed graph defined by a set of \( n \) nodes and \( m \) edges, where each edge is an ordered pair of nodes. The outgoing edges from each node are stored in a singly linked list.

Each node \( v \) is represented by an object that supports the following operations:
- \( \text{edges}(v) \): Returns the list of edges outgoing from node \( v \).
We assume the graph has \( n \) nodes, each identified by an integer between 1 and \( n \). The operation \( \text{id}(v) \) returns the integer identifier of node \( v \).
The entire graph is represented by an array of size \( n \), where the element \( \text{id}(v) \) points to the object representing node \( v \).

On the edge list \( L \) (outgoing from a specific node), the following operations can be performed:
- \( \text{first}(L) \): Returns the first edge in the list.
- \( \text{delete-first}(L) \): Removes the first edge from the list.
- \( \text{insert-first}(L, e) \): Inserts an edge object \( e \) at the beginning of the edge list \( L \).
- \( \text{length}(L) \): Returns the length of the list \( L \).

Each edge \( e = (v, w) \) is represented by an object that supports the following operations:
- \( \text{next}(e) \): Returns the next edge in the outgoing edge list from \( v \).
- \( \text{delete-after}(e) \): Removes the edge after \( e \) in the outgoing edge list from \( v \).
- \( \text{source}(e) \): Returns the source node \( v \) from which \( e \) originates.
- \( \text{target}(e) \): Returns the target node \( w \) to which \( e \) points.

These are the only operations that can be performed on the objects representing the graph.

For algorithm analysis, let \( d(v) \) denote the number of outgoing edges from node \( v \).

\textbf{(A)} Given two nodes \( v \) and \( w \), describe the most efficient algorithm you can to check if there is an edge from \( v \) to \( w \). What is the running time of the algorithm?
3o-mini: To check if there is an edge from node v to node w, you can use the following algorithm:

1. Obtain the list L of outgoing edges from node v by calling edges(v).
2. Set a pointer (or variable) e to the first edge in L using first(L).
3. While e is not null:
   a. Check if target(e) equals w.
   b. If yes, return True (the edge from v to w exists).
   c. Otherwise, move to the next edge in the list using next(e).
4. If you exit the loop without finding an edge to w, return False.

The running time of this algorithm is O(d(v)), where d(v) is the number of outgoing edges from node v. In the worst-case, you must examine every edge in the list.
