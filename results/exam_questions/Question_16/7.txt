Question: Given a directed graph defined by a set of \( n \) nodes and \( m \) edges, where each edge is an ordered pair of nodes. The outgoing edges from each node are stored in a singly linked list.

Each node \( v \) is represented by an object that supports the following operations:
- \( \text{edges}(v) \): Returns the list of edges outgoing from node \( v \).
We assume the graph has \( n \) nodes, each identified by an integer between 1 and \( n \). The operation \( \text{id}(v) \) returns the integer identifier of node \( v \).
The entire graph is represented by an array of size \( n \), where the element \( \text{id}(v) \) points to the object representing node \( v \).

On the edge list \( L \) (outgoing from a specific node), the following operations can be performed:
- \( \text{first}(L) \): Returns the first edge in the list.
- \( \text{delete-first}(L) \): Removes the first edge from the list.
- \( \text{insert-first}(L, e) \): Inserts an edge object \( e \) at the beginning of the edge list \( L \).
- \( \text{length}(L) \): Returns the length of the list \( L \).

Each edge \( e = (v, w) \) is represented by an object that supports the following operations:
- \( \text{next}(e) \): Returns the next edge in the outgoing edge list from \( v \).
- \( \text{delete-after}(e) \): Removes the edge after \( e \) in the outgoing edge list from \( v \).
- \( \text{source}(e) \): Returns the source node \( v \) from which \( e \) originates.
- \( \text{target}(e) \): Returns the target node \( w \) to which \( e \) points.

These are the only operations that can be performed on the objects representing the graph.

For algorithm analysis, let \( d(v) \) denote the number of outgoing edges from node \( v \).

\textbf{(A)} Given two nodes \( v \) and \( w \), describe the most efficient algorithm you can to check if there is an edge from \( v \) to \( w \). What is the running time of the algorithm?
3o-mini: To check if there is an edge from node v to node w, you can simply iterate through the outgoing edge list of node v and check each edge's target. Here's the algorithm:

1. Let L = edges(v), the list of edges outgoing from node v.
2. Set current_edge to first(L).
3. While current_edge is not null:
   a. If target(current_edge) equals w, return true.
   b. Otherwise, set current_edge to next(current_edge).
4. If the loop finishes without finding an edge to w, return false.

Since you are iterating over the list of outgoing edges from node v and comparing each edge's target to w, the running time is proportional to the number of outgoing edges from v, which is d(v). Therefore, the worst-case running time is O(d(v)).
