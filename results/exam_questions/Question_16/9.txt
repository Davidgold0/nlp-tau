Question: Given a directed graph defined by a set of \( n \) nodes and \( m \) edges, where each edge is an ordered pair of nodes. The outgoing edges from each node are stored in a singly linked list.

Each node \( v \) is represented by an object that supports the following operations:
- \( \text{edges}(v) \): Returns the list of edges outgoing from node \( v \).
We assume the graph has \( n \) nodes, each identified by an integer between 1 and \( n \). The operation \( \text{id}(v) \) returns the integer identifier of node \( v \).
The entire graph is represented by an array of size \( n \), where the element \( \text{id}(v) \) points to the object representing node \( v \).

On the edge list \( L \) (outgoing from a specific node), the following operations can be performed:
- \( \text{first}(L) \): Returns the first edge in the list.
- \( \text{delete-first}(L) \): Removes the first edge from the list.
- \( \text{insert-first}(L, e) \): Inserts an edge object \( e \) at the beginning of the edge list \( L \).
- \( \text{length}(L) \): Returns the length of the list \( L \).

Each edge \( e = (v, w) \) is represented by an object that supports the following operations:
- \( \text{next}(e) \): Returns the next edge in the outgoing edge list from \( v \).
- \( \text{delete-after}(e) \): Removes the edge after \( e \) in the outgoing edge list from \( v \).
- \( \text{source}(e) \): Returns the source node \( v \) from which \( e \) originates.
- \( \text{target}(e) \): Returns the target node \( w \) to which \( e \) points.

These are the only operations that can be performed on the objects representing the graph.

For algorithm analysis, let \( d(v) \) denote the number of outgoing edges from node \( v \).

\textbf{(A)} Given two nodes \( v \) and \( w \), describe the most efficient algorithm you can to check if there is an edge from \( v \) to \( w \). What is the running time of the algorithm?
3o-mini: To check if there is an edge from node v to node w, you can simply traverse the list of outgoing edges from v and look for an edge whose target is w. Here’s how the algorithm works:

1. Retrieve the edge list L for node v using edges(v).
2. Set a pointer e to the first edge in L using first(L).
3. While e is not null:
   a. Check if target(e) is equal to w.
   b. If yes, return "true" (the edge exists).
   c. Otherwise, move e to the next edge in the list with e = next(e).
4. If you reach the end of the list without finding w, return "false" (no such edge exists).

The pseudocode would look like this:

  L = edges(v)  
  e = first(L)  
  while (e is not null) do  
    if (target(e) == w) then return true  
    e = next(e)  
  return false  

Since you only examine each edge in the outgoing list of v at most once, the running time is proportional to the number of outgoing edges from v, which is d(v). Thus, the running time is O(d(v)).
