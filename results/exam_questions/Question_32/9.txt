Question: We construct a hashing table of size \(m\) using the chaining method. The hash function is randomly selected from a universal family of hash functions. \(n\) distinct elements have already been inserted into the table. Now, we perform a search for an element \(x\) that is already in the table. Provide the best possible bound (not asymptotic) on the expected number of elements in the list where \(x\) is located.
3o-mini: We first note that when using chaining with a universal hash function, each of the n inserted elements (other than x) has a probability at most 1/m of colliding with x (i.e. hashing to the same slot as x).

Here’s the step‐by‐step reasoning:

1. Since x is known to be in the table, it sits in one of the m slots.
2. For each of the other n − 1 elements, the chance that its hash value equals the hash value of x is at most 1/m (by the universal property).
3. The expected number of these elements that collide with x is then at most (n − 1)/m.
4. Adding x itself gives the expected number of elements in the list where x is located:
  Expected length = 1 + (n − 1)/m.

Thus, the best possible bound (not asymptotic) on the expected number of elements in the list is:

  1 + (n − 1)/m.

This tells us that on average, the list containing x has slightly more than 1 element—specifically, one plus the expected number of other elements that hash to the same slot.
