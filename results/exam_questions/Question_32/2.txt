Question: We construct a hashing table of size \(m\) using the chaining method. The hash function is randomly selected from a universal family of hash functions. \(n\) distinct elements have already been inserted into the table. Now, we perform a search for an element \(x\) that is already in the table. Provide the best possible bound (not asymptotic) on the expected number of elements in the list where \(x\) is located.
Teacher: Let's begin by understanding what the problem is asking: we have a hash table of size m, and n distinct elements (including our element x) have been inserted using chaining. We need to determine the expected number of elements in the chain (linked list) where x is located when we search for x. 

To break this down, here are the steps we might use to approach the solution:

1. Recognize that the chain where x is located always contains x itself.
2. For every other element inserted (i.e., the n − 1 elements different from x), define an indicator variable that equals 1 if that element hashes to the same slot as x and 0 otherwise.
3. Calculate the expected value for each of these indicator variables. (Remember, using the properties of the universal family of hash functions, each element’s probability of landing in any slot—specifically the slot of x—is 1/m.)
4. Sum the expected values for the n − 1 indicator variables to get the expected number of additional elements colliding with x.
5. Add 1 (for x itself) to the sum to obtain the overall expected number of elements in the chain.

Now, let’s start with step 2. Could you please express how you would define the indicator variable for one of the other elements and calculate its expected value?
Student: Sure! Let's define the indicator variable for one of the other elements, say element \(y\). 

We can define an indicator variable \(I_y\) as follows:

\[
I_y = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } y \text{ hashes to the same slot as } x \\ 
0 & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}
\]

Now, to calculate the expected value of \(I_y\), we need to consider the probability that \(y\) hashes to the same slot as \(x\). Since we are using a universal family of hash functions, the probability that any element hashes to a specific slot (including the slot where \(x\) hashes) is:

\[
P(I_y = 1) = \frac{1}{m}
\]

Thus, the expected value of \(I_y\) can be calculated as:

\[
E[I_y] = 1 \cdot P(I_y = 1) + 0 \cdot P(I_y = 0) = \frac{1}{m}
\]

This means that for each other element \(y\), the expected contribution to the chain where \(x\) is located is \(\frac{1}{m}\). 

Now, since there are \(n - 1\) other elements, we can sum the expected values for all of them. Would you like me to proceed with that step?
Teacher: Great work defining the indicator variable! Now, we need to use the linearity of expectation to sum up the contributions from the n − 1 other elements. 

To move forward, please express the sum of expected values for all these elements and then add the value for x itself to obtain the expected number of elements in the chain where x is located. What expression do you get?
Student: Student: Thank you for the guidance! Using the linearity of expectation, we can sum the expected values for all \(n - 1\) other elements. 

Since we have defined the expected value for each indicator variable \(I_y\) as \(\frac{1}{m}\), we can express the total expected number of additional elements that hash to the same slot as \(x\) as follows:

\[
E\left[\text{Total additional elements}\right] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} E[I_i] = (n - 1) \cdot \frac{1}{m}
\]

Now, including \(x\) itself, the overall expected number of elements in the chain where \(x\) is located becomes:

\[
E[\text{Total elements in the chain}] = 1 + E\left[\text{Total additional elements}\right] = 1 + (n - 1) \cdot \frac{1}{m}
\]

Simplifying this expression, we get:

\[
E[\text{Total elements in the chain}] = 1 + \frac{n - 1}{m}
\]

So, the expected number of elements in the list where \(x\) is located is:

\[
E[\text{Total elements in the chain}] = \frac{n - 1}{m} + 1
\]

Is this the correct expression?
Teacher: Excellent work! Your expression correctly accounts for the element x itself and the contributions of the other n – 1 elements. You've used the linearity of expectation properly to arrive at:

1 + (n – 1)/m

This is indeed the best possible bound on the expected number of elements in the chain where x is located.

1 + (n-1)/m$
