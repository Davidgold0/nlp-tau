Question: We construct a hashing table of size \(m\) using the chaining method. The hash function is randomly selected from a universal family of hash functions. \(n\) distinct elements have already been inserted into the table. Now, we perform a search for an element \(x\) that is already in the table. Provide the best possible bound (not asymptotic) on the expected number of elements in the list where \(x\) is located.
Teacher: Let's begin by understanding the problem in our own words:

We have a hash table of size m, and n distinct elements have been inserted using chaining. When we search for an element x that is already in the table, we want to know the expected number of elements in the chain (or list) that contains x. Since the hash function is chosen from a universal family, each of the other n – 1 elements has an equal chance of colliding with x.

To break the problem down into manageable steps, here’s one way to approach it:

1. Consider the element x that we are searching for. Notice that x is already in the table.
2. For each of the other n – 1 elements, determine the probability that a specific element is hashed to the same slot as x.
3. Sum up these probabilities over the n – 1 elements to determine the expected number of collisions (other elements in x’s chain).
4. Finally, add 1 (to account for x itself) to obtain the expected chain size.

Let's start with step 2:

Can you determine the probability that a particular element (different from x) hashes to the same slot as x, given that the hash function is chosen from a universal family and the table size is m? Please solve this step.
Student: Sure! Let's break down step 2.

We need to find the probability that a particular element (let's call it \(y\)), which is different from \(x\), hashes to the same slot as \(x\). 

Since the hash function is chosen from a universal family, the probability that any particular element hashes to a specific slot is given by:

\[
P(y \text{ hashes to the same slot as } x) = \frac{1}{m}
\]

This is because a universal hash function distributes the elements uniformly across the \(m\) slots in the hash table, meaning that each slot has an equal chance of being chosen.

Now, since we have \(n - 1\) elements (all distinct and different from \(x\)), we can apply this probability to each of those \(n - 1\) elements.

Would you like me to proceed to the next step, which involves summing these probabilities over the \(n - 1\) elements to find the expected number of elements in the chain where \(x\) is located?
Teacher: Great job on step 2! You've correctly identified that for each element y (other than x) the probability of hashing to the same slot as x is 1/m, and there are n – 1 such elements.

Now, let's move on to step 3. In this step, we need to sum up these probabilities for all n – 1 elements to determine the expected number of other elements that collide with x. What would be the sum of the probabilities for these collisions? Please solve this step and share your answer.
Student: Sure! In step 3, we want to sum the probabilities that each of the \(n - 1\) elements hashes to the same slot as \(x\).

Since we found that the probability for each individual element \(y\) (where \(y\) is different from \(x\)) to hash to the same slot as \(x\) is \(\frac{1}{m}\), we can express the expected number of collisions (other elements in \(x\)’s chain) as follows:

\[
\text{Expected number of collisions} = (n - 1) \cdot P(y \text{ hashes to the same slot as } x) = (n - 1) \cdot \frac{1}{m}
\]

This gives us:

\[
\text{Expected number of collisions} = \frac{n - 1}{m}
\]

Now, this represents the expected number of elements that collide with \(x\) in the hash table. 

Shall I proceed to step 4, where we add 1 to account for the element \(x\) itself to find the total expected size of the chain?
Teacher: Excellent work on step 3! You correctly concluded that the expected number of collisions (i.e., the other elements that hash to the same slot as x) is (n – 1)/m.

Now, let's move on to step 4. We want to find the total expected size of the chain where x is located. To achieve that, what do we need to do next? Please solve this last step by explaining how to adjust the expected number of collisions to include x itself, and then share your final expression for the expected chain length.
Student: Sure! In step 4, we need to find the total expected size of the chain where \(x\) is located by adding the expected number of collisions to the one instance of \(x\) itself.

From step 3, we found that the expected number of collisions (other elements that hash to the same slot as \(x\)) is:

\[
\text{Expected number of collisions} = \frac{n - 1}{m}
\]

Now, to find the total expected size of the chain that contains \(x\), we simply add 1 (for the element \(x\) itself) to the expected number of collisions:

\[
\text{Total expected size of the chain} = \text{Expected number of collisions} + 1 = \frac{n - 1}{m} + 1
\]

Thus, we can express this as:

\[
\text{Total expected size of the chain} = \frac{n - 1}{m} + 1 = \frac{n - 1 + m}{m}
\]

This final expression gives us the expected number of elements in the list where \(x\) is located in the hash table. 

Would you like me to summarize the entire solution, or is there anything else you would like to discuss?
Teacher: Great work on step 4! Your reasoning is spot on. You correctly added 1 for x itself to the expected number of collisions, thereby obtaining the total expected chain length as

(n – 1)/m + 1 = (n – 1 + m)/m.

This is the best possible bound on the expected number of elements in the list where x is located.

Your final answer is: (n – 1 + m)/m $
