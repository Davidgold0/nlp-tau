Question: We construct a hashing table of size \(m\) using the chaining method. The hash function is randomly selected from a universal family of hash functions. \(n\) distinct elements have already been inserted into the table. Now, we perform a search for an element \(x\) that is already in the table. Provide the best possible bound (not asymptotic) on the expected number of elements in the list where \(x\) is located.
3o-mini: We start by noting that with chaining, the expected length of the list in a hash table slot is determined by the load factor and the randomness of the hash function. Since we are using a universal class of hash functions, for any two distinct keys x and y the probability that h(x) = h(y) is at most 1/m.

Assume that n distinct elements are already inserted. Now, consider a search for an element x which is in the table. x is stored in some list (chain), and we want to bound the expected number of elements in that list (including x itself).

For every other element y (with y ≠ x), the probability that y ends up in the same chain as x is at most 1/m. Thus, the expected number of other elements in x’s chain is at most (n – 1)/m.

Including x itself, the expected total number of elements in that list is:
  1 + (n – 1)/m.

Thus, the best possible bound on the expected number of elements in the list where x is located is:

  1 + (n – 1)/m.
