Question: Given two AVL trees of size \( n \) each, is it possible to merge them in \( O(\sqrt{n}) \) time? Prove using an algorithm or a contradiction.
3o-mini: The answer depends on what “merge” means. In the special case where every key in the first AVL tree is less than every key in the second AVL tree (so that the two trees’ key ranges are disjoint), there is an AVL join (or “merge”) procedure that takes O(log n) time. (Since O(log n) ⊆ O(√n), one may say it runs in O(√n) time—but note that the actual running time is O(log n), which is asymptotically much better.) 

On the other hand, if the trees are arbitrary (that is, the keys are interleaved and not separated into “all keys in T1 are less than those in T2”), then any “merging” algorithm must essentially “look at” almost all of the nodes. For example, one standard method is to perform an inorder traversal on both trees to get two sorted arrays (each of size n) in O(n) time, merge the two sorted arrays in O(n) time, and then build a new balanced tree in O(n) time. In that case the overall time is Θ(n), which is far worse than O(√n).

Let’s explain each case in more detail.

──────────────────────────────
Case 1. Disjoint Key Ranges

Assume T1 and T2 are AVL trees with n nodes each and that every key in T1 is less than every key in T2. Then one can “join” them as follows:

1. Let h1 and h2 be the heights of T1 and T2. (Since each tree is balanced, h1 and h2 are O(log n).)
2. Without loss of generality, assume h1 ≤ h2.
3. Find a node in T2 along the leftmost (or rightmost, depending on conventions) path whose height is about h1.
4. Create a new node (or “use” the found node) such that its left subtree is T1 and its right subtree is the appropriate subtree of T2.
5. Rebalance the tree along the spine; because the imbalance is localized to a path of length O(|h1 – h2|), the rebalancing takes O(|h1 – h2|) = O(log n) time.

Thus, the joining (merging) procedure runs in O(log n) time, which is certainly O(√n) time for large n.

──────────────────────────────
Case 2. Arbitrary Key Sets

If the keys in the AVL trees are arbitrary (that is, interleaved), then “merging” the trees means producing a single AVL tree that contains exactly the 2n keys in sorted order. A common method is:

1. Perform an inorder traversal of T1 and T2 to get two sorted arrays (each in O(n) time).
2. Merge the arrays in O(n) time.
3. Build a balanced BST (for example, by a recursive “sorted array to balanced BST” algorithm) in O(n) time.

This entire process clearly takes Θ(n) time, so for arbitrary trees the merge is not possible in O(√n) time.

Conclusion

So, to answer the question:

• If the two AVL trees have disjoint key ranges (i.e. one can “join” them directly), then yes, they can be merged in O(log n) time, which is a fortiori O(√n) time.
• If the two AVL trees are arbitrary (keys interleaved), then no known algorithm can merge them in O(√n) time—the best you can do is O(n).

A “proof” by contradiction for the arbitrary case can be sketched as follows: Assume that one could merge two arbitrary AVL trees (with interleaved keys) in O(√n) time. Then, given that an inorder traversal takes O(n) time to read all the keys, the merge would somehow have to “magically” account for the order of 2n keys by performing far fewer than n steps. But since any comparison‐based decision process must examine at least a linear number of elements (it cannot “guess” the correct ordering of 2n keys without looking at essentially all of them), this assumption leads to a contradiction with the information–theoretic lower bound for merging (or sorting) numbers. Therefore, no O(√n) merge is possible in the general (arbitrary) case.

Final Answer

Yes—if the trees are “joinable” (that is, all keys in one are less than all keys in the other) then we can merge them in O(log n) time, which is O(√n) time as well. However, for arbitrary AVL trees (with interleaved key values) there is no known algorithm that merges them in O(√n) time; in that case the best known methods take Θ(n) time.

Thus, without extra assumptions on the trees’ key ranges, merging two AVL trees of size n each cannot be done in O(√n) time.
