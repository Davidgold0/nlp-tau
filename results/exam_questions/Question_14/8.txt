Question: In B-trees with a minimum degree \( d \) (where each internal node has between \( d \) and \( 2d \) children), the amount of information stored in the leaves is smaller because there is no need to store child pointers. Assume that a disk block is large enough to hold a node at its maximum size and that each node is stored in a separate disk block.

To take advantage of the free space in the disk block containing a leaf, we modify the definition of the tree and set that each leaf will contain between \( 2d-1 \) and \( 4d-1 \) elements, instead of between \( d-1 \) and \( 2d-1 \). It is given that the size of an element is equivalent to the size of a pointer, so such an enlarged leaf still fits in a block. As long as the tree has no more than \( 4d \) elements, the tree consists of a single enlarged leaf.

This is called a B-tree with enlarged leaves. Briefly describe a top-down insertion algorithm (the algorithm does not modify the tree after the element is inserted into the appropriate leaf, only during the search) for a B-tree with enlarged leaves as described above.
3o-mini: We can “fix‐up” the tree during the search so that when we finally arrive at the leaf into which we want to insert the new element, that node is not full. In other words, we perform all splitting “on the way down” so that when we get to the leaf we simply insert in sorted order without any post‐insertion fix‐up. Here’s how you can do that:

1. (Handle a full root.)  
 • If the root is “full” (that is, if it is an internal node holding 2d–1 keys or a leaf holding 4d–1 elements), then split it first. In the case of a full internal node the usual splitting procedure applies: create two nodes and move the median key up, thereby increasing the tree’s height and ensuring that the new root has room for another child pointer. (Recall that enlarged leaves hold up to 4d–1 keys whereas internal nodes have the standard maximum.)

2. (Descend top‐down.)  
 Now begin at the root and follow the search path for the new element. At each internal node:
  • Identify the child pointer that you would follow (based on the sorted order of keys).
  • Before following that pointer, check if the corresponding child is full.  
   – If the child is an internal node and already holds 2d–1 keys (i.e. 2d children), split it into two nodes (each having about d keys in the left node and d–1 keys remaining in the right node, depending on how you decide the median) and move the median key up.  
   – If the child is a leaf and already holds 4d–1 keys, split it into two leaves. (The split is done so that each of the resulting leaves satisfies the lower bound of 2d–1 elements.)  
  • After splitting, decide which of the two children now should be followed (the new element’s key will compare to the median that was pushed up).

3. (Insert the new element.)  
 When you finally arrive at a leaf that is not full, simply insert the new element into the appropriate position (keeping the keys in sorted order). Because you’ve ensured on the way down that the leaf never was full, you do not need any further modifications after the leaf insertion.

Key points of this top‐down approach:
 – You perform all “fix‐ups” (i.e. splitting a full node) before descending further.
 – By splitting full nodes on their way down, you guarantee that when you insert into a leaf no repair is necessary afterward.
 – The only modifications are done during the search, so the insertion into the leaf is a simple “insert in order” operation.

This algorithm is essentially the standard top‐down B‑tree insertion procedure but modified in two important ways:
 a. The “full” check for leaves uses the enlarged bound 4d–1 instead of 2d–1 (or d–1 for minimum leaves) so that you split a leaf when it is full under the new definition.
 b. You still only split a node before descending into it and never “bubble up” a fix‐up after doing the actual insertion.

In summary, the top‐down insertion algorithm for a B‑tree with enlarged leaves is as follows:
 1. If the root is full, split it and create a new root.
 2. Starting at the root, for each node on the search path do:
  a. Look at the child pointer you would follow.
  b. If that child is full (for an internal node, having 2d–1 keys; for a leaf, having 4d–1 keys), split it so that neither half is full.
  c. Adjust the parent’s keys accordingly and then choose the correct child.
 3. When a leaf is reached (which is guaranteed to have room), insert the new element in order.

This procedure maintains the invariants of the B‑tree (with the enlarged leaf capacity) without having to perform any modifications after inserting into the leaf.
