Question: \begin{quote}
In the following section, the initialization time and space complexity is O(1), and the space complexity at any given moment is O of the number of elements in the data structure. Describe how a vector of length m can be represented to support insertion at position i, reading from position i, and deletion at position i in O(\log m) worst-case time for each operation.

3o-mini: We can achieve the desired time and space complexities by representing the vector using a balanced binary search tree (BST) augmented with subtree size information. Such a tree is often called an order‐statistic tree because it supports efficient “select” (find the i‑th element) and “rank” (determine the position of a given element) operations.

Here’s an outline of the approach:

1. Initialization and Space Considerations:
 • Start with an empty tree. This takes O(1) time and O(1) space.
 • As you insert elements, each element is stored in a node, so the total space at any moment is O(n) (where n is the current number of vector elements).

2. Structure of Each Node:
 • Each node holds an element (the data) and pointers to its left and right children.
 • Each node also stores a size field: the total number of nodes (elements) in its subtree (including itself).
 • This auxiliary information lets you determine quickly, given a rank (position) i, which branch to follow in order to find the i‑th element.

3. Reading (Accessing the i‑th Element) in O(log m) Time:
 • Begin at the root.
 • Suppose the left child of the current node stores L elements. There are three cases:
  – If i equals L+1, then the current node is the i‑th element.
  – If i ≤ L, the target is in the left subtree.
  – If i > L+1, subtract L+1 from i, and recursively search in the right subtree.
 • Because the tree is balanced, the height is O(log m), so this “order statistic” search takes O(log m) worst-case time.

4. Insertion at Position i in O(log m) Time:
 • To insert before the i‑th element, first perform a search similar to the reading operation to locate the correct position.
 • Once the correct spot in the tree is found, insert the new node.
 • Then, update the size information in all nodes along the search path.
 • Finally, perform any tree rebalancing operations (rotations, color changes, etc., depending on the balanced BST type) to maintain the O(log m) height.
 • Each of these operations takes O(1) per node along the O(log m) height path, so the overall worst-case time is O(log m).

5. Deletion at Position i in O(log m) Time:
 • Locate the node to be deleted by performing an order-statistic search (similar to reading).
 • Remove the node using the standard deletion procedure in balanced BSTs.
 • As with insertion, update the size information while rebalancing the tree to maintain balance.
 • Again, this process takes O(log m) worst-case time.

6. Choosing a Specific Balanced Tree:
 • Any balanced BST such as a red–black tree, AVL tree, or treap (with size augmentation) would work.
 • The important part is that each tree operation (search, insert, delete) completes in O(log m) worst-case time due to the tree’s height being O(log m).

By representing the vector in this way, we support the operations (reading from position i, insertion at position i, and deletion at position i) in O(log m) worst-case time while having O(1) initialization time and O(n) space usage at any moment (n being the number of elements in the vector).

This structure is very useful in many applications where arrays (vectors) need efficient mid-sequence operations that are usually expensive in a simple array representation.
