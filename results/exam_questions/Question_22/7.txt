Question: Given an ordered set \( S \), we define the degree of an element in the set as its position in a sorted array of the elements (all elements have different values). Throughout the question, \( h \) represents the number of elements currently in the requested data structure.

\textbf{(A)} Describe a data structure that supports the following operations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Init()} – initialize the structure in \( O(1) \) time.
  \item \texttt{Insert(x)} – insert the element \( x \) into \( S \) in \( O(\log n) \) time.
  \item \texttt{Delete(x)} – delete the element \( x \) from \( S \) in \( O(\log n) \) time.
  \item \texttt{Min()} – return the element with the minimum degree (smallest value) in \( O(1) \) time.
  \item \texttt{Max()} – return the element with the maximum degree (largest value) in \( O(1) \) time.
  \item \texttt{AVG()} – return the element with the minimum degree whose value is greater than or equal to the average of the elements in the structure in \( O(1) \) time.
\end{itemize}
3o-mini: We will show that one acceptable answer is to use a balanced binary search tree (for example, a red‐black tree or AVL tree) that is augmented with a few extra global variables and pointers. (Any structure that gives you O(log h) updates and O(1) access to the minimum and maximum will do.) One “bonus” pointer is used to “cache” the answer to the AVG query. (Recall that h is the number of elements currently stored.)

Below is one way to design the data structure.

Data Structure Components

1. A balanced binary search tree (BST) ordered by element values. (All the elements are different so you have a total order.)
  • Each node stores an element.
  • Each node may also store additional information if desired (for instance, subtree size or sum) though we will not strictly need them if we have global totals.

2. Global Variables:
  • Total  – The sum of all elements in S.
  • Count  – The number of elements in S.
  • Pointer minPtr – A pointer to the node with the minimum value (this is maintained by the BST itself or by a separate record that always points to the left‐most node).
  • Pointer maxPtr – Similarly, a pointer to the node with the maximum value.
  • Pointer avgPtr – A pointer to the “AVG element” defined below.

3. The “AVG element” is defined as the element with the smallest degree (i.e. the first element in sorted order) whose value is greater than or equal to the average value of all elements. (That is, if A = Total/Count, then avgPtr should point to the node with the smallest value v such that v ≥ A.)

Operations

A. Init() – O(1)
  • Set up an empty BST.
  • Initialize Total = 0, Count = 0.
  • Set minPtr, maxPtr, and avgPtr to null.

B. Insert(x) – O(log h)
  • Insert x into the BST in O(log h) time.
  • Update Total ← Total + x and Count ← Count + 1.
  • (Optionally update minPtr and maxPtr. For example, if x is less than the current minimum then set minPtr = pointer to x, and similarly for maxPtr.)
  • Recompute the new average A = Total / Count.
  • Do a “lower_bound” search in the BST for the smallest element with value ≥ A (this is the standard BST search that uses the ordering and goes down the tree – it takes O(log h) time).
  • Set avgPtr to point to the found node.
  • (Thus, all the work in Insert is O(log h).)

C. Delete(x) – O(log h)
  • Delete x from the BST in O(log h) time.
  • Update Total ← Total – x and Count ← Count – 1.
  • Update minPtr and maxPtr appropriately. (Many BST libraries maintain these pointers automatically.)
  • If Count becomes 0 then set avgPtr to null; otherwise, recompute A = Total / Count and perform a lower_bound search in the BST for the smallest element with value ≥ A, and set avgPtr accordingly.
  • (Again, the deletion and the pointer-fix take overall O(log h) time.)

D. Min() – O(1)
  • Return the element pointed to by minPtr (or the value in the minPtr node).

E. Max() – O(1)
  • Return the element pointed to by maxPtr.

F. AVG() – O(1)
  • Return the element pointed to by avgPtr.

Discussion

Notice that the global variables (Total and Count) let us compute the arithmetic average in O(1) time. The key observation is that, although “finding” the AVG element by doing a lower_bound search in the BST normally takes O(log h) time, we don’t have to perform that search at query time if we update our pointer avgPtr during every insertion (or deletion). In other words, we “pay” the O(log h) cost during every update, so that when a client calls AVG() we have an answer already in O(1) time.

Also note that while many BST implementations (for example, those used to implement balanced trees in standard libraries) give you fast Insert and Delete, you may have to augment them (or wrap them) so that you can keep track of minPtr, maxPtr, Total, Count, and avgPtr. This design is acceptable because the extra constant amount of work per update does not change the asymptotic O(log h) bound for Insert and Delete.

Answer Summary

An acceptable answer is as follows:

• Use a balanced binary search tree to maintain the ordered set S. Let every node contain a distinct element.
• In addition, maintain global variables:
  – Total: the sum of all elements.
  – Count: the number of elements.
  – minPtr: a pointer to the minimum element (left‐most node).
  – maxPtr: a pointer to the maximum element (right‐most node).
  – avgPtr: a pointer to the smallest element with value ≥ (Total / Count).
• When an element is inserted or deleted (in O(log h) time), update Total and Count, and then recompute the average A = Total/Count and update avgPtr by performing a BST “lower_bound” to find the smallest element with value ≥ A.
• Then the operations Min(), Max(), and AVG() take O(1) time because they merely return the values pointed to by minPtr, maxPtr, and avgPtr respectively.

This meets the problem’s requirements.

Any answer that essentially uses a balanced BST (or an order statistic tree) with extra augmentation to “cache” the AVG element as described is correct.
