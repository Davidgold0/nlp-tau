Question: Describe an algorithm that solves the following problem:  
Given a set \( S \) of \( n \) numbers, the algorithm builds a data structure in \( O(n) \) worst-case time that supports only the \( \text{find} \) operation, such that:  
The worst-case time for \( \text{find} \) is \( O(n) \), but for at least \( \frac{n}{\log n} \) of the elements, the running time of \( \text{find} \) is \( O(\log n) \).  
Note that the structure is not dynamic, meaning it does not need to support insert or delete operations.
3o-mini: We will show that it is possible to “index” only a subset of S so that for at least n/log n of the elements (the indexed ones) the find procedure runs in O(log n) time, while still having an overall worst‐case find time of O(n) (for all others) and an O(n) worst‐case build time. One acceptable answer is as follows.

Let S be an unsorted set (or array) of n numbers.

───────────────────────── 
Step 1. Build the “accelerator”
───────────────────────── 
(a) Partition S arbitrarily into groups of about log n elements. (One may simply take the first log n elements as the first group, the next log n elements as the second group, etc. There will be about m = n/log n groups.)  
  Time: O(n)

(b) For each group, choose a “representative” (for example, the smallest element in the group).  
  Since there are m = n/log n groups, we obtain a set R of representatives with |R| = n/log n.  
  Time: O(n) (each group takes O(log n) to scan and there are n/log n groups).

(c) Build a balanced binary search tree (or any structure that supports O(log n) queries) T on the set R.  
  Since there are n/log n elements in R and sorting (or building a balanced tree) takes time O(|R| log |R|)=O((n/log n)·log(n/log n)) which is O(n) in the worst case, this step is also O(n).  

At the end of this build process, we have two “pieces” of information:
 • An unsorted array (or list) containing all of S.
 • A BST T over the representatives R ⊆ S.

───────────────────────── 
Step 2. The FIND Operation
───────────────────────── 
Now, suppose we wish to determine if a query number x is in S. We do the following:

1. Search for x in T.  
  • If x is one of the representatives in R, then the BST search will find it in O(log n) worst-case time.  
  • Otherwise, the search will fail in O(log n) time.

2. (Only if the search in T fails) Scan S linearly looking for x.  
  This linear search takes O(n) worst-case time.

Thus, the overall worst-case time for find(x) is O(n) (because when x is not one of the representatives, we may scan all of S). However, note that if x happens to be one of the representatives (which is the case for n/log n of the elements in S by construction) then find(x) finishes in O(log n) time.

───────────────────────── 
Analysis of the Running Times
───────────────────────── 

• Build time:  
 - Partition of S into groups → O(n)  
 - Picking a representative from each group → O(n)  
 - Building the BST on R → O(n)  
Overall build time is O(n) worst case.

• Find time:  
 - For any query, we first do a BST search in O(log n).  
 - In the worst-case we then scan S in O(n) time if x is not “indexed”.  
 Thus, worst-case find is O(n).  
 - However, for any query x that happens to be one of the representatives (and there are n/log n such values), find(x) takes only O(log n) time.

Summary
───────────────────────── 

An algorithm that works is as follows:

BUILD(S):
 • Partition S into groups of log n consecutive numbers.
 • For each group, choose a representative (say, the smallest number).
 • Let R be the set of all representatives.
 • Build a balanced BST T on R.
 • Also keep S in an unsorted array (or list) for later full scans.

FIND(x):
 • Search for x in T.
  – If found, return “x is in S” (done in O(log n)).
 • Otherwise, scan S linearly to see if x occurs.
  – This scan is worst-case O(n).

This data structure has O(n) worst-case build time, each find(x) is O(n) in the worst-case, but for at least n/log n of the keys (the representatives) the find(x) takes only O(log n) time.

Any solution that “indexes” a subset of the keys in this spirit is correct.
