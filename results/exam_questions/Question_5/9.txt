Question: Describe an algorithm that solves the following problem:  
Given a set \( S \) of \( n \) numbers, the algorithm builds a data structure in \( O(n) \) worst-case time that supports only the \( \text{find} \) operation, such that:  
The worst-case time for \( \text{find} \) is \( O(n) \), but for at least \( \frac{n}{\log n} \) of the elements, the running time of \( \text{find} \) is \( O(\log n) \).  
Note that the structure is not dynamic, meaning it does not need to support insert or delete operations.
3o-mini: We will show that one acceptable solution is to “pre‐partition” the set S into many small buckets so that for a large fraction (about n⁄log n many) of the elements one may locate the element quickly (in roughly O(log n) time), yet in the worst case a find may require looking at nearly all n elements (O(n) time).

One acceptable answer is as follows.

The Idea

Imagine that you want to “accelerate” the search for many of the elements in S. You can do this by choosing “splitters” (or “accelerators”) from S so that the whole set S is partitioned into buckets, each of size O(log n). (There will be roughly n⁄log n buckets.) Then, when you answer a query for a number x you first use a fast search among the splitters to find the bucket in which x would lie (if x is in S) and then search that small bucket in O(log n) time. (For instance, if you simply linear–scan a bucket of size O(log n) the time is O(log n).) In the worst case—if x does not belong to any bucket or if something goes wrong—you may fall back on a full scan of S, which takes O(n) time. (Thus the worst‐case running time for find is O(n).) However, for at least one element from each bucket (in fact, every member of S that is “covered by a bucket”), the find operation takes only O(log n) time.

Preprocessing (Build) in O(n) Worst‐Case Time

Because the data structure is static (we are not asked to support inserts/deletes), we are allowed a one‐time preprocessing phase.

Step 1. (Choose the splitters.)  
We want to choose roughly one splitter every log n elements, that is, we want to pick the (log n)–th smallest element, the (2 log n)–th smallest, the (3 log n)–th smallest, etc. (For simplicity assume that log n divides n; if not, one is careful with the endpoints.) Let F be the sorted array of these “splitters”; hence F will have m = n⁄log n elements. (There are known “multiple–selection” algorithms that, using the median–of–medians idea and its generalizations, can find all these order–statistics in O(n) worst–case time.)

Step 2. (Partition S into buckets.)  
Once you have the sorted splitter array F = [f1, f2, …, fm] you partition S into m + 1 buckets as follows:
 • Bucket B0 holds all elements x of S with x < f1.
 • For 1 ≤ i < m, bucket Bi holds all x with fi ≤ x < f(i+1).
 • Bucket Bm holds all x with x ≥ fm.
Notice that by the way the splitters were chosen each “middle” bucket (B1, …, B(m–1)) has at most log n elements. (One can arrange matters so that every bucket has size O(log n) by a careful choice of splitters; the precise details are not very important since any bucket of size O(log n) will take only O(log n) time to search.)  
Furthermore, you can partition S “in linear time” by doing a sequential pass: for each element, determine in which bucket it belongs. (One way to guarantee linear time overall is to “reuse” the information that the splitter values give you so that you don’t spend O(log n) time per element – alternatively one may use a recursive partitioning scheme: partition S with respect to the first splitter f1, then partition each subarray with respect to f2, etc. Since the sizes of the subarrays sum to n the total work is O(n).)

Step 3. (Do some “cleanup” if needed.)  
Inside each bucket the elements need not be sorted. In fact, for the purpose of our find operation (described next) we only need to “scan” the appropriate bucket. (If you wish you could sort each bucket in O(k log k) time – with k = O(log n) it would be only O(log n) per bucket, and O(n) total over all buckets – but it is not necessary.)

Thus, the overall preprocessing takes O(n) worst–case time.

──────────────────────────────
The Find Operation

Now suppose we want to answer a query find(x). We do the following:

1. Use binary search in F.  
Since F is a sorted array of m = n⁄log n elements, a binary search takes O(log m) = O(log (n⁄log n)) = O(log n) worst–case time.  
This binary search tells you in which “bucket interval” x should lie. (For example, if x is between f_i and f(i+1), then x—if it is in S—must lie in bucket B_i. If x < f1, then it is in bucket B0; if x ≥ f_m, then it is in bucket B_m.)

2. Search the appropriate bucket.  
Since every bucket has size O(log n), a linear scan (or binary search if the bucket is sorted) on that bucket takes O(log n) worst–case time.

3. (Fallback for “negative” queries.)  
If the element is not found in the chosen bucket, then (to be completely sure) you might choose to search the entire set S in O(n) worst–case time. This is acceptable since the worst–case running time for find is allowed to be O(n).

──────────────────────────────
Analysis

• For any query x that is in one of the buckets we built, step 1 takes O(log n) and step 2 takes O(log n) (or even less) time; hence for such x the find operation runs in O(log n) time.
• Since we designed the buckets so that every bucket (or at least nearly every bucket) contains O(log n) elements, and there are about n⁄log n buckets, at least n⁄log n of the elements of S will “live” in a bucket that can be searched quickly.
• In the worst–case (for example, when x is not in S or if unlucky choices force you to do the full scan) the time is O(n). This exactly meets the requirement that “the worst–case time for find is O(n)”.
• The overall storage is O(n), and the preprocessing (build) phase takes O(n) worst–case time.

Summary

An acceptable algorithm is therefore:

1. In O(n) worst–case time, use a multiple–selection algorithm to compute the array F of every (log n)–th order statistic of S, sorted in increasing order.
2. Partition S into buckets B0, B1, …, Bm (with m = n⁄log n) so that each bucket (except possibly B0 and Bm) has at most log n elements.
3. To answer a query find(x):
  a. Do a binary search in F (O(log n) time) to identify the correct bucket.
  b. Scan that bucket (O(log n) time) to try to locate x.
  c. (If needed, if x is not found there, then scan S completely in O(n) time.)

This data structure meets the specification: the worst–case time for find is O(n) but, for at least n⁄log n of the elements (namely, the ones stored in the buckets), the find operation runs in O(log n) time.

Note

Any answer that gives a linear‐time build algorithm and uses a “bucket–or–skip” idea (that is, fast pointers for at least n⁄log n of the keys) is acceptable. (For example, one may also “accelerate” the search for the chosen splitters and then use them to narrow down the area where x should be found.) The answer above is one acceptable solution.

This is one of several possible answers to the problem.
