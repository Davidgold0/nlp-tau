Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'r4k1r/1b1Qppbp/pp4pq/8/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2R2K1 w - - 4 18'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The move is d7b7. 

To explain briefly without giving away a full analysis: White’s queen is very aggressively posted on d7 and by capturing the black bishop on b7 white wins material while increasing the pressure against Black’s cramped position. This move not only snatches a piece but also threatens the rook on a8 and continues to interfere with Black’s coordination. 

Thus, the best move for White is d7b7.
