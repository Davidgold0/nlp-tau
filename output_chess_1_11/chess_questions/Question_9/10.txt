Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '1r2r1k1/5pp1/p6Q/2p1q3/4p3/1P4R1/P1P2PPP/4R1K1 b - - 2 30'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning move is Qxg3+, which in our notation is "e5g3". 

To explain briefly: White threatens mate with Qxg7#, and Black’s move must both defuse that threat and simultaneously create counter‐threats. The move Qxg3+ (from e5 to g3) not only checks White’s king but also removes a key attacking piece (White’s rook on g3) from the board. This counterattack forces White to respond to the check, thus blunting the mate threat and leaving Black in a winning position.

The answer is: e5g3
