Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'rn1qkbnr/1pp2ppp/3p4/p3N3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BbK2R w KQkq - 0 6'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: After careful analysis of the position, the strongest practical continuation is to complete development and safeguard the king. In the given position white is already a bit ahead in development and material and should look to preserve that edge rather than complicate things with tactical complications that might let Black generate counter‐play. The move 6. O–O (written as "e1g1") meets these criteria. It not only brings the rook into play on the open f–file (and later on the semi–open e–file) but also removes the king from the center and prepares to reinforce the center with moves like d3 (or d4) as needed.

Thus, the best move for white is:

e1g1
