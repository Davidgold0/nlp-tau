Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '1k5r/ppp2p1R/8/4q3/4P1P1/P7/1P2P3/1K1Q1B2 b - - 0 24'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: I recommend the move e5e6.

Here’s the reasoning in brief. In the position given, White’s rook on h7 is already eyeing Black’s f7‐pawn along the seventh rank. One of Black’s most urgent concerns is to keep that pawn defended. By moving the queen from e5 to e6 (that is, 24... Qe6), Black not only centralizes the queen but also adds a defender to f7 along the e6–f7 diagonal (since from e6 the queen “looks” diagonally toward f7). This prophylactic resource stops White from simply snatching the f7–pawn with Rxf7, and it keeps Black’s counterplay alive.

Thus, the best move is:

e5e6
