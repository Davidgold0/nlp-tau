Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '5rk1/6pn/Q6p/1p2R3/8/5N2/1q3PPP/6K1 b - - 0 26'. 

What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The decisive move is f8f3. 

To explain briefly without giving away all the secret tricks: Black removes a key guardian around White’s king by capturing on f3. With the knight on f3 eliminated, Black’s pieces (especially the queen in combination with the other heavy‐piece) coordinate powerfully against the exposed White king. This sacrifice turns White’s seemingly safe position into a mating net that is very hard to defend.

Thus, the best move for Black is:
f8f3
