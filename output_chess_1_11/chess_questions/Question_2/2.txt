Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'r1b2r1k/pp1p1p1p/4p2B/2p1nP2/2P1P3/1P4R1/P5PP/7K w - - 4 21'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
Teacher: Let's first make sure we understand the problem. We have the board position given by the FEN string "r1b2r1k/pp1p1p1p/4p2B/2p1nP2/2P1P3/1P4R1/P5PP/7K w - - 4 21". Our task is to find the best move for White, expressed in the format [source square][destination square] (for example, "f8f4").

To approach this problem, we can break it down into a few steps:

1. Analyze the board position:
   - Identify the placement of White’s pieces and their activity.
   - Recognize any immediate threats or tactical opportunities.
   - Evaluate potential candidate moves that improve White’s position.

2. Evaluate candidate moves:
   - Look for moves that might exploit weaknesses in Black’s position.
   - Consider piece safety and potential tactics like captures, checks, or forks.

3. Decide on the move:
   - Weigh the consequences of each candidate move.
   - Determine which move provides the best advantages in the position.

Now, let's start with step 1. Could you please analyze the position and describe which White pieces are active and what tactical ideas might be available? Focus on identifying potential threats or opportunities based on the piece placement.
Student: Sure! Let's analyze the given board position from the FEN string "r1b2r1k/pp1p1p1p/4p2B/2p1nP2/2P1P3/1P4R1/P5PP/7K w - - 4 21".

1. **Placement of White’s Pieces:**
   - White has a rook on f3, a bishop on h5, and pawns on a3, b4, c4, d5, e4, and f5. 
   - The king is on h2.
   - The bishop on h5 is well-placed to exert pressure on Black's position.

2. **Activity of White’s Pieces:**
   - The rook on f3 is somewhat active but can be improved.
   - The bishop on h5 can create threats against Black’s pawns and pieces.
   - The pawns on the c and d files are advanced and can potentially create passed pawns.

3. **Immediate Threats or Tactical Opportunities:**
   - The bishop on h5 can threaten to capture the pawn on e4 or potentially create a discovered attack if the rook moves.
   - The advanced pawns on c4 and d5 can support each other and potentially push further.
   - Black has a knight on e4 that could be a target, and the rook on f8 is currently not defending any critical squares.

Based on this analysis, I see that White has several options, but the most compelling tactical idea is to move the rook from f3 to f8. This would put the rook on a square where it can check the Black king and potentially win material. 

Shall I proceed with this candidate move, or would you like to explore other options?
Teacher: Alright, let's take a closer look at your analysis. I noticed a few discrepancies that we should address before deciding on any candidate move.

Your current analysis mentioned a rook on f3 and the bishop on h5, as well as the king on h2. However, if we carefully decode the FEN string "r1b2r1k/pp1p1p1p/4p2B/2p1nP2/2P1P3/1P4R1/P5PP/7K w - - 4 21", we need to accurately identify where White’s pieces are located.

For the next step, please reexamine the FEN string and list the exact squares where White’s pieces (king, bishop(s), rook(s), and pawn(s)) are placed. Take your time to decode each rank carefully. What are the positions of White's pieces based on the given FEN?
Student: Sure! Let me reexamine the FEN string "r1b2r1k/pp1p1p1p/4p2B/2p1nP2/2P1P3/1P4R1/P5PP/7K w - - 4 21" and accurately identify the positions of White's pieces.

1. **White's Pieces:**
   - **King (K)**: h2
   - **Bishop (B)**: h5
   - **Rook (R)**: f4
   - **Pawns (P)**:
     - a3
     - b4
     - c4
     - d5
     - e4
     - f5

Now that I have listed the positions of all of White's pieces, I can see that the rook is actually on f4, not f3 as I previously stated. 

With this corrected information, I can analyze the position again. The active pieces are the bishop on h5 and the rook on f4. 

Would you like me to proceed with analyzing potential moves given this corrected piece placement?
Teacher: Let's take a closer look at the FEN string together. Remember, the FEN notation describes the board from rank 8 down to rank 1. Could you please reexamine the FEN string "r1b2r1k/pp1p1p1p/4p2B/2p1nP2/2P1P3/1P4R1/P5PP/7K w - - 4 21" and list the exact squares where White’s pieces are located? Focus on the key pieces—the king, the bishop, and the rook—as well as all White pawns. Take your time and decode each rank carefully. What are the correct positions for each of White’s pieces?
Student: Sure! I will carefully decode the FEN string "r1b2r1k/pp1p1p1p/4p2B/2p1nP2/2P1P3/1P4R1/P5PP/7K w - - 4 21" and list the exact positions of White's pieces.

The FEN describes the chessboard from rank 8 to rank 1. Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Rank 8**: r1b2r1k
   - Black pieces: rook on a8, bishop on c8, rook on f8, king on h8

2. **Rank 7**: pp1p1p1p
   - Black pawns: a7, b7, d7, f7, h7

3. **Rank 6**: 4p2B
   - Black pawn on e6, White bishop on h6

4. **Rank 5**: 2p1nP2
   - Black pawn on c5, knight on e5, White pawn on f5

5. **Rank 4**: 2P1P3
   - White pawns on c4 and d4

6. **Rank 3**: 1P4R1
   - White pawn on b3, rook on f3

7. **Rank 2**: P5PP
   - White pawns on a2, g2, and h2

8. **Rank 1**: 7K
   - White king on h1

Now, compiling the positions for White's pieces:

- **King (K)**: h1
- **Bishop (B)**: h6
- **Rook (R)**: f3
- **Pawns (P)**:
  - a2
  - b3
  - c4
  - d4
  - f5
  - g2
  - h2

With this accurate placement of White's pieces, I can see that the rook is on f3, and the bishop is on h6. 

Would you like me to analyze potential moves based on this corrected piece placement?
Teacher: Let's work on getting the positions exactly right by carefully decoding ranks 4 and 3 together.

Remember, the FEN string is given rank by rank from 8 down to 1. We already agreed on ranks 8, 7, 6, 5, 2, and 1. Now, please focus on:

• Rank 4: "2P1P3"  
• Rank 3: "1P4R1"

For rank 4 ("2P1P3"):  
– The "2" means the first two squares (a4 and b4) are empty.  
– Then "P" means there is a White pawn on c4.  
– Next, "1" means one empty square (d4 is empty).  
– Then "P" means a White pawn on e4.  
– Finally, "3" means the last three squares (f4, g4, h4) are empty.

For rank 3 ("1P4R1"):  
– The "1" means a3 is empty.  
– Then "P" places a White pawn on b3.  
– "4" means the next four squares (c3, d3, e3, f3) are empty.  
– "R" means a White rook is on g3.  
– The final "1" tells us that h3 is empty.

Could you please restate the correct locations of all White pieces—focusing on the king, bishop, rook, and all pawns—based on this careful decoding?
Student: Sure! Let's carefully decode the FEN string "r1b2r1k/pp1p1p1p/4p2B/2p1nP2/2P1P3/1P4R1/P5PP/7K w - - 4 21" and accurately identify the positions of all White pieces.

1. **Rank 8**: r1b2r1k  
   - Black pieces: rook on a8, bishop on c8, rook on f8, king on h8

2. **Rank 7**: pp1p1p1p  
   - Black pawns: a7, b7, d7, f7, h7

3. **Rank 6**: 4p2B  
   - Black pawn on e6, White bishop on h6

4. **Rank 5**: 2p1nP2  
   - Black pawn on c5, knight on e5, White pawn on f5

5. **Rank 4**: 2P1P3  
   - White pawns: c4 (P) and e4 (P); a4, b4, and d4 are empty.

6. **Rank 3**: 1P4R1  
   - White pawn on b3 (P); a3 is empty, and the rook is on f3 (R); c3, d3, e3, and g3 are empty.

7. **Rank 2**: P5PP  
   - White pawns: a2 (P), g2 (P), and h2 (P); b2, c2, d2, e2, and f2 are empty.

8. **Rank 1**: 7K  
   - White king on h1 (K).

Now, compiling the positions for White's pieces:

- **King (K)**: h1
- **Bishop (B)**: h6
- **Rook (R)**: f3
- **Pawns (P)**:
  - a2
  - b3
  - c4
  - e4
  - f5
  - g2
  - h2

With this accurate placement of White's pieces, I can see that the rook is on f3, and the bishop is on h6. 

Would you like me to analyze potential moves based on this corrected piece placement?
Teacher: Great work decoding the FEN and listing the exact squares for all White's pieces! Now that we have:

• King on h1  
• Bishop on h6  
• Rook on f3  
• Pawns on a2, b3, c4, e4, f5, g2, h2  

let’s move on to the next step: looking for candidate moves.

Based on this position, think about these guiding questions:

1. What threats or tactics might White be planning with the bishop on h6 and the rook on f3?
2. Which Black pieces or pawns seem vulnerable or under-defended?
3. Are there any forcing moves (checks, captures, or threats) that could put Black on the defensive?

Please choose one promising candidate move for White, and explain your reasoning for why this move might be strong. What’s your candidate move and why?
Student: Based on the analysis of the board position and the placement of White's pieces, here’s what I found:

1. **Threats with the Bishop on h6**: The bishop on h6 is currently attacking the pawn on e6. If I can remove the knight on e5, the bishop would have a clear line to attack the Black pawns or pieces.

2. **Vulnerable Black Pieces**: The knight on e5 is currently a strong piece for Black, but it is also a target. If I can capture it, it would weaken Black's control over the center and make the position more favorable for White.

3. **Forcing Moves**: One strong candidate move for White is to move the rook from f3 to f5. This move not only puts pressure on the knight on e5, but also threatens to capture it in the next move. Additionally, it keeps the rook active and centralized, which is important for controlling the board.

Therefore, my candidate move is **f3f5**. This move attacks the knight on e5 and creates a strong position for White. Would you like me to proceed with this move, or do you have any suggestions or corrections?
Teacher: Let's review the candidate move you suggested—f3f5—by checking the board details. Based on our decoded position, can you verify the contents of the f5 square? Take a moment to double-check which piece, if any, occupies f5 and whether moving the rook from f3 to f5 is legal. What do you find about the f5 square, and does this affect your candidate move?
Student: Upon reviewing the board position again, I see that the f5 square is actually occupied by a White pawn. This means that moving the rook from f3 to f5 is not a legal move, as a piece cannot move to a square that is already occupied by a piece of the same color.

Given this, I need to consider another candidate move. 

One potential move could be to capture the knight on e5 with the bishop by moving from h6 to e5 (Bxe5). This would remove a strong piece from Black's position and put pressure on the Black pawns. 

So, my new candidate move is **h6e5**. This captures the knight and improves White's position. Would you like me to proceed with this move, or do you have any other suggestions?
Teacher: You're doing a great job investigating candidate moves. Let's review your latest candidate move in detail. You suggested moving the bishop from h6 to e5 (written as h6e5) to capture the knight. However, before finalizing any candidate move, it's important to check the piece's legal movement patterns.

Remember that a bishop moves only diagonally. Look carefully at the squares on the diagonal from h6. Does the square e5 lie along one of those diagonals? Take a moment to verify the diagonal path from h6 and determine whether a move to e5 would be legal. What is your conclusion?
Student: You're right! I need to carefully check the movement of the bishop. The bishop on h6 moves diagonally, and the squares it can reach are along the diagonals from its position. 

From h6, the bishop can move to the following squares: g5, f4, e3, d2, c1, and it cannot reach e5 because e5 is not on its diagonal path. Therefore, moving the bishop from h6 to e5 is not a legal move.

Given this realization, I need to find another candidate move. 

Another strong option is to move the rook from f3 to f4 (f3f4). This move keeps the rook active and applies pressure on the f5 pawn, while also preparing to support potential advances of the other pawns. 

So, my new candidate move is **f3f4**. This move maintains the pressure and keeps White's position strong. Would you like me to proceed with this move, or do you have any other suggestions?
Teacher: That's an interesting candidate move. Let's take a moment to evaluate f3f4 more deeply.

Before moving ahead, please consider a few questions:
1. What tactical or positional threats does moving the rook from f3 to f4 create? For example, does it pressure any Black pieces or key squares?
2. How does this move affect the coordination between your pieces, especially considering Black's knight on e5 and the other pieces?
3. Are there any potential drawbacks or counterattacks from Black if you place your rook on f4?

Please explain what you believe are the advantages (and possible disadvantages) of f3f4, detailing how this move influences the balance of the position. Let's discuss your analysis before moving on to the next step.
Student: Sure! Let's analyze the move f3f4 in detail:

1. **Tactical and Positional Threats**: 
   - Moving the rook from f3 to f4 does put pressure on the pawn at f5, which is a potential target for White. It also keeps the rook active along the fourth rank, allowing it to participate in future attacks or support other pieces.
   - However, it does not directly address the knight on e5, which remains a strong piece for Black. The knight can continue to exert influence in the center of the board, and the move does not immediately threaten any of Black's pieces.

2. **Coordination Between Pieces**: 
   - The rook on f4 can support the pawns on e4 and f5, potentially allowing for pawn advances. However, it does not create a direct threat to the knight on e5, which could continue to be a nuisance.
   - The bishop on h6 remains somewhat isolated, as moving the rook does not enhance its position or create additional threats against Black's pieces.

3. **Potential Drawbacks or Counterattacks**:
   - By moving the rook to f4, I might be neglecting the knight on e5. If Black chooses to move the knight, it could create threats against my pieces or even fork them.
   - Additionally, if Black has a way to counterattack while I focus on the f5 pawn, I could find myself in a precarious position.

Given these considerations, while f3f4 does maintain pressure on the f5 pawn and keeps the rook active, it may not be the most aggressive or effective move given the current threats posed by Black's knight.

Instead, I could consider moving the bishop from h6 to g5 (h6g5). This move would keep the bishop active and create a pin against the knight on e5, as the knight would be unable to move without exposing the Black king to a check from the bishop. 

So, my new candidate move is **h6g5**. This move directly addresses the knight's position while maintaining pressure on Black’s pieces. Would you like me to proceed with this move, or do you have further suggestions?
Teacher: You're doing a good job exploring different candidate moves! However, let's carefully check the move h6g5 and its tactical implications. When the bishop moves from h6 to g5, we need to verify two things:

1. Is the move legal? (That is, is g5 on a valid diagonal from h6?)  
2. What tactical threat does the bishop create from g5? For example, does it pin the Black knight on e5 to the Black king or another valuable piece?

Take a closer look at the diagonal from h6. Which squares does the bishop control after moving to g5? Now, determine if the Black knight on e5 falls on that line and is thus pinned, or if the bishop is simply repositioning without creating the desired pin. Please explain your reasoning.
Student: Let's analyze the move h6g5 carefully.

1. **Is the Move Legal?**: 
   - The bishop on h6 moves diagonally. The squares it can reach from h6 are g5, f4, e3, d2, c1, and so on. Therefore, moving to g5 is indeed a legal move.

2. **Tactical Threat from g5**: 
   - When the bishop moves to g5, it does not create a pin against the knight on e5. The knight is not pinned because it is not directly in line with the Black king on h8. The bishop on g5 can attack the knight, but it doesn't prevent the knight from moving. 

Instead, the knight can still move freely, and the pressure on the knight is not as strong as I initially thought. The knight can simply retreat or move to another square without any immediate consequence.

Given this analysis, while h6g5 is a legal move, it does not create the tactical advantage I was hoping for. 

I need to reconsider my options. One potential move is to capture the knight on e5 with the bishop by moving h6 to e5 (h6xe5). This would eliminate a strong piece for Black while also putting pressure on the Black pawns.

So, my new candidate move is **h6xe5**. This captures the knight and improves White's position significantly. Would you like me to proceed with this move, or do you have further suggestions?
Teacher: Let's take a moment to revisit your latest candidate move, h6xe5. I want you to re-check whether the bishop on h6 can legally capture a piece on e5.

Look at the movement pattern of a bishop: it moves diagonally, so the difference in files must match the difference in ranks. Consider the square h6 and the square e5. Are they on the same diagonal? Take a moment to determine this and explain your reasoning.
Student: You're right; I need to carefully analyze the legality of the move h6xe5. 

The bishop on h6 can indeed only move diagonally. To determine if it can capture a piece on e5, I need to check if e5 lies on the diagonal path from h6.

- The square h6 is on the 6th rank and the 8th file.
- The square e5 is on the 5th rank and the 5th file.

To move from h6 to e5, the bishop would need to move three squares left (from file h to file e) and one square down (from rank 6 to rank 5). However, this does not maintain the diagonal movement pattern, as the bishop can only move diagonally to squares that are equal in the difference of their ranks and files. 

Since h6 and e5 do not share the same diagonal, the move h6xe5 is not legal.

Given this, I need to find another candidate move. 

One strong option could be to move the rook from f3 to f4 (f3f4), which keeps the rook active and puts pressure on the f5 pawn while allowing for future coordination with my other pieces.

So, my new candidate move is **f3f4**. This maintains pressure on f5 and keeps my rook in a strong position. Would you like me to proceed with this move, or do you have any other suggestions?
Teacher: Great effort examining candidate moves! Let's take a moment to analyze the rook move f3f4 a bit deeper before settling on it.

Here’s a guiding question for you: Consider Black’s knight on e5. When you move your rook from f3 to f4, how does that move affect the knight’s positioning or influence? Does this rook move help restrict the knight’s options, or might Black easily reposition it? Also, think about how f3f4 interacts with your other pieces and the overall board balance. 

Please elaborate on your analysis regarding the knight on e5—specifically, how does f3f4 contribute to dealing with that knight and what tactical or positional benefits (or drawbacks) might arise from that move?
Student: Thank you for the guidance! Let's analyze the move f3f4 in relation to the knight on e5 and the overall board position.

1. **Knight on e5**: 
   - Moving the rook from f3 to f4 does not directly affect the knight on e5. The knight remains on the same square and can still move freely. After f3f4, Black has the option to move the knight to various squares, such as c4 or f3, without any hindrance from my rook.
   - Since the knight is not under threat from my rook move, Black can maintain its strong central position and potentially create counterplay.

2. **Positional Influence**:
   - The rook on f4 does exert pressure on the f5 pawn, which could be beneficial. However, it does not create any immediate tactical threats against Black’s pieces. The knight on e5 remains a significant piece for Black, and my rook move does not challenge its influence.
   - Additionally, the bishop on h6 remains somewhat passive, as the rook move does not enhance its position or create new threats.

3. **Tactical and Positional Benefits**:
   - While f3f4 keeps my rook active and supports a future pawn advance, it doesn’t address the immediate concern of the knight on e5. If Black chooses to move the knight, it could create threats against my pieces or allow for forks.
   - There’s also the possibility that this move could lead to a slower game for White, as I’m not making any aggressive moves to challenge Black’s strong pieces.

Given this analysis, I realize that while f3f4 maintains some pressure, it may not be the most effective move considering the knight on e5 remains unchallenged. 

As a new candidate move, I could consider moving the bishop from h6 to g5 (h6g5). This move would keep the bishop active and create a direct threat against the knight on e5, forcing Black to respond. 

So, my new candidate move is **h6g5**. This move keeps pressure on the knight and increases my piece activity. Would you like me to proceed with this move, or do you have further suggestions?
Teacher: You're doing well exploring candidate moves. Let's focus on your latest candidate move: h6g5.

Before we decide on h6g5, I want you to take a careful look at two key points:

1. From h6, moving to g5 is a legal diagonal move (you move one square diagonally to the left and downward). So that part is fine.
2. Now, think about the tactical impact: After playing h6g5, which squares does the bishop control? Does it create a threat against Black's knight on e5 or any other critical piece? In other words, after the bishop reaches g5, which pieces (if any) are being attacked or pinned?

Please analyze the control pattern from the bishop residing on g5. Does the bishop on g5 directly attack or pin the Black knight on e5? Explain your reasoning.
Student: Thank you for your guidance! Let's analyze the move h6g5 in detail.

1. **Legal Move**: 
   - The move from h6 to g5 is indeed legal. The bishop moves diagonally one square left and down, which is a valid movement pattern for a bishop.

2. **Tactical Impact of h6g5**: 
   - After moving to g5, the bishop does control the g5 square, but it does not create a direct threat against the knight on e5. The knight remains on e5, and the bishop on g5 does not attack it directly.
   - The knight on e5 is still free to move without any restriction, as there is no pin or direct threat to it from the bishop on g5. 

In summary, while h6g5 is a legal move, it does not effectively challenge the knight on e5 or create any immediate tactical advantage. The knight can still move freely, and I would not be putting any pressure on it.

Given this realization, I need to consider another candidate move. 

A strong option would be to move the rook from f3 to f5 (f3f5). This move would put direct pressure on the knight on e5, forcing Black to respond. It also keeps the rook active and centralized, which is crucial for future play.

So, my new candidate move is **f3f5**. This move directly threatens the knight on e5 and enhances my position. Would you like me to proceed with this move, or do you have further suggestions?
Teacher: Let's take a step back and reexamine our candidate moves. We’ve already ruled out moves like f3f5 (since the f5 square is occupied by your own pawn) and moves involving the bishop capturing on e5 (because e5 isn’t on its diagonal). 

Now, let’s consider another idea that hasn’t been examined yet: the pawn on f5 can capture diagonally on e6. That is, the move f5xe6. 

Before we decide on this move, here are some guiding questions for you to analyze:

1. First, verify that f5xe6 is legal. Which piece sits on e6, and is it a valid capture for a pawn on f5?  
2. What tactical or positional benefits might arise from playing f5xe6? For example, could capturing on e6 disrupt Black’s pawn structure or expose the Black king?  
3. Are there any potential drawbacks or immediate responses from Black that you should consider after f5xe6?

Please work through these questions and explain your reasoning regarding the move f5xe6. What do you think about its potential advantages and disadvantages?
Student: Thank you for your guidance! Let's analyze the potential move f5xe6 step by step.

1. **Legal Move**: 
   - The pawn on f5 can capture a piece on e6 if there is a valid target there. Looking at the board position, the e6 square is occupied by a Black pawn. Therefore, f5xe6 is a legal move, and it results in capturing the Black pawn on e6.

2. **Tactical and Positional Benefits**:
   - Capturing on e6 removes a pawn from Black's structure, which could weaken their pawn formation. It also opens up lines for my pieces, particularly the bishop on h6, which can now exert pressure on the f7 pawn or potentially target other squares.
   - Additionally, this move places my pawn on e6, which is an advanced pawn that could become a passed pawn if it can be supported further. 
   - Importantly, capturing on e6 does not expose my king to immediate threats, as Black's pieces are not well-positioned to counterattack right away.

3. **Potential Drawbacks or Responses from Black**:
   - After f5xe6, Black could respond by capturing the pawn on e6 with their knight on e5. This would remove my newly advanced pawn, but it would still allow me to maintain some pressure on the board.
   - Additionally, although my pawn on e6 is strong, it could also become a target if not properly supported.

Given this analysis, I believe that f5xe6 is a strong candidate move. It captures a Black pawn, disrupts Black's pawn structure, and places my pawn on a strong square. 

So, my candidate move is **f5xe6**. Would you like me to proceed with this move, or do you have further suggestions?
Teacher: Great job analyzing the move f5xe6 in detail! You've correctly verified that the pawn on f5 can legally capture on e6 (since there's a Black pawn there), and you’ve identified some key tactical advantages: the capture disrupts Black’s pawn structure, potentially opens lines for your pieces, and creates an advanced pawn. You've also considered Black’s possible responses, such as recapturing with the knight on e5.

If you're satisfied that the advantages of f5xe6 outweigh any drawbacks from Black’s reply, then you have arrived at a promising candidate move.

Please restate your final candidate move in the notation [source square][destination square] followed immediately by a $ (with nothing following the $). What is your final answer?
Student: My final candidate move is **f5xe6$**.
Teacher: Your analysis has been thoughtful, and you’ve verified that f5xe6 is legal (capturing the Black pawn on e6) and provides strong tactical and positional benefits.

To confirm:
• f5xe6 is legal because the pawn on f5 can capture diagonally and e6 is occupied by a Black pawn.
• Capturing on e6 disrupts Black’s pawn structure, opens lines for your pieces, and places an advanced pawn.
• You’ve considered that Black might recapture with the knight on e5, but overall, the move promises a favorable shift in the position.

If you’re satisfied with these points, please restate your final candidate move using the exact notation [source square][destination square] immediately followed by a $.

What is your final answer?
Student: My final candidate move is **f5xe6$**.
Teacher: Your careful analysis led you to the candidate move f5xe6; however, remember that our required move notation is simply [source square][destination square] with no capture indicators. With that in mind, please restate your final answer following that format, with the move immediately followed by a $ and nothing else.
Student: My final candidate move is **f5e6$**.
Teacher: Great work! You've carefully analyzed the position, verified the move f5xe6 as legal, discussed its tactical benefits, and adjusted the notation accordingly. 

Your final answer, written as [source square][destination square], is: f5e6$
