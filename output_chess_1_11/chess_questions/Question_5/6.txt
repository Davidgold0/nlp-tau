Question: You are a very strong chess engine.

The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'r3r1k1/pp5p/n3q3/3B1QP1/2p5/7P/PP6/2K2n2 w - - 2 35'. 

What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., "f8f4").
3o-mini: The winning move is f5f1. 

To explain briefly: The white queen on f5 is attacked by Black’s queen on e6, so White must find a move that both escapes the attack and creates extra threats. By playing Qxf1 (moving the queen from f5 to f1), White not only removes the queen from danger but also captures Black’s knight sitting on f1—a free piece with no satisfactory recapture available for Black. This tactical shot gives White a decisive material advantage.

Thus, the best move for White is: f5f1.
