"Question: Given \( n \) distinct and sorted keys, describe an efficient data structure that maintains these keys (assume the structure is already built, so the cost of building it is not important) and supports the operation \( \text{find\_delete(key)} \), which receives a key and returns false if the key is not in the structure. If the key is in the structure, the operation returns true and removes it from the structure.  "
Required cost: \( O(\log n) \) for the \( \text{find\_delete(key)} \) operation.
"3o-mini: An ideal solution is to store the keys in a balanced binary search tree. For instance, using a red-black tree (or an AVL tree) you can perform both the search and deletion in O(log n) worst‚Äêcase time."
Here's how it works:
"1. The keys are stored as nodes in the tree. Because they are inserted initially in sorted order, the tree can be built (or balanced afterwards) so that it satisfies the balanced BST properties."
"2. The operation find_delete(key) starts by performing a binary search for the key, which takes O(log n) time since the tree is balanced."
"3. If the key is found in the tree, the deletion routine is called. In a red-black tree or AVL tree, deletion is also performed in O(log n) time because any rebalancing is limited to a constant number of rotations or adjustments along the search path."
"4. If the key is not present in the tree, the search will quickly determine that (in O(log n) time) and the function returns false."
"Thus, using this data structure, every call to find_delete(key) adheres to the required O(log n) time bound."
"Note: While one might consider using an array with binary search, deletion from an array would cost O(n) (because of shifting elements), and hence a balanced BST is the better, more efficient choice in this context."
