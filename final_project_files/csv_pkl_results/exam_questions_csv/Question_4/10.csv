"Question: Given \( n \) distinct and sorted keys, describe an efficient data structure that maintains these keys (assume the structure is already built, so the cost of building it is not important) and supports the operation \( \text{find\_delete(key)} \), which receives a key and returns false if the key is not in the structure. If the key is in the structure, the operation returns true and removes it from the structure.  "
Required cost: \( O(\log n) \) for the \( \text{find\_delete(key)} \) operation.
"3o-mini: One efficient solution is to use a balanced binary search tree (BST), such as a redâ€“black tree or an AVL tree. These data structures maintain the keys in sorted order and support both search and deletion operations in O(log n) worst-case time."
How it works:
"1. When the find_delete(key) operation is called, the tree is searched for the key using the standard BST search procedure. This takes O(log n) time."
"2. If the key is found, the tree performs the deletion operation (which may involve rebalancing) to remove the key. This deletion operation also runs in O(log n) time."
"3. If the key is not in the tree, the search returns that fact, and the operation returns false."
"Thus, by using a balanced BST, you ensure that each call to find_delete(key) takes O(log n) time. "
"Note that we assume that the data structure is already built from the n sorted keys, so the one-time cost of constructing the tree is not an issue here."
