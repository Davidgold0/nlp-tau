Question: Given an array with $n$ numbers.
\textbf{B.} Describe a deterministic algorithm with time complexity $O(n \log n)$ that returns the number of distinct elements in the array. Prove your answer.
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem in our own words:
We need to design an algorithm that takes an array of n numbers and returns the number of distinct elements in the array. The algorithm should run in O(n log n) time. One common way to approach this problem is to first sort the array (which takes O(n log n) time) and then make one pass through the sorted array to count how many unique elements there are.
Here are the steps to follow:
1. Sort the array using an O(n log n) sorting algorithm.
"2. Iterate through the sorted array, comparing adjacent elements to count the number of times a new element appears, which will give us the count of distinct numbers."
3. Provide a brief argument or proof that this algorithm meets the required time complexity and correctness.
Let's start with the first step.
"Step 1: Decide on a sorting method. Which sorting approach do you think you could use to sort this array within O(n log n) time, and why would it work? Please explain your choice."
"Student: For sorting the array within \( O(n \log n) \) time, I think we could use the **Merge Sort** algorithm or **Heap Sort**. "
### Explanation of Choice:
1. **Merge Sort**:
"   - **Time Complexity**: Merge Sort has a guaranteed time complexity of \( O(n \log n) \) because it divides the array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together. The division and merging processes contribute to the logarithmic factor, while the linear factor comes from processing all elements."
"   - **Stability**: It is a stable sort, meaning that it preserves the relative order of equal elements, which can be useful in certain contexts."
2. **Heap Sort**:
   - **Time Complexity**: Heap Sort also runs in \( O(n \log n) \) time. It builds a max heap from the array and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element to build the sorted array. The heap operations (insertion and extraction) are logarithmic in nature due to the tree structure of the heap.
"   - **In-place**: Unlike Merge Sort, Heap Sort is an in-place algorithm, which means it requires less additional memory."
### Conclusion:
"Both sorting methods are valid choices, but I would lean toward **Merge Sort** for its simplicity and stability. "
"Would you like me to proceed to Step 2, where we iterate through the sorted array to count the distinct elements?"
"Teacher: Great job analyzing the sorting algorithms! You correctly explained that both Merge Sort and Heap Sort can sort an array in O(n log n) time and provided a solid reasoning for each choice. Your discussion shows a good understanding of the concepts, and choosing Merge Sort for its stability is perfectly valid."
"Now, let’s proceed to Step 2: counting the distinct elements in the sorted array."
"The idea here is that once the array is sorted, identical elements will be adjacent. What strategy would you use to iterate through the sorted array and count the number of unique elements? Please explain your approach or provide pseudocode for this step."
"Student: Student: To count the distinct elements in the sorted array, we can use a simple iteration strategy. Since the array is sorted, we can compare each element with the next one. Whenever we encounter a new element (i.e., an element that is different from the previous one), we can increase our count of distinct elements."
### Approach:
"1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of distinct elements, starting at 1 (since the first element is always distinct)."
2. Iterate through the sorted array starting from the second element.
"3. For each element, compare it with the previous element:"
"   - If it is different from the previous element, increment the counter."
4. Continue this until the end of the array.
### Pseudocode:
```plaintext
function countDistinctElements(sortedArray):
    if sortedArray is empty:
        return 0
    distinctCount = 1  // Start with the first element being distinct
    for i from 1 to length(sortedArray) - 1:
        if sortedArray[i] != sortedArray[i - 1]:
            distinctCount += 1
    return distinctCount
```
### Explanation:
- We start with a `distinctCount` of 1 because the first element is always counted as distinct.
"- The loop runs from the second element to the end of the array, checking if the current element is different from the previous one."
"- If they are different, we increment our `distinctCount`."
"- At the end of the loop, we return the total count of distinct elements."
Would you like me to summarize the entire algorithm and provide a proof of its time complexity?
"Teacher: Great work on outlining the approach and detailing the second step! Now, let's move on to the final step."
Step 3: Please summarize the entire algorithm—including both sorting and iterating to count distinct elements—and provide a justification (or proof) for its time complexity. Explain how the algorithm works overall and why its total time complexity is O(n log n).
Please share your summary and explanation for this final step.
Student: Student: Sure! Here’s a summary of the entire algorithm along with the justification for its time complexity.
### Summary of the Algorithm:
1. **Sorting the Array**:
"   - We begin by sorting the input array using an O(n log n) sorting algorithm, such as Merge Sort. This step rearranges the elements in ascending order, ensuring that any duplicate elements will be adjacent to each other."
2. **Counting Distinct Elements**:
"   - After sorting, we initialize a counter (`distinctCount`) to 1, as the first element is always counted as distinct."
"   - We then iterate through the sorted array starting from the second element. For each element, we compare it with the previous one:"
"     - If the current element is different from the previous element, we increment the `distinctCount`."
"   - Finally, we return the value of `distinctCount`, which represents the total number of distinct elements in the array."
### Pseudocode for the Entire Algorithm:
```plaintext
function countDistinctElements(array):
    sortedArray = mergeSort(array)  // Step 1: Sort the array
    if sortedArray is empty:
        return 0
    distinctCount = 1  // Start with the first element being distinct
    for i from 1 to length(sortedArray) - 1:
        if sortedArray[i] != sortedArray[i - 1]:
            distinctCount += 1
    return distinctCount  // Step 2: Return the count of distinct elements
```
### Justification of Time Complexity:
"- **Sorting Step**: The time complexity of the sorting step (using Merge Sort) is O(n log n). This is due to the algorithm's divide-and-conquer approach, where the array is repeatedly divided in half (log n divisions) and each division is processed linearly (O(n))."
"- **Counting Step**: The iteration through the sorted array takes O(n) time, as we simply make a single pass through the array to compare adjacent elements."
### Overall Time Complexity:
"- The total time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the most time-consuming step, which is the sorting step. Thus, the overall time complexity is:"
\[
O(n \log n) + O(n) = O(n \log n)
\]
This shows that the algorithm efficiently counts the number of distinct elements in the array while adhering to the required time complexity of O(n log n).
### Conclusion:
"In summary, our algorithm first sorts the array in O(n log n) time and then counts the distinct elements in O(n) time, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n log n). This approach is both efficient and straightforward, leveraging the properties of sorted arrays to simplify the counting process."

"3. The sorting step takes O(n log n) time while the counting step takes O(n) time, so overall the algorithm runs in O(n log n) time."
