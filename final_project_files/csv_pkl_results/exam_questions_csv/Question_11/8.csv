"Question: Given \( n \) segments on a line (each segment is defined by its start and end points). For simplicity, assume that all \( 2n \) points are distinct. A segment is called ""central"" if there are at least \( n/4 \) segments that start before it (i.e., their starting point is to the left of its starting point) and there are at least \( n/4 \) segments that end after it (i.e., their ending point is to the right of its ending point). Propose an algorithm that returns the number of central segments, with the best possible worst-case running time."
3o-mini: We can solve the problem in O(n) worst‐case time by “picking” two threshold points and then counting those segments that fall “in between.” The idea is as follows.
"Recall that a segment is defined by its starting point and ending point, and that all 2n endpoints are distinct. A segment is called central if"
"  (1) There are at least n/4 segments whose starting point is to the left (i.e. less than) its starting point, and  "
  (2) There are at least n/4 segments whose ending point is to the right (i.e. greater than) its ending point.
Step 1. Determine the starting‐point threshold.
"  – We want the segment’s starting point to be “later” than at least n/4 others. In other words, if you sorted all segments by their starting points in increasing order, the segment should not be among the leftmost n/4."
  – Using a linear‐time selection algorithm (for example using the median‐of‐medians approach) we can find the n/4–th smallest starting point (call it T_start). (Depending on your indexing convention you might want the n/4+1–th smallest point; the important part is that any segment whose starting point is greater than T_start has at least n/4 segments to its left.)
Step 2. Determine the ending‐point threshold.
"  – Similarly, we want the segment’s ending point to be “earlier” than at least n/4 other segments’ ending points. Equivalently, if you sorted all segments by their ending points in increasing order, the segment should not be among the rightmost n/4."
  – Use linear–time selection again to find the n/4–th largest ending point. (Often it is easier to think in terms of the (n – n/4 + 1)–th smallest ending point. Call it T_end.) Any segment with ending point less than T_end will have at least n/4 segments ending later (to its right).
Step 3. Count the central segments.
"  – Do a single scan through all the segments. For each segment, check if its starting point is greater than T_start and its ending point is less than T_end."
  – Count every segment that satisfies both conditions.
"Because the selection methods run in O(n) worst-case time and the final scan is O(n), the total worst-case running time is O(n)."
Note on details:
• The fact that all 2n endpoints are distinct guarantees that “greater than” is unambiguous.
• (Depending on whether you index from 0 or 1 you may need to adjust exactly which order statistic you choose; the idea is that a segment is “central” if it is not among the leftmost n/4 segments (by start) and not among the rightmost n/4 segments (by end).)
"This algorithm is optimal in the worst-case since any algorithm must look at all n segments, so the best possible time is Ω(n) and we have designed an O(n) algorithm."
"Thus, the algorithm is:"
"1. Use linear–time selection to find T_start, the n/4–th smallest starting point."
"2. Use linear–time selection to find T_end, the n/4–th largest ending point (or, equivalently, the (n – n/4 + 1)–th smallest ending point)."
"3. For each segment, if segment.start > T_start and segment.end < T_end then increment a counter."
4. Return the counter.
This achieves the desired result in O(n) worst-case time.
