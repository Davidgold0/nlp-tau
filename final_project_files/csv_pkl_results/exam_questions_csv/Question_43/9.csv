"Question: \textbf{We will implement a binary counter with $n$ bits. The counter is initialized to the value $0 \ldots 00$. The Inc operation advances the counter, meaning it increases its value by 1 as follows. The operation sequentially searches for the rightmost 0, turns it into a 1, and converts all 1's to its right into 0's. If the counter's state is $1 \ldots 11$, then advancing it will change its state to $00 \ldots 0$. For example, if $n=5$ and the counter state is currently $00111$, then after the Inc operation the counter state will be $01000$. After another Inc operation, the counter state will be $01001$. The cost of an operation is defined as the number of bits whose value is changed by the operation. For instance, the cost of advancing the counter in the example from $00111$ to $01000$ is 4, as 4 bits changed their value. The answers to the following sections need to be precise, not asymptotic in terms of $O(.)$. We will define a Double-Inc operation that calls for two consecutive Inc operations. What is the cost of the Double-Inc operation in the worst case? Explain.}"
"3o-mini: We first recall how an Inc operation works on an n‑bit binary counter. To increment a number x (in binary) by 1, the Inc operation searches from right (least‐significant bit) to left for the first 0. It then flips that 0 to 1 and turns all bits to its right into 0. (In the special case when x is 11…1, the whole counter becomes 00…0.) The cost of an Inc operation is defined as the number of bits whose values are changed during the operation."
"An Inc operation on an n‑bit counter will flip r+1 bits if the current counter has r trailing ones. Notice that the worst-case cost for a single Inc is n (this occurs when r = n – for example, when the counter is 11…1, all n bits are flipped to 0, costing n)."
Now consider a Double-Inc operation that performs two Inc’s in a row. We want to maximize the total number of bit flips (i.e. cost) over the two Inc operations.
Let’s examine two candidate “worst‐case” scenarios:
"1. First, suppose the counter is in the state 11…1 (all ones)."
"  – The first Inc finds no 0, so it flips all n bits to 0. This costs n."
  – The counter is now 00…0.
  – The second Inc proceeds by flipping the least-significant bit from 0 to 1 (since it searches from the right and finds a 0 immediately). This costs 1.
  – Total cost = n + 1.
"2. Alternatively, suppose the counter is in a state with a long string of 1’s at the right end. For example, let the counter be 0 1 1 … 1 (with n–1 ones at the end)."
"  – In the first Inc, the operation finds the leftmost 0 (which is the most-significant bit in this case) and flips it to 1, and then resets the trailing n–1 ones to 0. This again costs (n–1) + 1 = n."
  – The new state is 1 0 0 … 0.
"  – The second Inc then flips the least-significant bit, costing 1."
  – Total cost = n + 1.
"In any case, while an Inc operation can cost as much as n in the worst-case, the two consecutive Inc’s cannot both be worst-case simultaneously. If one costs n, the next will have a much lower cost (usually only 1). Thus, the worst-case cost for a Double-Inc is n + 1 bits flipped."
"To summarize, the worst-case scenario for the Double‑Inc operation is as follows:"
"– Starting with all ones (or with a pattern that gives an Inc cost of n), the first Inc flips n bits."
"– The counter becomes all zeros, and the next Inc costs 1."
"– Therefore, the total worst-case cost is n + 1."
"Hence, the precise answer is: The worst-case cost of a Double-Inc operation is n + 1."
