"Question: \textbf{We will implement a binary counter with $n$ bits. The counter is initialized to the value $0 \ldots 00$. The Inc operation advances the counter, meaning it increases its value by 1 as follows. The operation sequentially searches for the rightmost 0, turns it into a 1, and converts all 1's to its right into 0's. If the counter's state is $1 \ldots 11$, then advancing it will change its state to $00 \ldots 0$. For example, if $n=5$ and the counter state is currently $00111$, then after the Inc operation the counter state will be $01000$. After another Inc operation, the counter state will be $01001$. The cost of an operation is defined as the number of bits whose value is changed by the operation. For instance, the cost of advancing the counter in the example from $00111$ to $01000$ is 4, as 4 bits changed their value. The answers to the following sections need to be precise, not asymptotic in terms of $O(.)$. We will define a Double-Inc operation that calls for two consecutive Inc operations. What is the cost of the Double-Inc operation in the worst case? Explain.}"
3o-mini: We want to know the maximum (exact) total number of bit flips when we perform two Inc operations back‐to‐back (a “Double‐Inc”) on an n‐bit counter.
"Recall how the Inc operation works: It searches from the right for the first 0. When found, it flips that 0 to a 1 and sets every bit to its right to 0. (In the special case where the counter is all 1’s, the Inc operation “wraps” the counter around, setting every bit to 0. In that case the cost is n because all n bits change.)"
Let’s analyze two cases that yield the highest combined cost:
"1. Case 1 (High first Inc, then low second Inc):"
"  • Suppose the counter is in state 111…1 (all ones). Then the first Inc finds no 0 and “wraps” the counter, changing all n bits to 0. So the cost of the first Inc is n."
"  • Now the counter is 000…0. A subsequent Inc starts at all 0’s. The rightmost 0 is immediately found (at the least‐significant bit), and only that bit is flipped to 1. So the cost of the second Inc is 1."
  • Total cost = n + 1.
"2. Case 2 (Low first Inc, then high second Inc):"
"  • Alternatively, consider a situation like having the counter equal to 0 followed by all ones (i.e. 0 1 1 … 1). For example, with n = 5, this state would be 0 1 1 1 1. The first Inc will scan to the left until it finds the leftmost 0. In our example it will flip that 0 to 1 and set all the 1’s to its right to 0, so the cost is 1 (for the flipped 0) plus (n – 1) (for the ones that become 0), for a total of n in the first Inc."
"  • The new state will now be 1 0 0 … 0. When we perform Inc again, the rightmost bit is 0 so only 1 bit is changed."
"  • Again, the total cost is n + 1."
"In both cases, you cannot force a situation where both Inc’s cost n (or have a sum greater than n + 1) because the Inc operation, by its definition, “clears out” a long string of ones and leaves a tail of zeros. Therefore, one of the two Inc operations—in whichever order—can at best be the expensive one (cost n), while the other will be cheap (cost 1)."
"Thus, the worst‐case cost of a Double–Inc operation is exactly n + 1 bit flips."
