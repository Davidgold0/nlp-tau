Question: \begin{quote}
"In the following section, the initialization time and space complexity is O(1), and the space complexity at any given moment is O of the number of elements in the data structure. Describe how a vector of length m can be represented to support insertion at position i, reading from position i, and deletion at position i in O(\log m) worst-case time for each operation."

"3o-mini: One common solution is to represent the vector as a balanced binary search tree (such as an AVL tree, red–black tree, or weight–balanced tree) where each node stores not only an element but also the size of its subtree. This extra information allows you to “index” the tree—that is, to locate the i‑th element in O(log m) worst–case time. Here is a sketch of the idea:"
1. Initialization and Space Usage:
 • The empty tree takes O(1) time and space to initialize.
" • At any point, the total space is proportional to the number of elements (plus a constant amount of extra information per node), so the space complexity is O(m)."
2. Locating the i‑th Element (Reading):
 • Each node stores the size of its left subtree.
" • To locate the element at position i, start at the root. At any node, let L be the size of its left subtree:"
  – If i < L then the i‑th element is in the left subtree.
  – If i == L then the node’s element is the i‑th element.
  – If i > L then subtract L+1 from i and move to the right subtree.
" • Since the tree is balanced, this traversal takes O(log m) time."
3. Inserting at Position i:
" • To insert a new element at position i, first locate the position exactly as in the reading case."
 • Perform the insertion at the appropriate point in the tree (much like inserting into a binary search tree when its keys reflect the order of elements).
" • As you return from the recursion (or after the insertion), update the subtree sizes."
" • Rebalance the tree (using the specific balancing mechanism, e.g. tree rotations), which takes O(log m) worst–case time."
4. Deleting at Position i:
" • To delete the element at position i, find it using the same index–based search."
" • Remove the node (using, for example, the standard deletion procedure for binary search trees)."
 • Update the subtree sizes on the way back up and rebalance the tree as necessary.
" • Again, these operations take O(log m) worst–case time."
"This augmented, balanced tree representation supports random access, as well as insertions and deletions, each in O(log m) worst–case time per operation, exactly as required."
