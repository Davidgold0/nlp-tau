Question: \begin{quote}
"In the following section, the initialization time and space complexity is O(1), and the space complexity at any given moment is O of the number of elements in the data structure. Describe how a vector of length m can be represented to support insertion at position i, reading from position i, and deletion at position i in O(\log m) worst-case time for each operation."

"3o-mini: One standard solution is to use a balanced binary search tree (such as an AVL tree, red–black tree, or even an implicit treap) where each node stores one element along with an extra piece of information: the size of its subtree. This extra ""size"" field allows you to compute the rank of any node (or conversely, to locate the ith element) quickly."
Here’s how it works in more detail:
1. Initialization:  
"   You start with an empty tree. Creating an empty tree takes O(1) time, and its space usage is O(1) until elements are inserted."
2. Reading the element at position i:  
"   To read the ith element, you start at the root and use the subtree sizes to guide you. Suppose a node’s left child has s nodes.  "
"   • If i = s, then the current node holds the ith element.  "
"   • If i < s, then you move to the left child and search for position i there.  "
"   • If i > s, then you subtract s+1 (for the current node) from i and move to the right child.  "
"   Because the tree is balanced, this search takes O(log m) time."
3. Insertion at position i:  
"   To insert an element at position i, you first perform a similar search using the subtree sizes to locate the correct insertion point. When you add the new node (as a leaf or by adjusting the tree as needed), you update the subtree sizes of its ancestors. Since the search and updates both follow a path from the root to a leaf, the entire insertion also takes O(log m) worst-case time."
4. Deletion at position i:  
"   Deletion is handled similarly to insertion. First, locate the ith element using the subtree sizes. Then remove this node from the tree (which may involve swapping with a successor or predecessor and performing rebalancing as necessary). Along the way, update the subtree sizes of the affected nodes. Again, since you only traverse and update nodes along a root-to-leaf path, deletion takes O(log m) worst-case time."
"Since the tree is kept balanced, its height is O(log m), and therefore every operation—reading, inserting, or deleting at an arbitrary position—is guaranteed to run in O(log m) worst-case time. Moreover, at any moment the amount of space used is proportional to the number of elements currently stored."
"This approach meets all the criteria outlined: constant-time initialization, space usage linear in the number of elements, and O(log m) worst-case time operations for insertion, deletion, and random access."
