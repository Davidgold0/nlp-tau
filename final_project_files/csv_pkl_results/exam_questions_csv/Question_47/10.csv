Question: \begin{quote}
"In the following section, the initialization time and space complexity is O(1), and the space complexity at any given moment is O of the number of elements in the data structure. Describe how a vector of length m can be represented to support insertion at position i, reading from position i, and deletion at position i in O(\log m) worst-case time for each operation."

"3o-mini: One way to achieve O(log m) worst-case time for accessing, inserting, and deleting the i‑th element in a vector of length m is to represent the vector as a balanced binary search tree that is augmented with subtree sizes (often called an order‐statistic tree)."
Here’s how it works:
1. Initialization and Space:
 • Start with an empty tree. This takes O(1) time and space.
" • The tree’s nodes will be created on-demand as elements are inserted. At any time, the total space used is O(n) where n is the current number of elements in the vector."
2. Structure of Each Node:
 • Each node contains the value (or element) that you want to store.
" • Each node also stores an extra field: the size of the subtree rooted at that node (i.e., the number of nodes in the subtree including itself)."
" • The tree is kept balanced (using a self-balancing scheme like red-black trees, AVL trees, or weight-balanced trees) so that its height is O(log m)."
3. Reading from Position i:
" • To get the i‑th element (assuming positions are 0-indexed), start at the root."
 • Let L be the size of the left subtree of the current node.
" • If i = L, then the current node is the i‑th element."
" • If i < L, then continue recursively into the left subtree."
" • If i > L, then subtract (L + 1) from i and continue recursively into the right subtree."
" • Because the height is O(log m), this search takes O(log m) time."
4. Insertion at Position i:
" • To insert a new element at position i, use a similar approach: navigate the tree using the stored subtree sizes to find the correct position where the new element should go."
" • Once the location is found, insert the new node in the tree."
" • As you backtrack up the tree, update the subtree size of each node."
 • The balancing mechanism will ensure that this operation takes O(log m) time in the worst case.
5. Deletion at Position i:
" • To delete the element at position i, first locate it using the same method as in the read operation."
" • Remove the node from the tree, which may involve a tree rebalancing step."
 • Update the subtree sizes along the affected path.
" • Again, because the tree is balanced, the deletion process runs in O(log m) worst-case time."
"In summary, by representing the vector as an augmented balanced binary tree (an order‐statistic tree), each operation—whether reading the i‑th element, inserting at position i, or deleting at position i—requires O(log m) time. This method meets the criteria of constant initialization, O(m) space usage at any moment, and O(log m) worst-case time for each of the operations."
