Question: Given an array \( A \) containing \( n \) integers.  
"Given a number \( x \) that appears in \( A \), we define the multiplicity of \( x \) in array \( A \) as the number of times \( x \) appears in \( A \).  "
"We want to create a sorted array \( B \) of size \( n \), which will contain the multiplicity of each number appearing in \( A \).  "
Propose an algorithm that solves the problem with the best expected time complexity.  
3o-mini: We can solve the problem in overall expected O(n) time by “counting” the frequencies using a hash table and then using an integer‐sorting method (like counting sort) to sort the resulting B array.
"Suppose A[0…n–1] is our given array. First, note that when we say “the multiplicity of a number x,” we mean the number of times x occurs in A. What we need is a sorted array B (of size n) such that for every index i, B[i] equals the multiplicity of A[i]. For example, if"
"  A = [3, 5, 3, 1, 5, 5]"
then the multiplicities are:
"  frequency(3) = 2,"
"  frequency(5) = 3, and"
  frequency(1) = 1.
"Thus, the unsorted B would be:"
"  B = [2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3]"
and then sorting B gives:
"  Bsorted = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]."
Here is a step‐by‐step algorithm:
Step 1. Count the Frequencies.
  • Initialize an empty hash table T.
"  • For each element x in A, do:"
"    T[x] = T.get(x, 0) + 1."
  This runs in expected O(n) time if the hash table provides constant‐time operations on average.
Step 2. Build Array B.
  • Allocate an array B of size n.
"  • For each index i from 0 to n – 1, set:"
    B[i] = T[A[i]].
"  Again, this takes O(n) time."
Step 3. Sort Array B.
"  • Note that every value in B is an integer between 1 and n (the frequency of any element cannot exceed n). In this case, we can use a counting sort, which sorts integer keys in O(n + k) time, where here k is O(n). Hence, counting sort will run in O(n) time."
"  • Alternatively, any O(n log n) sorting algorithm would also work, but counting sort gives the best expected performance."
The overall time is thus O(n) + O(n) + O(n) = O(n) expected time.
Pseudocode:
-------------------------------------------------------------
function computeSortedFrequencies(A[0…n–1]):
    // Step 1: Compute frequency counts
    T ← new empty hash table
    for i from 0 to n–1 do:
        if T.containsKey(A[i]) then
            T[A[i]] ← T[A[i]] + 1
        else
            T[A[i]] ← 1
    // Step 2: Construct array B where B[i] is the frequency of A[i]
    B ← new array of size n
    for i from 0 to n–1 do:
        B[i] ← T[A[i]]
    // Step 3: Sort array B using counting sort (since values are between 1 and n)
"    B_sorted ← countingSort(B, range = 1 … n)"
    return B_sorted
-------------------------------------------------------------
"CountingSort(B, range) is assumed to be a standard counting sort implementation which runs in O(n + range) time."
"Thus, the best expected time complexity of the algorithm is O(n)."
