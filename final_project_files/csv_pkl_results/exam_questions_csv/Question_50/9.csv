"Question: Given two AVL trees of size \( n \) each, is it possible to merge them in \( O(\sqrt{n}) \) time? Prove using an algorithm or a contradiction."
"3o-mini: The answer depends on what you mean by “merge.” In many texts the “merge” of two AVL trees is defined only when every key in the first tree is less than every key in the second tree. In that case one may “join” (or “concatenate”) the two trees in O(log n) time, which is obviously also O(√n) since log n grows much slower than √n."
"However, if by “merge” you mean “take the union of two AVL trees whose elements are arbitrarily interleaved” (so that there is no global order in which one tree’s keys all come before the other’s) then the best known algorithms require Ω(n) time in the worst case. (In fact, for arbitrary sets the best algorithms for set-union via balanced trees take about O(n) time when the sizes of the two input trees are about the same.) "
I will elaborate on both cases.
───────────────────────────── 
Case 1. The “Join” of Two Ordered AVL Trees
"Assume that we have two AVL trees T₁ and T₂ with n nodes each, and that every key in T₁ is less than every key in T₂. In many balanced binary search tree implementations one can define a join operation that “glues” the two trees together. One typical algorithm is as follows:"
1. Compare the heights of T₁ and T₂. (Remember that in an AVL tree the height is O(log n).)
"2. Without loss of generality, assume T₁ is taller. Then walk down the right spine of T₁ until you reach a node whose right subtree has height approximately equal to that of T₂."
3. Create a new node (or “promote” an appropriate candidate) whose left child is the subtree of T₁ above the cut and whose right child is T₂.
4. Rebalance the tree as necessary.
"The key work here consists of descending a path whose length is O(log n) and then performing a constant number of rotations along that path. Thus the whole join operation runs in O(log n) time. Since log n is asymptotically much smaller than √n, one may say that merging the two trees (in the sense of “joining” them under the ordering constraint) is in O(√n) time."
───────────────────────────── 
Case 2. The “Union” (or “Merge”) of Two General AVL Trees
"Now suppose you want to merge two AVL trees T₁ and T₂ that have arbitrary keys (that is, their ranges are interleaved). In that case a “merge” must compute the union (or multiset union) of the two sets, and the obvious algorithm is:"
a. Traverse T₁ (or T₂) in order to produce a sorted array of its keys. This takes O(n) time.
b. Do the same for the other tree (again O(n) time).
c. Merge the two sorted arrays (which takes O(n) time—merging two sorted sequences always takes linear time).
d. Build a balanced AVL tree from the sorted array in O(n) time.
"Even if one were to try to “skirt around” the lower bound by using tree joins in a clever divide‐and‐conquer scheme, one would run into known lower bounds: in the worst case, any algorithm that “merges” the contents of two arbitrary (interleaved) sets must spend Ω(n) time just to read the input. (In other words, you can’t even output all the elements faster than linear time.)"
"Thus, if the trees are arbitrarily interleaved, it is not possible to merge them in O(√n) time."
───────────────────────────── 
Conclusion
"• If the two AVL trees are “joinable” (that is, every key in one is less than every key in the other), then you can merge them in O(log n) time—which is certainly O(√n) time."
"• If the two AVL trees have arbitrarily interleaved keys (so you must compute their union), then any algorithm must take Ω(n) time in the worst-case, so an O(√n) merger is not possible."
Any claim that one can merge two arbitrarily interleaved AVL trees in O(√n) time would contradict the fact that even simply reading (or “touching”) all n nodes cannot be done in sublinear time.
───────────────────────────── 
Final Answer
"It is possible to “merge” two AVL trees in O(√n) time only if you are in the easy case in which one tree’s keys are all less than the other’s (since then you can join them in O(log n) time). In the general case (merging arbitrarily interleaved sets) no algorithm can do better than Ω(n) time, so an O(√n) merge is impossible."
I hope this explanation clarifies the answer!
