"Question: Given two AVL trees of size \( n \) each, is it possible to merge them in \( O(\sqrt{n}) \) time? Prove using an algorithm or a contradiction."
"3o-mini: We will show that if the two AVL trees are “separated” in the sense that every key in the first tree is less than every key in the second tree, then one can merge (or “join”) them in O(log n) time. Since O(log n) is asymptotically a subset of O(√n) (because for all sufficiently large n we have log n < √n), the answer is “yes” in that situation. (We remark, however, that if the trees are arbitrary—that is, if their keys intermix—then the most natural merging routines take Ω(n) time; see the note at the end.)"
Below is an outline of the algorithm and its analysis in the “separated” case.

Outline of the O(log n) (and hence O(√n)) Merge Algorithm
Assumptions:
 • Tree A and Tree B are AVL trees of size n each.
 • Every key in Tree A is less than every key in Tree B.
Algorithm:
1. Find the maximum element in Tree A.
"   • In a binary search tree, the maximum is stored in the rightmost node."
"   • Because Tree A is balanced, this takes O(h_A) time, where the height h_A = O(log n)."
2. Delete this maximum element x from Tree A.
   • Deletion in an AVL tree takes O(log n) time.
3. Create a new node with key x.
   • Set its left child to be the new (balanced) Tree A (after deletion) and its right child to be Tree B.
   • This “join” puts x in the middle between all keys from Tree A and Tree B.
4. Rebalance the tree if necessary.
   • In a well‐designed join operation for AVL trees the rebalancing cost is proportional to the difference in the heights of the two trees.
"   • Since both heights are O(log n), the rebalancing takes O(|h_A – h_B|) = O(log n) time."
Time Analysis:
 • Finding the maximum in Tree A: O(log n)
 • Deleting the maximum from Tree A: O(log n)
 • Creating the new node and rebalancing: O(log n)
"Thus, the entire merge takes O(log n) time, which is clearly within O(√n) for sufficiently large n."

A Note About the General Case
"If the trees are not “separated” (i.e. if their keys are interleaved), one cannot simply join them as above. In that more general scenario one typically must “split” one tree (or both) according to the keys of the other and then perform many join operations. The best known algorithms for merging/intersecting two arbitrary balanced trees (or for doing set unions, for example) run in Ω(n) time in the worst case."

Conclusion
"So, under the assumption that all keys in the first tree are smaller than all keys in the second tree, one can merge two AVL trees of size n in O(log n) time. Since O(log n) ⊆ O(√n) (because for large n, √n is much larger than log n), we can indeed say that the trees may be merged in O(√n) time. However, if no such key-ordering is assumed (i.e. in the general case where the two trees’ keys are arbitrarily interleaved), then merging cannot be done in O(√n) time."
This completes the answer and the “proof” by showing an algorithm in the case where an O(√n) merge is possible.
