"Question: Given a node \( v \) in a red-black tree. \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) are the lengths of the shortest path and longest path from \( v \) to a leaf, respectively. Provide a lower bound on the ratio between \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \). Justify your answer."
"3o-mini: In a red-black tree every path from a node v to a leaf has the same number of black nodes (this number is known as the black-height, bh(v)). The shortest possible v-to-leaf path contains only these black nodes, while the longest path alternates between red and black nodes. Since red nodes cannot be consecutive, the longest path can have at most twice as many nodes as the black-height value."
Let bh(v) be the number of black nodes on any path from v to a leaf. Therefore:
  P₁ ≥ bh(v)
  P₂ ≤ 2 · bh(v)
"Thus, the ratio satisfies:"
  P₁/P₂ ≥ bh(v) / (2 · bh(v)) = 1/2
"So the lower bound on the ratio between the shortest and longest paths is 1/2. This bound is tight because in the worst-case scenario the longest path actually alternates between red and black nodes, achieving exactly twice the length of the shortest (all-black) path."
