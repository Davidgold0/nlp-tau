"Question: \textbf{Reminder:} In perfect hash, we choose a random universal hash function to map a given space \( U \) of size \( n \) to an array of size \( n \). Let \( n_i \) be the number of elements mapped to cell \( i \). Then, a random universal hash function is used to map the elements mapped to cell \( i \) to another array of size \( n_i^2 \)."
\textbf{Question:} 
"Define: A nearly universal family of functions is a family of functions from space \( U \) to \(\{0, \ldots, m-1\}\) such that for any pair of keys \( k_1, k_2 \) in \( U \) the condition \( \Pr(h[k_1] = h[k_2]) \leq 1/m^{0.5} \) holds. Suppose we have a nearly universal family when \( |U| = n \). We take a random function from the family and use it to map the elements of \( U \) to an array of size \( m \). What is the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions if \( m = n^4 \)?"
Teacher: Let's begin by outlining the steps we need to follow to solve this problem:
1. Restate the Problem in Your Own Words:  
"   We are given a nearly universal family of hash functions, meaning that for any two keys, the collision probability is at most 1/m^(0.5), where m is the size of the hash table. Here, m is n⁴. We need to find the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions when we hash all n elements."
2. Identify the Key Pieces of Information:  
   - Collision probability for any two distinct keys is ≤ 1/(m^(0.5)).  
"   - Since m = n⁴, 1/(m^(0.5)) simplifies to 1/n²."
   - The expected number of collisions can be estimated by summing the collision probabilities over all distinct pairs of keys.
3. Plan the Method:  
   - Step 1: Determine the number of distinct pairs among n keys.  
   - Step 2: Multiply that number by the collision probability per pair (which is ≤ 1/n²).  
   - Step 3: Simplify the resulting expression to get the final bound.
Let’s start with Step 1.
Please calculate the number of distinct pairs you can form from n keys. What expression do you get for that?
"Student: To calculate the number of distinct pairs that can be formed from \( n \) keys, we can use the combination formula for choosing 2 keys from \( n \) keys. "
The formula for the number of ways to choose 2 items from \( n \) is given by:
\[
\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]
"This expression counts the number of distinct pairs of keys. So, the number of distinct pairs we can form from \( n \) keys is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \). "
Would you like me to proceed to Step 2 and multiply this by the collision probability per pair?
Teacher: Great work! Your expression for the number of distinct pairs is correct.
"Now, let's move on to Step 2. We know that for any two keys, the collision probability is at most 1/n². "
"Please multiply the number of distinct pairs, n(n–1)/2, by this collision probability (1/n²) to set up the expression for the expected number of collisions. What expression do you get?"
"Student: To find the expected number of collisions, we will multiply the number of distinct pairs of keys, which we found to be \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), by the collision probability per pair, which is at most \( \frac{1}{n^2} \)."
"So, the expression for the expected number of collisions \( E \) can be set up as follows:"
\[
E \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{n^2}
\]
"Now, let's simplify this expression:"
\[
E \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2n^2} = \frac{n-1}{2n}
\]
This simplifies further to:
\[
E \leq \frac{1}{2} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)
\]
"As \( n \) becomes large, \( \frac{1}{n} \) approaches 0, and thus the expected number of collisions approaches \( \frac{1}{2} \)."
Would you like me to proceed to Step 3 and finalize the upper bound on the expected number of collisions?
"Teacher: You've done a great job simplifying the expression. To recap, we had:"
1. The number of distinct pairs of keys: (n(n – 1))/2.
2. Multiplying by the collision probability (at most 1/n²) gives:
  (n(n – 1))/(2n²) = (n – 1)/(2n).
"Now, please explain how you would interpret (n – 1)/(2n) as an upper bound for the expected number of collisions, especially for large n. What final answer would you give for the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions?"
"Student: To interpret the expression \( \frac{n - 1}{2n} \) as an upper bound for the expected number of collisions, we can analyze its behavior as \( n \) becomes large."
"1. **Understanding the Expression**: The expression \( \frac{n - 1}{2n} \) can be simplified to \( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2n} \). As \( n \) increases, the term \( \frac{1}{2n} \) approaches 0. Therefore, the expected number of collisions approaches \( \frac{1}{2} \)."
"2. **Final Interpretation**: This means that for sufficiently large \( n \), the expected number of collisions will be very close to \( \frac{1}{2} \). However, since we are looking for an upper bound, we can state that the expected number of collisions is at most \( \frac{1}{2} \) for large \( n \)."
"Thus, the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions when using a nearly universal family of hash functions to hash \( n \) elements into an array of size \( m = n^4 \) is:"
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}
\] 
"This upper bound indicates that even with a large number of elements, the expected number of collisions remains relatively low due to the properties of the nearly universal hash function."
"Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly interpreted the expression (n – 1)/(2n) as (1/2) – (1/(2n)), and as n grows large it approaches 1/2. This indicates that the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions is at most 1/2. "
