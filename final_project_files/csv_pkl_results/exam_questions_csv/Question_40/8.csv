"Question: \textbf{Reminder:} In perfect hash, we choose a random universal hash function to map a given space \( U \) of size \( n \) to an array of size \( n \). Let \( n_i \) be the number of elements mapped to cell \( i \). Then, a random universal hash function is used to map the elements mapped to cell \( i \) to another array of size \( n_i^2 \)."
\textbf{Question:} 
"Define: A nearly universal family of functions is a family of functions from space \( U \) to \(\{0, \ldots, m-1\}\) such that for any pair of keys \( k_1, k_2 \) in \( U \) the condition \( \Pr(h[k_1] = h[k_2]) \leq 1/m^{0.5} \) holds. Suppose we have a nearly universal family when \( |U| = n \). We take a random function from the family and use it to map the elements of \( U \) to an array of size \( m \). What is the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions if \( m = n^4 \)?"
"3o-mini: We have a nearly universal family of functions where for any two distinct keys k₁ and k₂, the probability of collision is at most 1/m^(0.5). Given m = n⁴, this means that for any pair we have:"
  Pr[h(k₁) = h(k₂)] ≤ 1/(n⁴)^(0.5) = 1/n².
"Since there are (n choose 2) = n(n − 1)/2 distinct pairs of keys in U, by linearity of expectation, the expected number of collisions is at most:"
  Expected Collisions ≤ (n(n − 1)/2) × (1/n²)
           = (n² − n)/(2n²)
           ≈ ½ (for large n).
"Thus, the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions is at most ½, which is O(1) in terms of n."
