"Question: \textbf{Reminder:} In perfect hash, we choose a random universal hash function to map a given space \( U \) of size \( n \) to an array of size \( n \). Let \( n_i \) be the number of elements mapped to cell \( i \). Then, a random universal hash function is used to map the elements mapped to cell \( i \) to another array of size \( n_i^2 \)."
\textbf{Question:} 
"Define: A nearly universal family of functions is a family of functions from space \( U \) to \(\{0, \ldots, m-1\}\) such that for any pair of keys \( k_1, k_2 \) in \( U \) the condition \( \Pr(h[k_1] = h[k_2]) \leq 1/m^{0.5} \) holds. Suppose we have a nearly universal family when \( |U| = n \). We take a random function from the family and use it to map the elements of \( U \) to an array of size \( m \). What is the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions if \( m = n^4 \)?"
"3o-mini: We have n keys in U and we choose a random function from a nearly universal family. The condition given is that for any two distinct keys k₁ and k₂, the probability that they hash to the same value is at most 1/m^(0.5). Since m = n⁴, we have:"
  1/m^(0.5) = 1/(n⁴)^(0.5) = 1/(n²).
"Now, consider all pairs of distinct keys. There are C(n, 2) = n(n−1)/2 such pairs. For each pair, the probability that they collide is at most 1/(n²). Hence, by linearity of expectation, the expected total number of collisions is at most:"
  E[collisions] ≤ (n(n−1)/2) · (1/(n²)).
"Simplifying this, we get:"
  E[collisions] ≤ (n(n−1))/(2n²) = (n−1)/(2n).
"For any n ≥ 1, (n−1)/(2n) is less than 1/2. For large n, this expression approaches 1/2."
"Thus, the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions is at most 1/2."
