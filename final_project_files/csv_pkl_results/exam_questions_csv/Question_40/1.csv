"Question: \textbf{Reminder:} In perfect hash, we choose a random universal hash function to map a given space \( U \) of size \( n \) to an array of size \( n \). Let \( n_i \) be the number of elements mapped to cell \( i \). Then, a random universal hash function is used to map the elements mapped to cell \( i \) to another array of size \( n_i^2 \)."
\textbf{Question:} 
"Define: A nearly universal family of functions is a family of functions from space \( U \) to \(\{0, \ldots, m-1\}\) such that for any pair of keys \( k_1, k_2 \) in \( U \) the condition \( \Pr(h[k_1] = h[k_2]) \leq 1/m^{0.5} \) holds. Suppose we have a nearly universal family when \( |U| = n \). We take a random function from the family and use it to map the elements of \( U \) to an array of size \( m \). What is the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions if \( m = n^4 \)?"
"Teacher: Let’s start by breaking down the problem into manageable steps. We have a nearly universal hash family with the property that for any two distinct keys, the probability they land in the same cell is at most 1/√m. In our case, m = n⁴, so what would 1/√m be in terms of n?"
"Before we get to that, let’s begin by considering the pairs being hashed. "
Step 1: Determine the total number of distinct pairs of keys from a set U of size n. 
Please calculate the number of distinct pairs among n keys. What expression do you get for the number of pairs?
"Student: To determine the total number of distinct pairs of keys from a set \( U \) of size \( n \), we can use the combination formula. The number of ways to choose 2 keys from \( n \) keys is given by:"
\[
\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]
This expression represents the number of distinct pairs of keys in the set \( U \). 
"So, for \( n \) keys, the number of distinct pairs is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \). "
"Is that what you were looking for, or do you want to go further with this?"
Teacher: That's correct! You've calculated that the number of distinct pairs is n(n – 1)/2. Great job on that!
"Now for Step 2: Since m = n⁴, we need to determine the collision probability for any pair of distinct keys, which is given as 1/√m. Can you express 1/√m in terms of n? Please work on that next step."
"Student: To express \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}} \) in terms of \( n \), we start with the given value of \( m \):"
\[
m = n^4
\]
"Now, we can calculate \( \sqrt{m} \):"
\[
\sqrt{m} = \sqrt{n^4} = n^2
\]
"Thus, the collision probability for any pair of distinct keys becomes:"
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}} = \frac{1}{n^2}
\]
"So, \( \Pr(h[k_1] = h[k_2]) \leq \frac{1}{n^2} \). "
Is this the correct expression you were looking for? What should we do next?
Teacher: Great job! You've correctly derived that 1/√m = 1/n². 
"Now, let's move to the next step."
Step 3: We want to calculate the expected number of collisions. Recall that each distinct pair of keys (and we have n(n – 1)/2 pairs) has a collision probability of at most 1/n². 
Please use these pieces of information to write an expression for the expected number of collisions among all pairs. What expression do you get when you multiply the total number of pairs by the collision probability for each pair?
"Student: To find the expected number of collisions among all pairs of keys, we can use the total number of distinct pairs we calculated earlier, which is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), and multiply it by the collision probability for each pair, which we found to be \( \frac{1}{n^2} \)."
"So, the expected number of collisions \( E \) can be expressed as:"
\[
E = \text{(Number of pairs)} \times \text{(Collision probability)}
\]
Substituting the values we have:
\[
E = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \times \frac{1}{n^2}
\]
"Now, simplifying this expression:"
\[
E = \frac{n(n-1)}{2n^2} = \frac{n-1}{2n}
\]
"Thus, the expected number of collisions is:"
\[
E = \frac{n-1}{2n}
\]
This expression indicates the expected number of collisions when using a nearly universal hash function with the given parameters. Is there anything else you would like me to do with this result?
Teacher: You've done a great job working through the steps so far! Let's review:
1. We determined the number of distinct pairs from n keys is n(n – 1)/2.
"2. Given that m = n⁴, we computed 1/√m = 1/n²."
3. Multiplying the total number of pairs by the collision probability per pair gave the expected number of collisions as:  
  E = [n(n – 1)/2] · (1/n²) = (n – 1)/(2n).
"Your expression for E = (n – 1)/(2n) is correct. For large n, this value is roughly 1/2, which provides a tight bound."
"If you feel confident with this reasoning, then the final answer is:"
(n-1)/(2n)$
