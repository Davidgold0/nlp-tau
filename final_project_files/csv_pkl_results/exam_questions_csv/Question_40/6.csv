"Question: \textbf{Reminder:} In perfect hash, we choose a random universal hash function to map a given space \( U \) of size \( n \) to an array of size \( n \). Let \( n_i \) be the number of elements mapped to cell \( i \). Then, a random universal hash function is used to map the elements mapped to cell \( i \) to another array of size \( n_i^2 \)."
\textbf{Question:} 
"Define: A nearly universal family of functions is a family of functions from space \( U \) to \(\{0, \ldots, m-1\}\) such that for any pair of keys \( k_1, k_2 \) in \( U \) the condition \( \Pr(h[k_1] = h[k_2]) \leq 1/m^{0.5} \) holds. Suppose we have a nearly universal family when \( |U| = n \). We take a random function from the family and use it to map the elements of \( U \) to an array of size \( m \). What is the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions if \( m = n^4 \)?"
"3o-mini: We have a nearly universal set of functions with the property that for any two distinct keys k₁ and k₂ in U,"
  Pr[h(k₁) = h(k₂)] ≤ 1/m^(0.5).
"Given that |U| = n and m = n⁴, the collision probability for any pair is at most"
  1/(n⁴)^(0.5) = 1/n².
"There are C(n, 2) = n(n – 1)/2 pairs of keys in U. Therefore, by linearity of expectation, the expected total number of collisions is at most"
  (n(n – 1)/2) · (1/n²).
"Simplifying, we get"
  = (n(n – 1))/(2n²)
  = (1 – 1/n)/2.
"Thus, for large n, the expected number of collisions is less than 1/2. "
"So the best upper bound on the expected number of collisions is (1 – 1/n)/2, which is less than 1/2."
