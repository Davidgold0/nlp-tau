"Question: We insert a set of elements \( X_1 \) of size \( n_1 \) into a hashing table of size \( m \) using the chaining method with the hashing function \( h \). All the linked lists formed in this table had a length of at most \( k_1 \). We then insert a second set of elements \( X_2 \) of size \( n_2 \) into another hashing table of size \( m \), also using the chaining method with the same hashing function \( h \). The linked lists formed in this table had a length of at most \( k_2 \). Finally, we insert all the elements of \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \), in some order, into a third hashing table of size \( m \), again using the chaining method and the same hashing function \( h \). Provide a non-asymptotic bound, as tight as possible, on the number of keys that will be examined during a search operation (whether successful or unsuccessful) in the third hashing table."
Teacher: Let’s start by rephrasing the problem in our own words and then break it into small steps.
Rephrased problem:
• You have a hashing table of size m where keys are stored using chaining.
"• First, when you insert set X₁ (with n₁ items) using a hash function h, every chain (linked list) in the table has at most k₁ items."
"• Second, when you insert a different set X₂ (with n₂ items) with the same table size and hash function, every chain has at most k₂ items."
"• Now, when all elements from both X₁ and X₂ are inserted (the order is arbitrary) into a new table of the same size with the same hash function, you want to know the tightest non-asymptotic bound on the number of keys that may need to be examined during a search (whether the search is successful or not)."
The guiding idea behind the solution is to understand that:
"1. For any bucket (i.e., any output of h), the maximum number of elements coming from X₁ that could land there is k₁ (from the first table) and similarly k₂ for X₂ (from the second table)."
"2. In the combined table, if a bucket receives keys from both sets, the worst-case chain length (and hence the number of keys examined during a search) would be the sum of those two contributions."
"3. Therefore, the worst-case number of keys examined would be bounded by the sum k₁ + k₂."
"To start our guided process, please tackle the very first step:"
"Step 1: Explain why, for any given bucket produced by the hash function h, the number of keys from X₁ is at most k₁ and the number from X₂ is at most k₂. What does this tell us about the distribution of keys into buckets when the sets are processed separately?"
Share your thoughts or answer for just this step.
"Student: In step 1, we need to explain why, for any given bucket produced by the hash function \( h \), the number of keys from \( X_1 \) is at most \( k_1 \) and the number from \( X_2 \) is at most \( k_2 \)."
"When we inserted the elements from set \( X_1 \) into the first hashing table, the problem states that every linked list (or chain) in that table had a maximum length of \( k_1 \). This means that, regardless of the distribution of keys across the buckets, no single bucket could contain more than \( k_1 \) elements from \( X_1 \). This is due to the way the chaining method works; each bucket can only hold a limited number of keys based on how they were hashed and inserted."
"Similarly, when we inserted the elements from set \( X_2 \) into the second hashing table, each linked list had a maximum length of \( k_2 \). Therefore, for any bucket in that table, the number of keys from \( X_2 \) could not exceed \( k_2 \)."
"This tells us that when the sets \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) are processed separately, the distribution of keys into the buckets is limited by the lengths of the chains established during their individual insertions. Specifically, it implies that the worst-case scenario for any given bucket is that it could contain at most \( k_1 \) keys from \( X_1 \) and at most \( k_2 \) keys from \( X_2 \) when we consider the two sets together."
"In summary, for any bucket produced by the hash function \( h \):"
- The number of keys from \( X_1 \) is at most \( k_1 \).
- The number of keys from \( X_2 \) is at most \( k_2 \).
This understanding lays the groundwork for determining how many keys may be examined during a search in the combined table. 
Is there anything you would like me to clarify or expand upon in this explanation?
"Teacher: Great job on step 1! Your explanation is clear and shows that you understand why no bucket in the separate insertions can have more than k₁ or k₂ keys from X₁ and X₂, respectively."
"Now, let’s move on to the next step."
"Step 2: Consider the combined table where all elements of X₁ and X₂ are inserted in some order. Explain how, for any given bucket, you can deduce that the maximum number of keys it might contain is the sum of the keys from X₁ and X₂. In other words, outline why the worst-case chain length in the third table is at most k₁ + k₂. "
Give it a try by explaining your reasoning for this step.
"Student: In step 2, we need to analyze the combined hashing table where all elements from sets \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) are inserted together. We want to determine why the maximum number of keys that any given bucket might contain is the sum of the keys from \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \), leading to a worst-case chain length of at most \( k_1 + k_2 \)."
"When we insert the elements from \( X_1 \) into the first table, we established that for any bucket produced by the hash function \( h \), the maximum number of keys from \( X_1 \) is \( k_1 \). This means that in the worst-case scenario, each bucket can hold up to \( k_1 \) keys from \( X_1 \)."
"Now, when we insert the elements from \( X_2 \) into the second table, we similarly established that the maximum number of keys from \( X_2 \) in any bucket is \( k_2 \)."
"When we combine both sets into the new hashing table, the same hash function \( h \) is used to determine the bucket for each key. Since the hashing function is deterministic, the same key will hash to the same bucket regardless of whether it comes from \( X_1 \) or \( X_2 \)."
"In the worst-case scenario for any given bucket, it could contain:"
"- Up to \( k_1 \) keys from \( X_1 \) (as established from the first table),"
- And up to \( k_2 \) keys from \( X_2 \) (as established from the second table).
"Thus, in the combined table, the total number of keys in that bucket can be at most \( k_1 + k_2 \). This is because the keys from both sets can coexist in the same bucket, leading to a combined chain length."
"Therefore, we can conclude that the worst-case chain length in the third table, where all elements from both sets are inserted, is at most \( k_1 + k_2 \). This understanding is crucial for determining the number of keys that might be examined during a search operation."
"Would you like me to proceed to the next step, or is there anything you would like to discuss further?"
"Teacher: Great work on step 2! Your explanation clearly shows that if, for any bucket, there can be at most k₁ keys coming from X₁ and at most k₂ keys coming from X₂, then when we combine the two sets in the new table the total number of keys in any bucket is at most k₁ + k₂."
"Now, let’s move on to step 3."
"Step 3: Think about the search operation in a chaining hash table. Whether the search is successful or not, during the operation we will examine the entire chain in the bucket where the key hashes. With the worst-case chain length determined as k₁ + k₂ from our analysis so far, explain how you arrive at the non-asymptotic bound on the number of keys examined during a search operation."
"Please share your explanation for this final step, focusing only on why k₁ + k₂ is the tight bound on the number of keys examined."
"Student: In step 3, we need to analyze the search operation in a chaining hash table and explain how we arrive at the non-asymptotic bound on the number of keys examined during the search, which we determined to be \( k_1 + k_2 \)."
"When we perform a search operation in a chaining hash table, we first compute the hash of the key we are searching for using the hash function \( h \). This hash function will direct us to a specific bucket in the table. The next step is to examine the linked list (or chain) of keys stored in that bucket."
"From our previous steps, we established that the worst-case chain length for any bucket in the combined table is at most \( k_1 + k_2 \). This means that when we search for a key, whether the search is successful (the key is found) or unsuccessful (the key is not found), we will need to traverse the entire chain in the bucket where the key hashes."
"1. **Successful Search**: If the key is present in the bucket, we will traverse the chain, examining each key until we find the target key. In the worst case, we may need to look through all \( k_1 + k_2 \) keys in that bucket."
"2. **Unsuccessful Search**: If the key is not present, we will still traverse the entire chain to confirm its absence. Again, this means we will examine all \( k_1 + k_2 \) keys in the worst-case scenario."
"Thus, regardless of whether the search is successful or unsuccessful, the maximum number of keys that we will examine during the search operation is bounded by \( k_1 + k_2 \)."
"Therefore, the non-asymptotic bound on the number of keys examined during a search operation in the third hashing table is \( k_1 + k_2 \). This is a tight bound because it directly reflects the maximum length of the chain in any bucket, which we established through our analysis."
"If you have any further questions or if there's anything else you'd like to clarify, please let me know!"
"Teacher: Excellent work working through step 3! Your reasoning is correct: in a chaining hash table, the search operation involves examining the entire linked list in the target bucket, and because in the worst case this list has at most k₁ keys from X₁ and at most k₂ keys from X₂, the total number of keys examined is bounded by k₁ + k₂."
"Since you've carefully explained each step and reached the final conclusion, the tight non-asymptotic bound on the number of keys examined during a search operation in the combined table is:"
k₁ + k₂$
