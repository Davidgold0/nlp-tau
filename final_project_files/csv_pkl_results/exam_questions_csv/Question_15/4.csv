"Question: We insert a set of elements \( X_1 \) of size \( n_1 \) into a hashing table of size \( m \) using the chaining method with the hashing function \( h \). All the linked lists formed in this table had a length of at most \( k_1 \). We then insert a second set of elements \( X_2 \) of size \( n_2 \) into another hashing table of size \( m \), also using the chaining method with the same hashing function \( h \). The linked lists formed in this table had a length of at most \( k_2 \). Finally, we insert all the elements of \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \), in some order, into a third hashing table of size \( m \), again using the chaining method and the same hashing function \( h \). Provide a non-asymptotic bound, as tight as possible, on the number of keys that will be examined during a search operation (whether successful or unsuccessful) in the third hashing table."
Teacher: Let’s begin by rephrasing the problem in our own words to ensure we understand it well:
"We have two sets of elements, X₁ and X₂, which were each inserted into separate hash tables using chaining. In the first table (with X₁), every bucket’s linked list is no longer than k₁, and in the second table (with X₂), every linked list is no longer than k₂. Now, if we insert all elements from X₁ and X₂ into a third hash table (using the same hash function h and the same table size m), we want to determine a tight, non-asymptotic (exact) upper bound on the number of keys that must be examined when performing a search (either successful or unsuccessful)."
"To figure this out, here is a suggested outline of the steps we might take:"
1. Analyze how the separate bounds of k₁ for X₁ and k₂ for X₂ affect the overall chain length in the third table.
2. Think about what happens at any particular bucket in the third table. How many elements from X₁ could hash there (given k₁ bounds from the first table)? How many from X₂? 
3. Combine these observations to obtain the maximum possible number of elements in any bucket in the third table.
4. Conclude with the overall bound on the number of keys examined during a search.
"Now, let’s take the first step:"
"Step 1: Consider the contributions from the two sets separately. How would you describe the maximum possible number of elements from X₁ that could end up in a single bucket in the third table? And similarly, what is the maximum contribution from X₂, based on the information provided?"
Please explain your thoughts on this step.
Student: Sure! Let's break down Step 1.
"For the first set of elements \( X_1 \) of size \( n_1 \), we know that when they were inserted into the first hashing table, the longest linked list in any bucket was at most \( k_1 \). This means that for any specific bucket in the first table, there could be at most \( k_1 \) elements from \( X_1 \) that hash to that bucket."
"Now, when we insert all elements from \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) into the third hash table, we need to consider how many of those elements could end up in the same bucket. Since we are using the same hashing function \( h \) and the same table size \( m \), the distribution of elements across buckets remains consistent."
"So, for \( X_1 \):"
"- In the worst-case scenario, all \( k_1 \) elements from any bucket in the first table could hash to the same bucket in the third table."
"Now, for the second set of elements \( X_2 \) of size \( n_2 \), we have a similar situation. The longest linked list in any bucket was at most \( k_2 \). This means that for any specific bucket in the second table, there could also be at most \( k_2 \) elements from \( X_2 \) that hash to that bucket."
In summary:
- The maximum number of elements from \( X_1 \) that could hash to a single bucket in the third table is \( k_1 \).
- The maximum number of elements from \( X_2 \) that could hash to a single bucket in the third table is \( k_2 \).
"Would you like me to move on to Step 2, where we consider the total contribution to a single bucket in the third table?"
Teacher: Great work on clarifying Step 1! Your reasoning that at most k₁ elements from X₁ and at most k₂ elements from X₂ can hash to any given bucket is spot on.
"Now, let’s move on to Step 2:"
"Step 2: In the third hash table, both sets X₁ and X₂ are inserted using the same hash function h. Considering the worst-case scenario for any single bucket, what do you think is the maximum number of elements (i.e., the maximum chain length) that could appear in that bucket? Please provide an expression or explanation that sums the contributions from X₁ and X₂."
Take your time and solve this next step.
"Student: Student: Thank you for your guidance! Now, let's analyze Step 2."
"In the third hash table, when we insert all elements from both sets \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \), we need to consider how the contributions from both sets can combine in any single bucket."
"From our previous step, we established that:"
- The maximum number of elements from \( X_1 \) that could hash to a single bucket is \( k_1 \).
- The maximum number of elements from \( X_2 \) that could hash to a single bucket is \( k_2 \).
"Since we are inserting all elements from both sets into the same third hash table using the same hash function \( h \), we can combine these contributions."
"In the worst-case scenario for any specific bucket in the third table, the maximum number of elements that could hash to that bucket would be the sum of the maximum contributions from both sets:"
\[
\text{Maximum elements in a single bucket} = k_1 + k_2
\]
"This means that in the worst case, a single bucket could have \( k_1 \) elements from \( X_1 \) and \( k_2 \) elements from \( X_2 \)."
"Shall we move on to Step 3, where we can conclude with the overall bound on the number of keys examined during a search operation in the third hash table?"
Teacher: You're doing a great job! You've correctly summed the contributions to a single bucket and arrived at k₁ + k₂ as the worst-case length. 
"Now, let's move on to Step 3:"
"Step 3: We need to conclude on the overall bound on the number of keys examined during a search operation in the third hash table. Keeping in mind that whether the search is successful or unsuccessful, you would at most have to compare against all the keys in the bucket, how would you express a non-asymptotic bound on the search cost using k₁ and k₂?"
Please provide just your reasoning for the final bound.
"Student: Thank you for your guidance! Now, let's analyze Step 3."
"In the third hash table, during a search operation (whether successful or unsuccessful), we will need to examine the keys in the bucket where the searched key hashes. "
"From our previous analysis, we established that in the worst-case scenario, any single bucket in the third table can contain at most \( k_1 + k_2 \) elements. Therefore, when we perform a search, we will have to examine each of these elements in that bucket."
"Thus, the maximum number of keys that will be examined during a search operation in the third hash table is:"
\[
\text{Total keys examined during search} = k_1 + k_2
\]
This expression gives us a non-asymptotic bound on the number of keys examined during a search operation in the third hash table.
"Would you like me to summarize the entire solution, or is there anything else you'd like to clarify?"
"Teacher: Great job working through the problem! To summarize briefly: We observed that, due to the chaining method, each bucket in the first table can contain at most k₁ elements and each bucket in the second table at most k₂ elements. When all elements from X₁ and X₂ are inserted into the third table using the same hash function, any given bucket can contain at most k₁ + k₂ elements. Therefore, in the worst-case scenario, a search—whether successful or unsuccessful—would examine at most k₁ + k₂ keys."
