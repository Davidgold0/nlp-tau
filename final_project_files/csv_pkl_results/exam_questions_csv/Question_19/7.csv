"Question: Describe a data structure whose elements are pairs of keys \( (a, b) \), where each left key in the pair is an integer in the range \([1, 10n]\). It can be assumed that all the key pairs are distinct. The data structure should support the following operations (where \( n \) is the number of key pairs currently in the data structure):"
\begin{itemize}
"    \item \texttt{Insert(a, b)} – Adds the key pair \( (a, b) \) to the data structure. The operation should be performed in amortized time \( O(1) \)."
"    \item \texttt{IncreaseKey((a, b), x)} – This command receives a pointer to the key pair \( (a, b) \) that is in the data structure and a positive number \( x \), and increases the right key by \( x \). The operation should be performed in amortized time \( O(1) \)."
"    \item \texttt{Delete((a, b))} – This command receives a pointer to the key pair \( (a, b) \) that is in the data structure and deletes it. The operation should be performed in amortized time \( O(\log n) \)."
\end{itemize}
"3o-mini: One acceptable answer is to use a “heap‐with‐direct‐access”–style data structure. In particular, you can store the pairs (a,b) in a Fibonacci heap (or a very similar heap‐structure) keyed by b, but also “index” each element by its left key a via a direct–address table. (Any answer equivalent to the answer described below is correct.)"
Here is one way to describe the design and why it meets the required bounds:
────────────────────────────
1. The idea
"We are given that every left key a is an integer in [1,10n] (where n is the current number of pairs). This means that even though n is changing, the range of possible a’s is “small” (within a constant factor of n) and we can afford to “direct–address” (or use an array/hash table with constant–time lookup) on the left key. Meanwhile, we want to support the following operations on our set S of pairs:"
"  – Insert(a,b) in amortized O(1)"
"  – IncreaseKey((a,b), x) in amortized O(1) (the pointer to the pair is given)"
"  – Delete((a,b)) in amortized O(log n) (again, given the pointer)"
"One standard data structure that comes very close to these bounds is the Fibonacci heap. (Usually Fibonacci heaps are used for minimum–priority queues with Insert and DecreaseKey in O(1) amortized and Delete in O(log n) amortized.) In our case we want to “increase” the key b rather than decrease it. (In many applications—say, when the heap is actually used for “scheduling” or “network‐optimization”—one needs increase–key operations.) It turns out that if the keys only move in one direction (only increase) then a slight “reversal” of the usual Fibonacci heap operations will work. (Alternatively, you can “flip” the order and work with a max–Fibonacci heap.) In any event, one may show that by a proper lazy update, the IncreaseKey operation can be done in O(1) amortized time, while keeping Delete in O(log n) amortized time."
"The remaining issue is how to “find” a given key pair quickly for IncreaseKey and Delete. (Note that you receive a pointer to the key pair, so you already have direct access to it in the heap’s internal structure.) However, when you insert an element this pointer must also be “recorded” somewhere if later you want to do something like search by a. Thus, we maintain an auxiliary direct–address table T of size O(n) (in fact, of length 10n or a slightly larger number to allow re–allocation as n changes). When you call Insert(a,b) you allocate a node in the Fibonacci heap (or heap–of–choice) for (a,b) and in constant time also store its pointer in T at position a. (Since the left keys lie in a small (linear–in–n) range, a direct–access table or even a hash table with constant expected time gives O(1) time per operation.) In this way, IncreaseKey((a,b), x) merely uses the pointer to update the b field (and then does the “lazy” adjustments in the heap if necessary), and Delete((a,b)) uses the pointer to remove the element from the Fibonacci heap (which takes O(log n) amortized time in a Fibonacci heap)."
────────────────────────────
2. Putting it together
• Data structures:
" – A Fibonacci heap H that is “ordered” by the b–value. (It will be a min– or a max–heap depending on how you want to treat the IncreaseKey operation. For example, if all IncreaseKey operations raise b and you wish the smallest b to be near the “top” then you might “flip” the comparison so that a larger b is considered to have higher priority. In any event, the important part is that Insert and IncreaseKey are done by simply adding a node or updating a node’s b–value, respectively.)"
 – A direct–access table T[1…10n] that “indexes” the nodes of H by the left key a.
• Operations:
" Insert(a,b):"
  – Allocate a new node x (containing a and b) and insert it into H. (Fibonacci heap insertion is O(1) amortized.)
  – Set T[a] ← pointer to x.
  → Total cost: O(1) amortized.
" IncreaseKey((a,b), x):"
"  – Because the pointer is given, go directly to the node."
"  – Increase its b–value by x. (This might “violate” the heap–order; however, since b increases only, one may “fix” the violation by doing a lazy reorganization. In many Fibonacci heap variants the analogous DecreaseKey is done in O(1) amortized time—and here the situation is similar.)"
  → Total cost: O(1) amortized.
" Delete((a,b)):"
"  – Using the pointer, remove the node from H. (The deletion in a Fibonacci heap is known to take O(log n) amortized time.)"
"  – Also, “remove” the pointer from T (or mark it as deleted)."
  → Total cost: O(log n) amortized.

3. Final comments
This design “splits” the data structure into two parts:
 • The direct–access table provides constant–time update by the left key.
 • The Fibonacci–heap–like structure provides the necessary “heap–order” so that the IncreaseKey and especially the Delete operation (which needs to “consolidate” trees) run in the required amortized time bounds.
"Any solution that uses a similar idea—a direct–addressed (or hash–table) component to handle the left key and a heap (Fibonacci heap, pairing heap with the proper guarantees, etc.) to handle the right key updates and deletions—is acceptable."
────────────────────────────
Answer Summary
"We design our data structure as follows. (1) Store each pair (a,b) as a node in a Fibonacci heap keyed on b. In a slight variant of the usual Fibonacci heap (or by “reversing” the usual order), the IncreaseKey operation (which increases b) can be performed in O(1) amortized time. (2) Since each left key a is in [1, 10n], we also maintain a direct–access table T indexed by a so that given the pointer to an element one can update or delete it. (3) Thus, Insert(a,b) is done by creating a new node (which takes O(1) amortized time), IncreaseKey((a,b), x) is done by directly accessing and updating the node (O(1) amortized), and Delete((a,b)) is performed by deleting the node from the Fibonacci heap (O(log n) amortized). "
Any answer equivalent to the above is correct.
