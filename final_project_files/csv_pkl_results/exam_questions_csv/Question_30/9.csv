"Question: Is it possible to implement any search tree such that the insert operation takes \( O(1) \) in the worst case and the delete operation takes \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the tree?"
"3o-mini: It turns out that if by “search tree” you mean a data structure that supports fast (say, logarithmic‐time) lookup by key (i.e. it maintains the binary search tree property in order to support ordered queries efficiently) then you cannot “cheat” and have every insertion run in O(1) worst‐case time. In any “proper” search tree, an insert must at least locate the right place in the tree (or, in balanced trees, it must do additional rotations or fixups) so that the new key is in order. Even in the simplest balanced trees the insertion cost is on the order of log n in the worst case, not constant time."
"On the other hand, if you drop the requirement that searches be fast (or you allow the data structure to “cheat” by delaying or deferring its maintenance of the order), then you can certainly have a data structure in which you “insert” a new element in O(1) time and “delete” an element in O(n) time. For example, if you simply maintained a linked list (or even a tree that is not maintained in order) you could add new elements in constant time. But then, if you want to “delete” an element (say, with a given key) you might need to scan through the whole structure (O(n) in the worst case) in order to locate it and then fix up the ordering later."
In summary:
"• If you want a genuine search tree that gives you fast (e.g. O(log n)) search and ordered traversal, then any insertion must take about O(log n) time in the worst-case – you cannot have worst‐case O(1) insertion."
"• If you are allowed to “cheat” (that is, you relax the requirement for efficient search and/or you allow expensive operations later on, such as when deleting) then yes, you can build a structure that admits O(1) insertions and O(n) deletions. (For instance, you might “buffer” new insertions in an unsorted list that you later merge into a search structure when a deletion occurs.)"
"So the answer depends on what you mean by “search tree”. For a properly ordered search tree (one with efficient search), worst‐case O(1) insertion is not achievable."
