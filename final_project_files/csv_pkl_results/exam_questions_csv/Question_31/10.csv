"Question: Is it possible to implement an AVL tree with an additional operation that returns the smallest element greater than or equal to the average of the elements in \( O(1) \) time, without affecting the runtime of other operations?"
"3o-mini: We can certainly augment an AVL tree so that we can compute the total sum and the count of the nodes in O(1) time (by storing and maintaining these as extra fields in each node). Then given that information, we can compute the average (sum/count) in O(1) time. However, finding the smallest element that is greater than or equal to that average is essentially a lower‐bound query in the tree, and in a balanced binary search tree (such as an AVL tree) this operation takes O(log n) time."
"One might then ask whether it is possible to “precompute” or “keep track of” the node that will be returned by such a query. In theory you could maintain an extra pointer to the “current” candidate. But here’s the rub: every time you insert or delete an element the overall sum, count, and thus the average changes. Moreover, even if you somehow maintained this pointer, when the tree is rebalanced (via rotations during insertion or deletion) the candidate pointer may no longer be valid. To update such a pointer correctly, you would very likely have to perform work similar in cost to a typical search (or update many nodes), so you would end up increasing the cost of insertions/deletions beyond O(log n)."
"In short, while you can perform the average computation in O(1) time, the operation of finding the “lower bound” for that average in an AVL tree will take O(log n) time unless you incur extra maintenance cost during inserts/deletions that would affect their asymptotic performance. Therefore, it isn’t possible to add such an operation to an AVL tree that always runs in O(1) time without affecting the runtime of the other operations."
"Short answer: No, you cannot implement it in O(1) time without trade‐offs that would slow down the update operations."
