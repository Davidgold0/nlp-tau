"Question: Is it possible to implement an AVL tree with an additional operation that returns the smallest element greater than or equal to the average of the elements in \( O(1) \) time, without affecting the runtime of other operations?"
"3o-mini: We can certainly augment an AVL tree to support additional operations (for example, by storing subtree sums and counts in each node so that the average can be computed in O(1) time from the root). However, the specific operation “return the smallest element greater than or equal to the average” is more problematic."
One “naïve” approach is to:
1. Augment the tree so that the total sum and count of elements are maintained in the root (or globally); then the average can be computed in O(1) time.
"2. When asked for the smallest element greater than or equal to that average, perform a modified binary search (using subtree information) to find the first element that is ≥ average."
The search in step 2 will generally take O(log n) time.
"One might then wonder if we can “cache” or “precompute” the answer after every update, so that the query itself takes O(1) time. For example, one could try to maintain a pointer (or cached value) to the desired element and update it upon every insertion or deletion."
"The difficulty is that an individual update (insertion or deletion) can change the overall average in a non‐local way. In the worst case, a single update might force a “recomputation” of this candidate pointer that itself could take O(log n) (and in pathological cases even more if one tried to “walk” many nodes to adjust the pointer). Thus, while you pay O(log n) cost in a standard AVL update anyway, if you attempt to update the cached “next-to-average” pointer correctly, you are adding additional work to every update."
"In other words, if you want an O(1) query for this “smallest element greater than or equal to the average” operation, you’d need to do extra work during insertion/deletion to keep the pointer up‐to‐date. In the worst case, that additional bookkeeping could add more than a constant amount of work per update (or—even if it remains O(log n) overall—its constant factors may be affected)."
"So, with an AVL tree the standard operations (insertion, deletion, search) already take O(log n) time and recomputing the needed answer by traversing the tree is also O(log n) in the worst case. There is no known method to “magically” achieve a constant‐time query for the “smallest element greater than or equal to the average” while both:"
" • keeping all other operations at O(log n) time, and"
 • ensuring that the extra update work (to maintain a cached answer) remains strictly constant per operation in the worst‐case.
"Thus, the answer is: No, it is not possible to implement an AVL tree with an additional operation that returns the smallest element greater than or equal to the average in O(1) time—without affecting the runtime (or constant factors) of other operations."
