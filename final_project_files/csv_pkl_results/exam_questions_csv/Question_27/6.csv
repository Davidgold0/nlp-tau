Question: Given an array of $n$ integers between $0$ and $2^n$.
"It is given that each number in the array is a multiple of the upper bound value of $2^N$, divided by $N^3$. Propose an algorithm to sort the array."
"3o-mini: We can take advantage of the extra “structure” in the input. Although the numbers lie between 0 and 2ⁿ (so they appear to be n‑bit integers), each number is known to be an integer multiple of"
  L = (2ⁿ)/(n³).
"In other words, every element x in the array can be written as"
  x = k · L   with  0 ≤ k ≤ n³.
"Thus, while x might be very large (up to 2ⁿ), the “interesting part” of x is really the multiplier k, and that k can only take on at most n³ + 1 different values. In fact, notice that:"
"   • L is very large (by a factor of about 2ⁿ) compared to n³,"
"   • and so although x is represented with n bits, the “effective number of bits” needed to represent k is only about log₂(n³) = 3·log₂ n."
The idea is then to “compress” each number x by computing
  q = x / L = x · (n³/2ⁿ).
"Since every x is a multiple of L, q is an integer in the range [0, n³]. Now instead of sorting the possibly huge numbers x, we can sort the much smaller integers q. There are several ways to do this efficiently:"

Method 1. Radix Sort
───────────────────────────── 
"Since every q has only O(log n) bits (precisely, about 3 log n bits), we can use radix sort with an appropriate base (say, base n or base 2^w for a fixed word size) to sort the n numbers in O(n) time (the number of passes will be O(log n) divided by the number of bits processed per pass, which is constant)."
───────────────────────────── 
Method 2. Bucket (Counting) Sort
───────────────────────────── 
"Alternatively, one may note that the range of possible q’s is 0 to n³, which is polynomial in n. If higher space is allowed we can create an auxiliary array (or “buckets”) of size n³ + 1, count the frequency of each q and then produce the sorted order in O(n + n³) time. (This is linear in the maximum number if n³ is taken as a function of n—but since n³ is a polynomial, one usually views this as “linear in the size of the key‐space”, though it might not be acceptable if you really want a linear-time algorithm in the worst case with respect to n.) "
"A more “space‐efficient” approach is to use bucket sort with n buckets, where each bucket corresponds to an interval of q–values. Since there are only n numbers distributed among n buckets, the expected number of numbers per bucket is constant, and the sorting inside each bucket (say by insertion sort) will be very fast. (Of course, in the worst-case one bucket might hold almost all n numbers so one must be a bit careful if worst-case guarantees are desired. But under reasonable assumptions or using more sophisticated bucketing one can achieve linear time.)"

Outline of a Radix Sort Algorithm
───────────────────────────── 
1. Preprocess each element x in the array:
"  a. Compute q = x · (n³/2ⁿ). (Since x is an integer which is known to be a multiple of (2ⁿ)/(n³), this division is exact.)"
2. Use radix sort (with an appropriate base) on the array of q’s.
"3. Once you have sorted the q’s, the corresponding x’s will be in sorted order."
"4. (Optionally, if you need to output the sorted x’s, you may either store pointers or do a final pass to convert the q’s back (using x = q · L).)"
"Because each integer x has only O(log n) “effective” bits (through q), the radix sort will take O(n) time."
─────────────────────────────
Thus one acceptable answer to the problem is:
"Step 1. For each element in the array, compute q = x · (n³/2ⁿ).  "
Step 2. Use radix sort on these q values (which have only about 3 log n bits).  
Step 3. Output the corresponding elements in sorted order.
This algorithm runs in O(n) time (with the usual assumptions about linear-time radix sort on O(log n)-bit integers) and uses the given structure of the numbers.
"Any method that “compresses” the numbers to their small multipliers (q’s) and then sorts them (whether by radix, bucket, or even counting sort if the space is not a concern) is acceptable."
