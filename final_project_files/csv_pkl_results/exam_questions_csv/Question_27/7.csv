Question: Given an array of $n$ integers between $0$ and $2^n$.
"It is given that each number in the array is a multiple of the upper bound value of $2^N$, divided by $N^3$. Propose an algorithm to sort the array."
"3o-mini: We can exploit the extra structure in the numbers to beat the usual O(n log n) lower bound for comparison‐based sorting. In our case the n numbers are in the range [0, 2ⁿ] but each one is a multiple of"
  T = 2ⁿ⁄n³.
"That is, every number A[i] in our array can be written as"
  A[i] = rᵢ · T      (for some integer rᵢ).
"Notice that since the maximum possible number is 2ⁿ, we have"
  rᵢ ≤ 2ⁿ / T = 2ⁿ ⁄ (2ⁿ/n³) = n³.
"Thus all values rᵢ lie in the range [0, n³] even though the original numbers lie in [0, 2ⁿ]. (Often n³ is much smaller than 2ⁿ.) In other words, although the actual numbers may be huge, their “multiplier” rᵢ is from a relatively small universe (only about n³ distinct possibilities)."
"The idea now is simple: instead of sorting the huge numbers directly, we compute for each number its “multiplier” rᵢ (i.e. rᵢ = A[i]/T) and then sort the array by these numbers. Since rᵢ takes on only integers in [0, n³], we can sort the array using a non‐comparison based sort such as counting sort or radix sort in linear (or near–linear) time."
A high–level description of one acceptable algorithm is as follows:
────────────────────────────────────────
Step 1. Compute the “step size”
  T ← 2ⁿ/n³
"Step 2. For each i from 1 to n, compute the “index”"
  r[i] ← A[i] / T
"    (Notice that since A[i] is a multiple of T, this division is exact.)"
Step 3. Sort the array based on the r[·] values.
"  • Since each r[i] is an integer in [0, n³] and there are only n numbers,"
    you can use counting sort or radix sort.
"  • For instance, if you use radix sort with a base on the order of n (or choose"
"    the number of passes based on logₙ(n³) = 3), then the sorting takes O(n) time."
Step 4. Output the array sorted according to the sorted order of r[i] (which is the same as the numerical order of A[i]).
────────────────────────────────────────
"Because there are only O(n) numbers, and the r[i] values have only O(log (n³)) = O(log n) bits, you can sort in O(n) time using radix sort. (A counting sort approach would be O(n + n³) in the worst case, which may not be acceptable unless n is small relative to n³; however, using radix sort with O(log n) passes yields O(n) time.) "
"Thus, by taking advantage of the fact that each number is a multiple of 2ⁿ/n³, we can “compress” the sorting problem down to one on numbers in {0, 1, 2, …, n³} and then sort in linear time."
────────────────────────────────────────
Summary:
1. Compute T = 2ⁿ/n³.
"2. For each number A[i], compute r[i] = A[i] / T."
3. Sort the n values r[i] using radix sort (or bucket sort) in O(n) time.
4. Use the sorted order to output the sorted array A.

This is one acceptable answer (and algorithm) for the problem.
