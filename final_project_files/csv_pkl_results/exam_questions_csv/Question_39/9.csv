"Question: \textit{We insert into a binomial heap (initially empty) the sequence of numbers 1, 2, \ldots, n in ascending order. For two binomial trees in the heap created, with ranks i, j such that i < j, what is the relation between all the values in the tree of rank i and all the values in the tree of rank j? Explain.}"
"3o-mini: When you insert the numbers 1, 2, …, n in ascending order into a binomial heap, the trees that remain in the heap (one tree for each 1 in the binary expansion of n) have a special property. In particular, if you have two binomial trees in the heap with ranks i and j (and i < j), then every value that appears in the tree of rank i is less than every value that appears in the tree of rank j."
Here’s why this happens:
"1. In a binomial heap, a tree of rank k is built by linking two trees of rank k–1. When two trees of the same rank are combined, the linking procedure makes the root with the smaller value the overall root. Thus, the smaller tree becomes the parent of the other."
"2. Since the elements are inserted in ascending order, the smaller numbers are inserted earlier. As a consequence, when trees are linked during the insertion process, the earlier (and thus smaller) keys tend to become roots and stay higher up in the tree structure."
"3. By the time you have finished inserting all n numbers, the remaining forest is a collection of binomial trees that correspond to the 1’s in the binary representation of n. The tree of lower rank (say, rank i) was formed earlier and its root was chosen because it was smaller than the key from the tree it was linked with. In contrast, the tree of higher rank (rank j with j > i) was either formed later or resulted from linking new trees containing later (and thus larger) numbers."
"4. A more formal way to see it is by induction on the difference in ranks. The process of linking always puts the smaller of the two roots at the top. So if you assume that for trees of rank i the property holds, then when you link two trees of rank i to form a rank (i+1) tree, the new root is smaller than the root of its partner and, by induction, all elements in one of the trees are less than all the elements in the other. This inductively extends to showing that all the numbers in any tree of rank i are less than those in any tree of higher rank j."
"Thus, the answer is:"
"For any two binomial trees in the heap with ranks i and j where i < j, every element in the tree of rank i is smaller than every element in the tree of rank j."
