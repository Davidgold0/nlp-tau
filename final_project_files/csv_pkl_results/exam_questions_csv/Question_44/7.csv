Question: \begin{enumerate}
    \item Given an array containing n elements. The number of distinct elements is k (𝑛 ≤ 𝑘).
    \item Sort the following asymptotic orders without explanation (𝑛 ≤ 𝑘):
    \begin{itemize}
"        \item n \log n,"
"        \item n,"
"        \item n \log k,"
"        \item n + k \log k,"
        \item n^2
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
3o-mini: One acceptable answer was to write the five orders (with n and k related by k ≤ n in a typical setting) as follows:
  O(n)  <  O(n·log k)  ≤  O(n + k·log k)  ≤  O(n·log n)  <  O(n²).
"Note that in the common situation when k = Θ(n) (that is, when almost every element is distinct) we have"
"  n·log k = n·log n and n + k·log k = Θ(n·log n),"
so the three “middle” orders all become Θ(n·log n).
There is no explanation here since only a sorted list was requested.
