"Question: \text{Given an array containing } n \text{ elements. The number of distinct elements is } k \, (k \leq n). \\"
\text{d. Assume the elements are integers between } 1 \text{ and } n^4. \text{ Propose a deterministic algorithm to sort the array.}
"3o-mini: We can use radix sort to obtain a deterministic O(n) sorting algorithm. Since every integer is in the range 1 to n⁴, each number requires at most 4 digits in base n (because n⁴ written in base n has 4 digits). Here’s the idea:"
1. Convert each number into its 4‑digit representation in base n.
"2. Process the digits starting from the least significant digit (LSD) to the most significant digit (MSD). For each digit, use a stable counting sort. (Counting sort works in O(n + b) time where b is the range of the digit values; here b = n, so counting sort runs in O(n) time.)"
"3. Since there are only 4 digits, the overall running time is 4 · O(n) = O(n)."
"This algorithm is completely deterministic and sorts the array in linear time, taking full advantage of the fact that the numbers lie in a restricted range (even though they are huge in value, they have only 4 “digits” in base n)."
