"Question: We construct a hashing table of size \(m\) using the chaining method. The hash function is randomly selected from a universal family of hash functions. \(n\) distinct elements have already been inserted into the table. Now, we perform a search for an element \(x\) that is already in the table. Provide the best possible bound (not asymptotic) on the expected number of elements in the list where \(x\) is located."
Teacher: Let’s work through this problem step by step. Here’s an outline of what we need to do:
1. Restate the scenario in your own words to ensure understanding.
"2. Identify how a universal family of hash functions affects the probability that any other element “collides” with x (i.e., lands in the same slot as x) in the hash table."
3. Calculate the expected number of other elements that will be in the same list or chain as x.
4. Combine the fact that x is already in its slot with the (n – 1) other elements’ expected collisions to get the total expected number of elements in the chain.
"Now, let’s start with step 1:"
How would you restate the problem in your own words to ensure you understand it clearly? Please share your understanding.
"Student: In this problem, we have a hash table of size \(m\) that uses the chaining method for collision resolution. We have already inserted \(n\) distinct elements into this table, and now we want to search for an element \(x\) that is known to be present in the table. Our goal is to determine the expected number of elements in the chain (or list) where \(x\) is located, taking into consideration the properties of a universal family of hash functions that we are using for hashing."
"In simpler terms, I need to find out how many elements, on average, will be in the same ""bucket"" or chain as the element \(x\) when I search for it, considering that there are \(n\) elements already in the table and that the hash function is chosen from a universal family. "
Is that a correct understanding of the problem?
Teacher: Great restatement! Your understanding is correct.
"Now, for step 2, let's look at the universal family of hash functions. Recall that for any two distinct elements, a universal family ensures that the chance of a collision (i.e., both elements hashing to the same slot) is at most 1/m."
"Based on this, what is the probability that any one of the other (n – 1) elements collides with x? Please work through this step and share your reasoning."
"Student: Student: Given that we are using a universal family of hash functions, the probability that any distinct element collides with \(x\) (i.e., hashes to the same slot as \(x\)) is at most \(1/m\)."
"Since there are \(n - 1\) other elements in the hash table, we can calculate the expected number of these elements that collide with \(x\). The expected number of collisions can be found by multiplying the probability of a collision for each of the \(n - 1\) elements by the number of elements:"
\[
\text{Expected number of collisions} = (n - 1) \cdot \frac{1}{m}
\]
This gives us the expected number of elements among the \(n - 1\) that will hash to the same slot as \(x\). 
Is this reasoning correct?
"Teacher: Correct! Your reasoning is spot on. Each of the other (n – 1) elements has a probability of 1/m of colliding with x, so the expected number of collisions is indeed (n – 1)/m."
"Now, for step 3, recall that x is already in its slot. Can you determine the total expected number of elements in the list (chain) where x is located by combining these collisions with x itself? Please work through this step and share your reasoning."
"Student: Student: Sure! Since we have already established that the expected number of other elements that collide with \(x\) is \((n - 1)/m\), we need to add \(1\) to account for the element \(x\) itself, which is already in the chain."
"So, the total expected number of elements in the chain where \(x\) is located would be:"
\[
\text{Total expected number of elements} = 1 + \frac{(n - 1)}{m}
\]
This expression combines the single element \(x\) with the expected number of collisions from the other \(n - 1\) elements.
Is this the correct way to express the total expected number of elements in the chain?
Teacher: Your reasoning in step 3 is exactly right! You correctly added the element x itself to the expected number of collisions calculated from the other (n – 1) elements.
"Now that we have the intermediate steps, what would be your final answer for the expected number of elements in the chain where x is located? Please state your final answer (remember, it’s 1 + (n – 1)/m) and explain briefly why it makes sense."
Student: Student: The final answer for the expected number of elements in the chain where \(x\) is located is:
\[
1 + \frac{(n - 1)}{m}
\]
"This makes sense because we start with the element \(x\) itself, which is always in the chain, contributing \(1\) to the count. Then, we add the expected number of other elements that collide with \(x\), which is given by \((n - 1)/m\). This reflects the average number of other elements that hash to the same slot as \(x\) due to the properties of the universal family of hash functions."
"In summary, this expression captures both the presence of \(x\) and the average behavior of the other elements in the hash table, providing a clear expectation of how many elements we would find in the chain when searching for \(x\)."
"Teacher: Great job working through the problem step by step! You've clearly outlined that with chaining, there's always the element x in its slot and each of the other n – 1 elements collides with x with probability 1/m, so the expected number of elements in the chain is indeed the element x itself plus (n – 1)/m for the collisions."
Your final answer is:
1 + (n - 1)/m$
