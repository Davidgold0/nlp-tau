"Question: We construct a hashing table of size \(m\) using the chaining method. The hash function is randomly selected from a universal family of hash functions. \(n\) distinct elements have already been inserted into the table. Now, we perform a search for an element \(x\) that is already in the table. Provide the best possible bound (not asymptotic) on the expected number of elements in the list where \(x\) is located."
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem together.
Restating the problem in our own words:
We have a hash table of size m where n distinct elements have already been inserted using chaining. A hash function from a universal family is chosen at random. Now we are searching for an element x that is already in the table. What we need to determine is the expected number of elements (the chain length) in the slot where x is stored.
"To approach this, consider the following steps:"
"1. Recognize that x is already in the table, so its chain will include x plus any other element that hashes to the same slot as x."
"2. Because the hash function is chosen from a universal family, each of the remaining (n – 1) elements will hash to the same slot as x with probability 1/m."
3. Use linearity of expectation to sum up the contributions from these (n – 1) elements.
"4. Finally, include x in the count to get the total expected number of elements in x's chain."
"Now, please work on the first step:"
What is the expected number of elements (other than x) that hash to the same slot as x? Please explain your reasoning.
"Student: To find the expected number of elements (other than \(x\)) that hash to the same slot as \(x\), we can follow the reasoning outlined in the teacher's guidance."
"1. **Identifying the elements**: Since \(x\) is already in the table, we are interested in the \(n - 1\) distinct elements that were inserted before \(x\)."
"2. **Probability of hashing to the same slot**: For each of these \(n - 1\) elements, the probability that any particular element hashes to the same slot as \(x\) is \(\frac{1}{m}\) because we are using a hash function from a universal family."
"3. **Calculating the expected number**: We can denote each of the \(n - 1\) elements as \(e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_{n-1}\). For each element \(e_i\), we can define an indicator random variable \(I_i\) that equals 1 if \(e_i\) hashes to the same slot as \(x\) and 0 otherwise. The expected value of \(I_i\) is:"
   \[
   \mathbb{E}[I_i] = \frac{1}{m}
   \]
"4. **Summing up the contributions**: To find the total expected number of elements (other than \(x\)) that hash to the same slot as \(x\), we sum the expected values of the indicator variables for all \(n - 1\) elements:"
   \[
   \mathbb{E}[\text{Number of elements hashing to the same slot as } x] = \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} I_i\right] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \mathbb{E}[I_i] = (n - 1) \cdot \frac{1}{m}
   \]
"So, the expected number of elements (other than \(x\)) that hash to the same slot as \(x\) is \(\frac{n - 1}{m}\)."
"Now, would you like me to proceed to the next step, which is to include \(x\) in the count to find the total expected number of elements in the chain where \(x\) is located?"
Teacher: Great work on the first step! You've correctly determined that the expected number of elements (other than x) that hash to the same slot is (n – 1)/m.
"Now, for the next step, let’s include x itself in the count. Since x is already in the table, how would you add it to your count to obtain the total expected number of elements in its chain? Please explain your reasoning and provide your revised calculation."
"Student: Student: Thank you for your guidance! Now, let’s include \(x\) in our count to find the total expected number of elements in the chain where \(x\) is located."
1. **Including \(x\)**: We have already calculated the expected number of elements (other than \(x\)) that hash to the same slot as \(x\) to be \(\frac{n - 1}{m}\).
"2. **Total expected count**: Since \(x\) is definitely in the chain (as we are searching for it), we need to add 1 to our previous calculation to account for \(x\) itself."
"3. **Revised calculation**: Therefore, the total expected number of elements in the chain where \(x\) is located can be expressed as:"
   \[
   \text{Total expected number of elements in the chain} = \frac{n - 1}{m} + 1
   \]
4. **Simplifying**: We can rewrite this as:
   \[
   \text{Total expected number of elements in the chain} = \frac{n - 1 + m}{m}
   \]
"So, the final expected number of elements in the list where \(x\) is located is \(\frac{n - 1 + m}{m}\)."
Would you like me to summarize everything or clarify any part of the solution?
Teacher: Great work! Your reasoning is correct.
"You correctly computed that the expected number of elements (other than x) in the chain is (n – 1)/m. Then, by including x itself, the total expected number of elements in x’s chain is given by:"
  Total expected number = (n – 1)/m + 1 = (m + n – 1)/m
Final Answer: (m + n – 1)/m$
