"Question: We construct a hashing table of size \(m\) using the chaining method. The hash function is randomly selected from a universal family of hash functions. \(n\) distinct elements have already been inserted into the table. Now, we perform a search for an element \(x\) that is already in the table. Provide the best possible bound (not asymptotic) on the expected number of elements in the list where \(x\) is located."
"Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem into clear steps. The question asks us to find the expected number of elements in the chain containing an element x (which is already in the table) given that n distinct elements have been inserted into a table of size m with chaining, and the hash function is chosen uniformly at random from a universal family."
Here are the steps that we need to follow:
"1. Note that since x is already in the table, the chain where x is located must include x itself."
"2. For each of the other (n – 1) elements, determine the probability that it hashes to the same chain as x. (Remember, with a universal hash family, the probability that any other element collides with x is 1/m.)"
3. Sum these probabilities to determine the expected number of additional elements in x’s chain aside from x.
"4. Finally, add 1 (for x itself) to get the final expected number."
"Now, let’s begin with step 1."
Step 1: Explain why we must count the element x itself as one of the elements in its chain.
What is your reasoning for step 1?
"Student: In step 1, we need to recognize that since we are searching for the element \(x\) and we know that it is already in the hash table, it must be part of the chain where it is located. In hashing with chaining, each slot in the hash table can hold a list (or chain) of elements that hash to the same index. Therefore, when we refer to the chain containing \(x\), it inherently includes \(x\) itself."
"Thus, we must count \(x\) as one of the elements in its chain because the definition of the chain is that it contains all elements that hash to the same index, including the element we are searching for. This establishes a baseline for our expected count, which will be added to as we consider the other elements in the table. "
"So, the reason we count \(x\) itself is that it is guaranteed to be present in the chain, and we need to account for it when calculating the expected total number of elements in that chain. "
Would you like to proceed to step 2?
"Teacher: Great job on step 1! Now, let’s move on to step 2."
"Step 2: For each of the other (n – 1) elements, determine the probability that a given element hashes to the same slot (i.e., chain) as x. "
"Based on that, what is the probability for any one of the remaining elements to belong to x’s chain? Please solve just this part and explain your reasoning."
"Student: In step 2, we need to determine the probability that any one of the remaining \(n - 1\) elements hashes to the same slot as the element \(x\)."
"Since we are using a universal family of hash functions, the probability that any particular element hashes to a specific slot in the hash table is uniformly distributed among the \(m\) slots. This means that for any element, the chance of it colliding with \(x\) (i.e., hashing to the same slot) is \(1/m\)."
"To explain this further, when we insert an element into the hash table, it is assigned to a slot based on the hash function. With \(m\) slots available and the hash function being chosen uniformly at random, each of the \(n\) elements, including \(x\), has an equal probability of \(1/m\) of being placed in any given slot. Thus, for any one of the remaining \(n - 1\) elements, the probability that it will hash to the same slot as \(x\) is also \(1/m\)."
"So, the answer to step 2 is that the probability for any one of the remaining elements to belong to \(x\)’s chain is \(1/m\)."
Would you like to proceed to step 3?
Teacher: Great work on step 2! Now let's move on to step 3.
Step 3: We need to determine the expected number of additional elements (besides x) in its chain. Recall that each of the remaining (n – 1) elements has a probability of 1/m of hashing to the same slot as x. How would you sum up these probabilities to find the expected number of additional elements in x's chain? Please explain your reasoning and show your work for this step.
"Student: Student: In step 3, we want to find the expected number of additional elements in the chain containing \(x\) (aside from \(x\) itself). We have already established that each of the remaining \(n - 1\) elements has a probability of \(1/m\) of hashing to the same slot as \(x\)."
"To find the expected number of additional elements in \(x\)'s chain, we can use the linearity of expectation. We can denote the expected number of additional elements as \(E\)."
"For each of the \(n - 1\) elements, we can define an indicator random variable \(I_i\) for each element \(i\) (where \(i\) ranges from 1 to \(n-1\)) that takes the value:"
"- \(1\) if element \(i\) hashes to the same slot as \(x\) (i.e., it is in the same chain as \(x\)),"
- \(0\) otherwise.
The expected value of \(I_i\) is given by the probability that element \(i\) hashes to the same slot as \(x\):
\[
E[I_i] = P(I_i = 1) = \frac{1}{m}.
\]
"Now, the total expected number of additional elements in \(x\)'s chain, \(E\), can be expressed as the sum of the expected values of these indicator variables:"
\[
E = E[I_1] + E[I_2] + \ldots + E[I_{n-1}].
\]
"Since there are \(n - 1\) such elements, we have:"
\[
E = (n - 1) \cdot \frac{1}{m}.
\]
This gives us the expected number of additional elements in the chain containing \(x\) (aside from \(x\) itself) as \(\frac{n - 1}{m}\).
"So, to summarize, the expected number of additional elements in \(x\)'s chain is \(\frac{n - 1}{m}\)."
Would you like to proceed to step 4?
"Teacher: Great work on step 3! Your explanation is clear and correct. Now, let’s move on to step 4."
"Step 4: We need to account for the fact that the chain already contains x. That means we must add 1 (for x itself) to the expected number of additional elements you calculated, which was (n – 1)/m."
How would you combine these to get the final expected number of elements in the chain where x is located? Please explain your reasoning and show your work for this step.
"Student: In step 4, we need to combine the expected number of additional elements in the chain with the fact that the element \(x\) itself is already included in the chain. "
"From step 3, we determined that the expected number of additional elements in \(x\)'s chain (aside from \(x\)) is given by:"
\[
E[\text{additional elements}] = \frac{n - 1}{m}.
\]
"Now, since \(x\) is definitely in its own chain, we need to add 1 to this expected value to account for \(x\) itself. Thus, the total expected number of elements in the chain containing \(x\) can be expressed as:"
\[
E[\text{total elements in the chain}] = E[\text{additional elements}] + 1.
\]
"Substituting the expression we found for the expected number of additional elements, we have:"
\[
E[\text{total elements in the chain}] = \frac{n - 1}{m} + 1.
\]
"To simplify this expression, we can write it as:"
\[
E[\text{total elements in the chain}] = \frac{n - 1}{m} + \frac{m}{m} = \frac{n - 1 + m}{m}.
\]
"Therefore, the final expected number of elements in the chain where \(x\) is located is:"
\[
E[\text{total elements in the chain}] = \frac{n + m - 1}{m}.
\]
This gives us the best possible bound on the expected number of elements in the list where \(x\) is located. 
Thank you for guiding me through this problem! Would you like to discuss anything else related to this topic?
"Teacher: Excellent work on step 4! You've correctly combined the expected number of additional elements with the element x itself. By adding 1 to (n – 1)/m, you obtained (n – 1 + m)/m, which simplifies to (n + m – 1)/m."
Your final expected number of elements in the chain where x is located is: (n + m – 1)/m$
