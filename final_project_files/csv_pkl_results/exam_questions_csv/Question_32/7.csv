"Question: We construct a hashing table of size \(m\) using the chaining method. The hash function is randomly selected from a universal family of hash functions. \(n\) distinct elements have already been inserted into the table. Now, we perform a search for an element \(x\) that is already in the table. Provide the best possible bound (not asymptotic) on the expected number of elements in the list where \(x\) is located."
"3o-mini: When inserting n distinct elements into a hash table of size m using chaining, and assuming the hash function is chosen from a universal family (so that for any two distinct elements x and y, the probability that they collide is at most 1/m), we can compute the expected number of elements in the chain where an element x is located as follows:"
1. Element x is certainly in its own chain.
"2. For any other element y (with y ≠ x), the probability that y hashes to the same slot as x is at most 1/m."
"Thus, by linearity of expectation, the expected number of other elements that end up in the same chain as x is at most (n – 1)/m."
"Adding x itself, the expected number of elements in x’s chain is:"
  1 + (n – 1)/m.
"This is the best possible (exact, non-asymptotic) bound for the expected number of elements in the chain when performing a search for an element that is known to be in the table."
