"Question: We build a hashing table of size \( m \) using the open addressing method (i.e., all the elements are in the hashing table without using pointers). We use a randomly chosen hash function of the form \( h(k, i) \), where \( k \) is the key that we want to insert into the table, and \( i \) is the probe number. (This is the uniform probing method. The value returned by calling \( h(k, i) \) is a uniformly chosen integer between 2 and \( m-1 \), independent of the previous random selections). The table already contains \( n \) distinct elements. We now perform a search for an element that is not in the table. What is the expected number of table slots examined during the search? Provide as tight a non-asymptotic answer as possible."
"Teacher: Okay, let’s break this problem into manageable steps. We want to find the expected number of probes (table slots examined) when searching for an element that isn’t in the table."
"Step 1: Consider a single probe. Given that there are n elements already in a table of size m, what is the probability that a randomly selected table slot (using our uniformly random probing) is empty? Please compute that probability as your first step."
"Student: To find the probability that a randomly selected table slot is empty, we can start by considering the number of elements already in the table and the total number of slots available."
1. **Total slots in the table**: \( m \)
2. **Number of elements already in the table**: \( n \)
"The number of occupied slots is \( n \). Therefore, the number of empty slots is:"
\[
\text{Number of empty slots} = m - n
\]
"Now, to find the probability that a randomly chosen slot is empty, we can use the following formula:"
\[
\text{Probability (slot is empty)} = \frac{\text{Number of empty slots}}{\text{Total slots}} = \frac{m - n}{m}
\]
"So, the probability that a randomly selected table slot is empty is:"
\[
P(\text{empty slot}) = \frac{m - n}{m}
\]
"Is this calculation correct, Teacher?"
Teacher: That's correct! You've identified that the probability of any given slot being empty is (m – n)/m.
"Now, for Step 2: We want to determine the expected number of probes made until we find an empty slot. We can think of each probe as an independent trial, where each trial has a success probability equal to the probability of landing on an empty slot (which you computed as (m – n)/m). "
Could you now explain how you would model the number of probes needed (hint: consider a well-known probability distribution) and write down the expected number of probes? Please work out this step and share your reasoning.
"Student: To model the number of probes needed to find an empty slot, we can use the concept of a geometric distribution. In this context, each probe can be thought of as an independent Bernoulli trial where we are trying to ""succeed"" by landing on an empty slot."
1. **Success Probability**: The probability of success (finding an empty slot) on each probe is \( P(\text{empty slot}) = \frac{m - n}{m} \).
2. **Geometric Distribution**: The number of trials needed to get the first success in a series of independent Bernoulli trials follows a geometric distribution. The expected value \( E[X] \) for a geometrically distributed random variable \( X \) with success probability \( p \) is given by:
\[
E[X] = \frac{1}{p}
\]
"In our case, the success probability \( p \) is \( \frac{m - n}{m} \). Therefore, we can express the expected number of probes until we find an empty slot as:"
\[
E[\text{number of probes}] = \frac{1}{P(\text{empty slot})} = \frac{1}{\frac{m - n}{m}} = \frac{m}{m - n}
\]
"So, the expected number of table slots examined during the search for an element that is not in the table is:"
\[
\frac{m}{m - n}
\]
"Is this reasoning aligned with your expectations, Teacher?"
"Teacher: Great job! Your reasoning is spot on. You've correctly identified that each probe is an independent trial with a success probability equal to (m – n)/m, and then applied the geometric distribution to conclude that the expected number of probes is 1 divided by that probability, i.e., m/(m – n)."
"To ensure your understanding is complete, can you briefly explain why modeling the process as a geometric distribution makes sense in this context?"
Student: Student: Sure! Modeling the process as a geometric distribution makes sense in this context for a couple of reasons:
1. **Independent Trials**: Each probe we make is independent of the others. The outcome of one probe (whether it lands on an empty slot or not) does not affect the outcome of subsequent probes. This independence is a key characteristic of the geometric distribution.
"2. **Binary Outcomes**: Each probe has two possible outcomes: either we find an empty slot (success) or we do not (failure). This aligns perfectly with the definition of a Bernoulli trial, which is the basis for the geometric distribution."
"3. **Constant Success Probability**: The probability of success (finding an empty slot) remains constant across all probes, as it is determined by the ratio of empty slots to total slots in the table. This constancy is another hallmark of the geometric distribution."
"Overall, because we are interested in the number of trials until the first success occurs, the geometric distribution is the appropriate model to describe the expected number of probes needed to find an empty slot in the hash table. "
"Does that explanation meet your expectations, Teacher?"
"Teacher: Great explanation! You've clearly outlined why each probe is an independent Bernoulli trial with a constant success probability of (m – n)/m, and you applied the geometric distribution properly to find the expected number of probes. This reasoning perfectly justifies that the expected number of table slots examined when searching for a non-existent element is m/(m – n)."
"Now, please state the final answer, followed immediately by a $ with nothing after it."
Student: The expected number of table slots examined during the search for an element that is not in the table is:
\[
\frac{m}{m - n}
\]
$
Teacher: Excellent work! You've carefully reasoned through the problem step by step and correctly derived that the expected number of table slots examined during the search for an element not in the table is m/(m – n)$.
