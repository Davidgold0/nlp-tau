"Question: We build a hashing table of size \( m \) using the open addressing method (i.e., all the elements are in the hashing table without using pointers). We use a randomly chosen hash function of the form \( h(k, i) \), where \( k \) is the key that we want to insert into the table, and \( i \) is the probe number. (This is the uniform probing method. The value returned by calling \( h(k, i) \) is a uniformly chosen integer between 2 and \( m-1 \), independent of the previous random selections). The table already contains \( n \) distinct elements. We now perform a search for an element that is not in the table. What is the expected number of table slots examined during the search? Provide as tight a non-asymptotic answer as possible."
"Teacher: Alright, let’s start by making sure we understand the problem well. We have a hash table of size m that already contains n distinct elements. We’re performing a search for an element that isn’t in the table, and the hash function gives us a uniformly random sequence of slots among the m available (with the twist that it chooses numbers between 2 and m–1, but essentially each probe is independent and uniformly random over the slots). Since the element isn’t in the table, we’ll have to probe until we hit an empty slot. Our final goal is to find the expected number of table slots examined during this search."
"To break this down, here are the general steps we need to follow:"
1. Identify that the table contains n “occupied” slots and (m – n) “empty” slots.
2. Recognize that the probing order is uniformly random; so it’s like we have a random ordering of the m slots.
"3. Realize that the search will probe sequentially until the first empty slot is encountered – essentially, we need the expected position of the first empty slot in a random permutation of the m slots."
4. Derive or use the formula for the expected value of the minimum (first occurrence) among the (m – n) empty slots in the permutation.
5. Work through the calculation to reach an expression that is as tight and non-asymptotic as possible.
Let’s start with step 1:
"Step 1: Can you explain why we can view the table as having n occupied slots and (m – n) empty slots, and how does this relate to the idea of a random ordering of slots? Please share your thoughts on this."
"Student: Sure! In this problem, we have a hash table of size \( m \) that contains \( n \) distinct elements, which means that \( n \) slots are occupied. The remaining slots, \( m - n \), are empty. "
"When we say the probing order is uniformly random, it means that each time we probe for an empty slot, we are equally likely to select any of the \( m \) slots. Since we already know that \( n \) of those slots are occupied, the remaining \( m - n \) slots are empty. "
"This situation can be visualized as having a random permutation of the \( m \) slots, where the positions of the occupied and empty slots are mixed together. When we perform our search for an element that isn't in the table, we will be probing these slots in a random order until we find the first empty slot. "
"Thus, we can think of our search as looking for the first occurrence of an empty slot in this random ordering of \( m \) slots. The key idea here is that the expected position of this first empty slot will help us determine the expected number of slots we need to examine during our search."
Does that make sense? Would you like me to proceed to step 2?
Teacher: Great explanation on step 1!
"Now, let's move to step 2. In this step, we want to relate our problem to finding the expected position of the first empty slot in a random permutation of the m slots. Essentially, we're asking: ""Given a random ordering of m slots (with n occupied and m – n empty), what is the expected position of the first empty slot (i.e., the first occurrence of an empty slot in the permutation)?"" "
"Could you describe how we can set up this idea? Specifically, how does the random permutation model help us calculate the expected number of probes (i.e., the position of the first empty slot)? Please share your thoughts on how to formalize this step."
"Student: Student: Sure! To formalize this step, we can think of the \( m \) slots in the hash table as being arranged in a random permutation. In this permutation, \( n \) slots are occupied by our existing elements, and \( m - n \) slots are empty."
"When we probe for the element that isn't in the table, we are effectively looking for the first empty slot in this random arrangement. The position of the first empty slot can be thought of as a random variable, which we can denote as \( X \). The value of \( X \) represents the number of slots we examine before finding the first empty slot."
"To calculate the expected position of the first empty slot, we can use the concept of indicator random variables. We can define an indicator variable \( I_k \) for each slot \( k \) (from 1 to \( m \)) such that:"
"- \( I_k = 1 \) if the \( k \)-th slot is the first empty slot we encounter,"
- \( I_k = 0 \) otherwise.
The expected value of \( X \) can then be expressed as:
\[
E[X] = \sum_{k=1}^{m} k \cdot P(X = k)
\]
Where \( P(X = k) \) is the probability that the first empty slot appears at position \( k \). 
"Now, for the first empty slot to be at position \( k \), the first \( k-1 \) slots must all be occupied, and the \( k \)-th slot must be empty. The probability of this happening can be determined using combinatorial reasoning. Specifically, we can calculate:"
\[
P(X = k) = \frac{\binom{n}{k-1} \cdot \binom{m-n}{1}}{\binom{m}{k}}
\]
"This represents the number of ways to choose \( k-1 \) occupied slots from \( n \) and 1 empty slot from \( m-n \), divided by the total ways to choose \( k \) slots from \( m \)."
"However, there's a more straightforward approach to find the expected value by recognizing that in a random permutation of \( m \) slots, the expected position of the first occurrence of an empty slot can be derived directly without needing to compute probabilities for each position."
"In a random permutation of \( m \) slots, the expected position of the first empty slot can be shown to be:"
\[
E[X] = \frac{m}{m - n + 1}
\]
"Thus, this formula gives us a direct way to find the expected number of slots examined until we find the first empty slot."
Does this approach make sense? Would you like me to proceed to step 3 and calculate the expected number of probes using this formula?
Teacher: Great work outlining step 2! I see you’ve described the idea of modeling the probe sequence as a random permutation of m slots and pointed out that we are looking for the position of the first empty slot. Your approach using indicator variables and combinatorial reasoning is on track.
"Before moving on to the next step, let’s reflect a bit on your formulation. You wrote that"
"  P(X = k) = [C(n, k–1) · C(m – n, 1)] / C(m, k)."
"That’s a reasonable starting idea, but there’s an alternative and perhaps more straightforward method using order statistics."
"Remember that if we select (m – n) empty slots’ positions uniformly at random from {1, 2, …, m}, then the expected position (or rank) of the smallest (i.e., first) empty slot is given by the formula"
  E[min] = (m + 1) / ((m – n) + 1).
"This comes from known results on order statistics for uniformly chosen samples without replacement. Notice that your tentative final expression was m/(m – n + 1), which is close but missing the “+1” in the numerator."
Let’s now move to step 3:
"Step 3: Using the order statistics perspective for the positions of the (m – n) empty slots, explain why the expected position of the first empty slot is (m + 1)/(m – n + 1). Can you outline the reasoning behind this formula? Please provide your reasoning for this step."
"Student: Student: Absolutely! To understand why the expected position of the first empty slot is given by the formula \( E[\text{min}] = \frac{m + 1}{(m - n) + 1} \), we can look at it through the lens of order statistics."
"When we have \( m \) slots in total, and \( n \) of them are occupied, this means there are \( m - n \) empty slots. If we were to randomly select \( m - n \) positions for these empty slots from the total \( m \) slots, we can think of this as a sampling without replacement."
"Now, if we denote the positions of the \( m - n \) empty slots as a set of uniformly chosen random variables from the set \( \{1, 2, \ldots, m\} \), these positions will have a certain order. The first empty slot we encounter during our probing corresponds to the minimum of these positions."
"The expected value of the minimum of \( k \) uniformly chosen random variables from a set of size \( N \) can be derived from the properties of order statistics. Specifically, the expected value of the minimum of \( k \) uniformly chosen variables from \( \{1, 2, \ldots, N\} \) is given by:"
\[
E[\text{min}] = \frac{N + 1}{k + 1}
\]
In our case:
"- \( N = m \) (the total number of slots),"
- \( k = m - n \) (the number of empty slots).
Substituting these values into our formula gives:
\[
E[\text{min}] = \frac{m + 1}{(m - n) + 1}
\]
"This formula reflects the average position of the first empty slot when we randomly order the slots, taking into account that there are \( m - n \) empty slots among \( m \) total slots."
"So, in summary, the reasoning is based on the properties of order statistics for uniformly sampled positions. This approach simplifies our calculation and leads us directly to the expected position of the first empty slot, which is what we need to find the expected number of table slots examined during the search."
Does this reasoning align with your understanding? Would you like me to proceed to step 4 and calculate the expected number of probes using this formula?
"Teacher: Excellent explanation! Your reasoning for step 3 is spot-on. You clearly illustrated that when we have (m – n) empty slots uniformly distributed among m positions, the expected position of the first empty slot is given by (m + 1)/(m – n + 1) from the order statistics of the minimum."
"Now, let’s move to step 4:"
"Step 4: Using the result E[min] = (m + 1)/(m – n + 1), explain how this result directly tells us the expected number of table slots examined during the search for a key that isn’t in the table. What does this expected position represent in the context of the probing process, and how does it relate to the number of probes? "
Please share your thoughts on how you interpret this formula in terms of probes examined.
Student: Student: Sure! The result \( E[\text{min}] = \frac{m + 1}{m - n + 1} \) directly tells us the expected number of table slots examined during our search for a key that isn't in the table because it represents the expected position of the first empty slot we encounter in our probing process.
"In the context of our search, when we start probing the hash table for a key that is not present, we will examine the slots in a random order until we find an empty slot. The expected position given by our formula indicates how many slots we will typically examine before we encounter the first empty slot."
To break it down:
"- The numerator \( m + 1 \) accounts for the total number of slots plus one, which adjusts our expectation to account for the distribution of empty slots."
"- The denominator \( m - n + 1 \) reflects the number of empty slots plus one, which normalizes our expectation based on how many empty slots are available."
"Thus, the expected number of probes we will perform, or the expected number of slots examined, is directly given by this formula. It tells us that, on average, we will need to check approximately \( \frac{m + 1}{m - n + 1} \) slots before we find an empty one."
"This expected value is important because it provides insight into the efficiency of our search process in the hash table. If \( n \) is much smaller than \( m \), then \( m - n \) (the number of empty slots) is large, and the expected number of probes will be relatively low. Conversely, if \( n \) approaches \( m \), the number of empty slots decreases, resulting in a higher expected number of probes needed to find an empty slot."
"In summary, the expected position of the first empty slot directly translates to the expected number of slots we will examine during our search. It gives us a clear understanding of the probing process's efficiency based on the ratio of occupied to empty slots in the hash table."
Does this interpretation align with what you were expecting? Would you like me to summarize our findings or clarify anything further?
"Teacher: Great job on step 4! You clearly explained that the expected position of the first empty slot—given by (m + 1)/(m – n + 1)—directly corresponds to the expected number of probes we perform in the search process. Each probe checks one slot, so that value tells us how many slots (on average) we examine before finding an empty one."
"Before we wrap up our discussion, could you now provide your final answer based on our discussion? Remember, your final answer should be the expected number of slots examined during the search. Please respond with your final answer only."
Student: The expected number of table slots examined during the search for an element that is not in the table is given by:
\[
\frac{m + 1}{m - n + 1}
\]
Teacher: Great work! You've successfully walked through the problem step by step and carefully explained your reasoning.
"Your final answer for the expected number of table slots examined, when searching for an element not in the table, is: "
(m + 1)/(m − n + 1)$
