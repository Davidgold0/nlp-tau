"Question: The deterministic ""select"" algorithm, which we studied in class, works as follows:"
a. The array is divided into groups of size 5
b. Sort each group
c. Choose a pivot as the median of the medians (recursively)
"d. Perform ""partition"" with the chosen pivot"
e. Recursively apply the algorithm on the relevant part.
"Assume that instead of groups of size 5, we take groups of size 3. "
"In this question, we will deal with the running time of the new algorithm with groups of size 3."
What is the cost of step b? 
Cost:
Explanation:
"3o-mini: Step b involves sorting each group of three numbers. Since each group is of constant size (3), sorting a single group takes constant time—specifically, it takes O(1) comparisons and operations. There are approximately n/3 groups in an array of size n. Multiplying these together, the total cost of step b is O(n/3), which simplifies to O(n). "
Explanation:  
- There are about n/3 groups because the array is divided into groups of 3.  
- Sorting a single group takes constant time since the group has just 3 elements.  
"- Therefore, the overall cost is (n/3) × O(1) = O(n)."
