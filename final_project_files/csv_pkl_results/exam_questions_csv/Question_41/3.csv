"Question: The deterministic ""select"" algorithm, which we studied in class, works as follows:"
a. The array is divided into groups of size 5
b. Sort each group
c. Choose a pivot as the median of the medians (recursively)
"d. Perform ""partition"" with the chosen pivot"
e. Recursively apply the algorithm on the relevant part.
"Assume that instead of groups of size 5, we take groups of size 3. "
"In this question, we will deal with the running time of the new algorithm with groups of size 3."
What is the cost of step b? 
Cost:
Explanation:
Teacher: Let's break down the problem:
We need to find the running time for step (b) when grouping the array into groups of 3 instead of 5. This step involves sorting each group.
"Step 1: Consider one group of 3 elements. Ask yourself, what is the cost (or running time) for sorting such a small, fixed-size group? (Hint: Think about how many elements there are and what the maximum comparisons might be.)"
Step 2: Determine how many groups there are in an array of n elements when using groups of 3.
Step 3: Calculate the total cost by multiplying the cost for one group with the number of groups.
Please solve for the cost of sorting a single group of 3 elements first. How would you describe that cost?
"Student: To find the cost of sorting a single group of 3 elements, we can analyze the sorting process:"
**Step 1: Cost of Sorting One Group of 3 Elements**
"When sorting a group of 3 elements, we can use a simple sorting algorithm like selection sort or insertion sort. The maximum number of comparisons needed to sort 3 elements is:"
"- For 3 elements, we can compare the first element with the second and third (2 comparisons)."
- Then we need to compare the second element with the third (1 comparison).
"In total, this results in a maximum of 3 comparisons. However, since we are dealing with a fixed size of 3, we can say that sorting this group takes constant time. Therefore, we can denote the cost to sort one group of 3 elements as \( O(1) \)."
**Step 2: Number of Groups in an Array of n Elements**
"Next, we need to determine how many groups of size 3 there are in an array of \( n \) elements. We can calculate this by dividing \( n \) by 3. "
The number of groups is given by:
\[
\text{Number of groups} = \lceil \frac{n}{3} \rceil
\]
"For simplicity in analysis, we can approximate this as \( \frac{n}{3} \)."
**Step 3: Total Cost of Sorting All Groups**
"Now, we can calculate the total cost of sorting all the groups. Since sorting each group costs \( O(1) \) and there are approximately \( \frac{n}{3} \) groups, the total cost for step (b) is:"
\[
\text{Total cost} = O(1) \times \lceil \frac{n}{3} \rceil = O\left(\frac{n}{3}\right) = O(n)
\]
**Final Summary:**
- **Cost of sorting one group of 3 elements:** \( O(1) \)
- **Number of groups in an array of n elements:** \( \lceil \frac{n}{3} \rceil \)
- **Total cost for step (b):** \( O(n) \)
"So, the cost of step (b) is \( O(n) \)."
Teacher: Great job working through the first step and the subsequent reasoning! Let’s review what you did:
1. You determined that sorting one group of 3 elements takes constant time (O(1)) because—even though a few comparisons are made—the number of elements is fixed.
"2. You then reasoned that the number of groups in an array of n elements is approximately n/3, so the total cost for sorting all groups is roughly O(1) per group multiplied by about n/3 groups, which simplifies to O(n)."
"Before we move on, I have a couple of guiding questions for you:"
• Can you explain why the constant factors (like the division by 3) are dropped in Big-O notation and why that still leads to an overall O(n) cost?
"Once you clarify this reasoning, please provide a final summary for the cost of step (b)."
Student: Student: Thank you for your feedback! I’d be happy to clarify why we drop constant factors in Big-O notation.
"In Big-O notation, we focus on the growth rate of a function as the input size \( n \) becomes very large. The constant factors and lower-order terms become less significant compared to the highest-order term. Therefore, when we express the complexity in Big-O notation, we simplify the expression by ignoring constants and lower-order terms because they do not affect the overall growth rate as \( n \) increases."
"For example, when we calculated the total cost for step (b) as \( O\left(\frac{n}{3}\right) \), we recognize that the division by 3 is a constant factor. In Big-O notation, we drop this constant, leading us to express the total cost as \( O(n) \). This indicates that the running time grows linearly with the size of the input, regardless of the constant factor."
**Final Summary for the Cost of Step (b):**
- **Cost of sorting one group of 3 elements:** \( O(1) \)
- **Number of groups in an array of \( n \) elements:** Approximately \( \lceil \frac{n}{3} \rceil \)
- **Total cost for step (b):** \( O(n) \)
"Thus, the overall cost of step (b) is \( O(n) \)."
Teacher: Excellent work! You've clearly explained why the constant factors (like the division by 3) are dropped in Big-O notation and summarized the reasoning well.
To summarize:
• Sorting one group of 3 elements is O(1) since it involves a constant number of comparisons.
"• There are about n/3 groups, which gives a total cost of O(n/3)."
• Dropping the constant factor yields an overall cost of O(n).
Your final summary and explanation are correct.
O(n)$
