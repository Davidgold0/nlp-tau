"Question: The deterministic ""select"" algorithm, which we studied in class, works as follows:"
a. The array is divided into groups of size 5
b. Sort each group
c. Choose a pivot as the median of the medians (recursively)
"d. Perform ""partition"" with the chosen pivot"
e. Recursively apply the algorithm on the relevant part.
"Assume that instead of groups of size 5, we take groups of size 3. "
"In this question, we will deal with the running time of the new algorithm with groups of size 3."
What is the cost of step b? 
Cost:
Explanation:
"Teacher: Let's begin by breaking down the problem. The question asks us to analyze the cost of step b, which is: “Sort each group” when the groups are of size 3 (instead of size 5 as in the original algorithm)."
"To guide you, here’s an outline of the steps we need to think through:"
1. Determine how many groups of 3 are formed from an array of n elements.
2. Determine the cost (in terms of time complexity or number of operations) to sort a single group that consists of 3 elements.
3. Combine the above results to find the total cost for step b across all groups.
Let’s focus on the first step: How many groups of 3 do you think are formed when we divide an array of n elements into groups of 3? Please provide your reasoning for this step.
"Student: To determine how many groups of 3 are formed from an array of n elements, we can divide n by 3. "
"If n is divisible by 3, we will have \( \frac{n}{3} \) groups. If n is not perfectly divisible by 3, we will still form \( \lfloor \frac{n}{3} \rfloor \) groups, and there will be some remaining elements (either 1 or 2) that do not form a complete group. "
"In either case, we can express the number of groups as:"
\[
\text{Number of groups} = \left\lceil \frac{n}{3} \right\rceil
\]
This accounts for any leftover elements by rounding up to the nearest whole number. 
"So, for an array of n elements, we would form approximately \( \frac{n}{3} \) groups of 3, plus possibly one additional group if there are leftover elements. "
"Does this reasoning make sense, teacher?"
"Teacher: Your reasoning is solid! Dividing n elements into groups of 3 indeed gives about ⌈n/3⌉ groups. Now, let’s move to the next step. "
"We need to determine the cost to sort a single group of 3. What do you think is the running time (or cost) to sort 3 elements, and why? Please explain your reasoning for this step."
"Student: Student: To sort a single group of 3 elements, we can use a simple sorting algorithm, such as insertion sort or selection sort. The time complexity for sorting a small number of elements like this is manageable."
"For sorting 3 elements, the maximum number of comparisons needed is limited. Specifically, the number of ways to arrange 3 elements is 3! (which equals 6). However, in practical terms, we can sort them with just a few comparisons."
"In big-O notation, sorting a constant number of elements, such as 3, has a time complexity of \( O(1) \) because it does not grow with n; it remains constant regardless of the size of the input array. "
"Therefore, the cost to sort a single group of 3 elements is \( O(1) \). "
"Does this make sense, teacher?"
Teacher: You've explained the first two steps very well. Now it's time to combine them.
"Recall from step 1 that we have about ⌈n/3⌉ groups, and from step 2 that sorting each group of 3 elements takes constant time, O(1)."
Take a moment to calculate: How would you combine these results to express the total cost for step b in terms of n? Please share your reasoning for this step.
"Student: Student: To find the total cost for step b, we need to combine the number of groups we have with the cost to sort each group."
"From step 1, we determined that there are approximately \( \left\lceil \frac{n}{3} \right\rceil \) groups of 3 elements. "
"From step 2, we established that the cost to sort each group of 3 elements is \( O(1) \)."
"Now, to find the total cost for sorting all the groups, we multiply the number of groups by the cost to sort each group:"
\[
\text{Total cost} = \left\lceil \frac{n}{3} \right\rceil \times O(1)
\]
"Since \( O(1) \) is constant, we can simplify this to:"
\[
\text{Total cost} = O\left(\left\lceil \frac{n}{3} \right\rceil\right)
\]
"In big-O notation, we can further approximate this as:"
\[
O\left(\frac{n}{3}\right) = O(n)
\]
"Thus, the total cost for step b, sorting each group of size 3, is \( O(n) \)."
"Does this reasoning and conclusion align with your expectations, teacher?"
"Teacher: Great job! Your reasoning is correct. You identified that there are roughly ⌈n/3⌉ groups, and since sorting each fixed-size group (of 3 elements) takes constant time O(1), when you multiply these together, you indeed get a total cost of O(n) for step b. "
To summarize our process:
1. We divided the n elements into ⌈n/3⌉ groups.
2. We recognized that sorting each group of 3 takes O(1) time.
"3. Multiplying these together, we obtain O(⌈n/3⌉) = O(n)."
Your conclusion that the cost for step b is O(n) is spot on.
O(n)$
