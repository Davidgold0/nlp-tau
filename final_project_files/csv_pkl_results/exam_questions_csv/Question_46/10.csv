"Question: \textit{Given a series of n elements, what is the time complexity for finding the k smallest elements in the series (for k < n).}"
3o-mini: One common efficient method is to use a max‐heap (or priority queue) of size k. The algorithm works as follows:
1. Insert the first k elements of the series into a max‐heap. This takes O(k) time.
"2. For each of the remaining n − k elements, compare the element with the maximum element in the heap (i.e. the root):"
"   • If the new element is smaller than the heap’s maximum, remove the maximum and insert the new element. Each such operation takes O(log k) time."
"   • Otherwise, do nothing."
"3. At the end, the heap contains the k smallest elements (though they are not in sorted order)."
"Since each of the n − k comparisons may involve an O(log k) adjustment, the total time spent in this step is O((n − k) log k), which is O(n log k) in the worst case."
"Thus, the overall time complexity is:"
  O(k) + O((n − k) log k) = O(n log k)
"If you need the k smallest elements in sorted order, you can sort the heap at the end in O(k log k) time; the overall complexity remains O(n log k) (assuming k < n)."
"Another alternative is to use a selection algorithm (like Quickselect) to find the kth smallest element in expected O(n) time, partition the array around this pivot, and then sort the k smallest elements in O(k log k) time. This approach gives an expected time complexity of O(n + k log k), which is also efficient when k is much smaller than n."
"In summary, for finding the k smallest elements in an n-element series (with k < n), an efficient approach achieves a time complexity of O(n log k)."
