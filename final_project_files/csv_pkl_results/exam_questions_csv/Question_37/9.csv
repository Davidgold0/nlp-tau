"Question: Given \(n\) segments on the line (i.e., the input is \(n\) pairs \((x, y)\) of start and end points), a segment is called ""central"" if there are at least \(n/4\) segments starting before it (its start point is to the left of its start point) and at least \(n/4\) segments ending after it (its end point is to the right of its end point). Propose an algorithm that returns the number of central segments, with the best possible Worst Case running time, and analyze its running time."
3o-mini: We can solve the problem in O(n) worst‐case time using order‐statistics (selection) algorithms. Here’s one way to think about it.
"Suppose you have n segments, each given as a pair (x, y) where x is the start and y is the end of the segment. A segment is “central” if:"
" (1) There are at least n/4 segments that start to its left. (That is, its x value is greater than or equal to the (n/4 + 1)–th smallest x.)"
" (2) There are at least n/4 segments that end to its right. (Equivalently, its y value is less than or equal to the (n/4 + 1)–th largest y. In terms of sorting y in increasing order, this is the same as saying the segment’s y is at most the (3n/4)–th smallest y.)"
"One straightforward approach would be to sort the segments by their start values and by their end values. However, sorting takes O(n log n) time. We can do better by “selecting” the appropriate thresholds using linear–time selection."
Step 1. Find the start threshold.
 • Use a linear–time selection algorithm (such as the median-of-medians algorithm) to find the (n/4 + 1)–th smallest start value. Call this value X_threshold.
 • A segment must have x ≥ X_threshold to ensure that there are at least n/4 segments before it that start further to the left.
Step 2. Find the end threshold.
" • We want at least n/4 segments to end after the segment. When the segments are sorted by end value in increasing order, a segment’s “ending after” count is n minus its rank plus one. So to have at least n/4 segments after it, its rank must be at most 3n/4."
 • Use the linear–time selection algorithm to find the (3n/4)–th smallest y value. Call this value Y_threshold.
 • A segment must have y ≤ Y_threshold to have at least n/4 segments ending after it.
Step 3. Count central segments.
" • Scan through all n segments. For each segment (x, y), if x ≥ X_threshold and y ≤ Y_threshold, then the segment is central."
 • Count these segments.
Analysis of Running Time:
 • Finding X_threshold takes O(n) worst–case time.
" • Similarly, finding Y_threshold takes O(n) worst–case time."
 • Scanning the segments once takes another O(n) time.
" • Thus, the overall worst–case running time is O(n)."
Note:
"• Although one might first think to perform two sorts (one by start and one by end), leading to O(n log n) time, using selection algorithms lets us achieve the optimal linear time."
"• With careful implementation, even subtle ties (if present) can be handled by defining a consistent tie–breaking rule."
"In summary, an optimal worst–case algorithm is to use two linear–time selection steps to obtain the thresholds and a single O(n) pass to count, giving an overall O(n) worst–case running time."
