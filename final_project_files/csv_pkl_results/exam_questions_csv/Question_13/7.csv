"Question: Given a min-heap, with no duplicate keys."
"Each node \( x \) has an additional field \( s \), which is initialized to \( \text{nil} \). We want the field \( s \) of each node \( x \) to contain a pointer to the successor of \( x \). Assume that access to the heap elements is available (i.e., the heap is not a black box). The heap structure itself should not be changed. Propose an algorithm that achieves this, with the best possible overall worst-case time complexity, given that the keys are integers in the range from 1 to \( 2n \)."
"3o-mini: We can take advantage of the fact that the keys are integers in the range 1 to 2n to “bucket‐sort” the nodes without changing the heap structure. The idea is to use an auxiliary array of size 2n (or 2n + 1 if you wish to index from 1) to directly place each node at index equal to its key. Then, a linear scan over this array in increasing order will give the nodes in sorted order, allowing you to set each node’s successor pointer."
Here is the algorithm in more detail:
1. Allocate an auxiliary array A[1..2n] and initialize every entry to nil.
"2. Traverse the heap (using any tree traversal method that visits every node – note that the heap is given in memory, so you can simply go through all n nodes). For each node x with key k, set A[k] = x."
"3. Now, perform a scan of the array A from index 1 to 2n. Let a variable prev initially be nil. For each index i from 1 to 2n:"
"   • If A[i] ≠ nil (i.e. if there is a node with key i),"
"   • Then, if prev is not nil, set prev.s to A[i] (this makes the node pointed by prev point to the current node as its successor)."
   • Then update prev to A[i].
"Note that the very first node encountered (with the smallest key) will not have a predecessor, but that’s fine since the problem only asks for each node’s successor pointer."
Time Complexity Analysis:
• The traversal of the heap takes O(n) time.
• The scan of the auxiliary array takes O(2n) = O(n) time.
"Thus, the overall worst-case time complexity is O(n)."
This is the best possible complexity given that we must process each of the n nodes at least once and that the keys lie in a range that is only a constant factor larger than n.
This algorithm meets the requirement: it sets the s field of each node to point to its successor in sorted order without modifying the heap structure.
