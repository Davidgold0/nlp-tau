"Question: We build a hashing table of size \( m \) using the linear probing method. The keys of the elements inserted into the table are taken from the set \( \{0, 1, \dots, 2m-1\} \). We use the following hash function:"
\[
h(k) = \left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor.
\]
"We insert the elements \( 1, 2, \dots, m \) into the table in increasing order. How much time does it take to insert all the elements into the table using the standard insertion algorithm? Provide an asymptotic bound."
"Teacher: Let's break down the problem into manageable steps. We are asked to analyze the time to insert elements into a hash table of size m using linear probing, where the keys are chosen from {0, 1, …, 2m – 1} and the hash function is h(k) = floor(k/2). The keys 1, 2, …, m are inserted in increasing order."
Here are the steps we can follow:
1. Rephrase the setup: Explain how the hash function maps keys to positions in the table and what this means in terms of collisions when keys are inserted in order.
2. Analyze the patterns: Consider how many keys are mapped to the same initial hash positions and anticipate how many collisions (and therefore probes) occur because of the linear probing.
3. Sum the cost: Look at the cost of inserting each key and then combine these costs to get the total time.
"4. Determine the asymptotic bound: Express the total time using asymptotic notation (big-O, Theta, etc.)."
"Let’s start with the first step. Based on the hash function h(k) = ⌊k/2⌋, describe what the initial hash position will be for a generic key k (for k = 1, 2, …, m) and what that might imply about the “load” of each initial slot. Could you explain that and share your thoughts on how the keys are distributed in the table initially?"
"Student: Sure! The hash function given is \( h(k) = \left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor \). This means that when we insert keys \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, m \), we can determine their initial hash positions as follows:"
- For \( k = 1 \): \( h(1) = \left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor = 0 \)
- For \( k = 2 \): \( h(2) = \left\lfloor \frac{2}{2} \right\rfloor = 1 \)
- For \( k = 3 \): \( h(3) = \left\lfloor \frac{3}{2} \right\rfloor = 1 \)
- For \( k = 4 \): \( h(4) = \left\lfloor \frac{4}{2} \right\rfloor = 2 \)
- For \( k = 5 \): \( h(5) = \left\lfloor \frac{5}{2} \right\rfloor = 2 \)
- For \( k = 6 \): \( h(6) = \left\lfloor \frac{6}{2} \right\rfloor = 3 \)
- For \( k = 7 \): \( h(7) = \left\lfloor \frac{7}{2} \right\rfloor = 3 \)
- For \( k = 8 \): \( h(8) = \left\lfloor \frac{8}{2} \right\rfloor = 4 \)
"From this pattern, we can see that:"
"- The keys \( 1 \) and \( 2 \) map to position \( 0 \) and \( 1 \) respectively, with no collisions."
"- Keys \( 3 \) and \( 4 \) both map to position \( 1 \), causing a collision."
"- Keys \( 5 \) and \( 6 \) both map to position \( 2 \), causing another collision."
"- Keys \( 7 \) and \( 8 \) both map to position \( 3 \), causing yet another collision."
"In general, every two consecutive keys \( k \) and \( k+1 \) (where \( k \) is odd) will hash to the same position \( \left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor \). This means that for every pair of keys, we will have a collision."
"Thus, for \( m \) keys, we can observe that:"
"- The positions \( 0, 1, \ldots, \left\lfloor \frac{m-1}{2} \right\rfloor \) will each have at least one collision for every pair of keys."
"- As a result, the load of each initial slot will be at least \( \lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil \)."
"This initial distribution implies that we will have \( m \) keys, but only \( m/2 \) unique hash slots, leading to a significant number of collisions, which will increase the number of probes needed to insert each key."
"Now, would you like me to move on to analyze the patterns of collisions and how many probes will be needed for each insertion?"
"Teacher: Great job on that explanation of the initial mapping! Now, let's move to the next step: analyzing the pattern of collisions and the number of probes required."
"For each initial hash slot that receives two keys (since for every odd k, k and k+1 map to the same slot), we know that the first key will be inserted directly at its hash position, while the second key will encounter a collision and will have to probe to find the next available slot."
Could you analyze and explain how many probes are needed for each pair of keys that map to the same slot? Try to describe the process for the first key in a slot and then what happens when you insert the second key in that same slot.
Student: Sure! Let's analyze the probing process for keys that hash to the same slot due to collisions.
"When we insert the first key \( k \) into the hash table, it goes directly to its hashed position without any issues. For example, if we insert key \( 1 \) (which hashes to position \( 0 \)), it will be placed there without any probing."
"Now, let's consider the second key \( k+1 \) that hashes to the same slot. Since \( k \) is odd, \( k+1 \) will hash to the same position as \( k \). For instance, if we take \( k = 3 \) (which hashes to position \( 1 \)), when we try to insert \( k+1 = 4 \), it will also hash to position \( 1 \). "
Here's what happens step-by-step:
1. **Insert Key \( k \)**:
"   - The first key, say \( k = 3 \), is inserted at position \( 1 \) with \( 1 \) probe (the initial attempt)."
2. **Insert Key \( k+1 \)**:
"   - The second key, \( k+1 = 4 \), attempts to go to position \( 1 \) but finds it occupied."
"   - It then probes to the next position, which is \( 2 \). Since this position is also occupied by key \( 5 \) (which hashes to \( 2 \)), it continues probing to position \( 3 \)."
"   - Finally, it finds position \( 3 \) empty and successfully inserts key \( 4 \) there."
"In general, the insertion process for any pair of keys that hash to the same slot will look like this:"
- The first key requires \( 1 \) probe to insert.
- The second key will require additional probes to find the next available slot. 
"For every pair of keys \( (k, k+1) \) that collide, the second key will typically require \( 1 + p \) probes, where \( p \) is the number of positions it needs to check until it finds an empty slot. "
"For keys \( 3 \) and \( 4 \) that hash to position \( 1 \), the first insertion takes \( 1 \) probe, and the second insertion takes \( 3 \) probes (1 for the occupied position plus 2 more to find the next empty slot)."
"Now, if we continue this for all \( m \) keys, we can observe that:"
- The first \( m/2 \) keys will each take \( 1 \) probe.
- The next \( m/2 \) keys (the second key in each pair) will take an average of \( 2 \) probes each (since they will typically probe one occupied slot before finding an empty one).
"Thus, the total number of probes for inserting all \( m \) keys can be summarized as:"
\[
\text{Total Probes} = \left( \frac{m}{2} \cdot 1 \right) + \left( \frac{m}{2} \cdot 2 \right) = \frac{m}{2} + m = \frac{3m}{2}.
\]
"Now, would you like me to move on to the final step of summing the costs and determining the asymptotic bound for the total insertion time?"
"Teacher: Okay, great work so far! We've seen that each pair of keys hashing to the same slot causes additional probes beyond the first insertion. The next step is to sum up all the probing costs for all m insertions and then to determine the asymptotic bound for the total insertion time."
To guide you through this final step:
1. Think about what happens as you insert your keys in order. Notice that the later keys tend to have longer probe sequences because earlier insertions create a contiguous block of filled slots.
"2. Try to identify a pattern or formula for the number of probes needed as you insert key i (or for each pair of keys). For example, how does the probe count increase as you move to later keys?"
"3. Once you have a formula or a summation for the total number of probes over m insertions, simplify that summation to express it in asymptotic terms (using big-O or Theta notation)."
"Can you now try to derive the total probe count (or total insertion cost) over all m insertions and then provide the asymptotic bound? Please focus on this step, and let me know your reasoning and calculations."
Student: Sure! Let's derive the total insertion cost over all \( m \) insertions and find the asymptotic bound.
"We already established that for the first \( m/2 \) keys, each key takes \( 1 \) probe to insert. For the second key in each pair (the keys that collide), we found that they generally take about \( 2 \) probes on average."
"Now, let's summarize the insertion costs:"
"1. **For the first \( m/2 \) keys** (keys \( 1, 2, \ldots, m/2 \)):"
   - Each key requires \( 1 \) probe.
   - Total probes for these keys: 
   \[
   \frac{m}{2} \cdot 1 = \frac{m}{2}.
   \]
"2. **For the second \( m/2 \) keys** (keys \( m/2 + 1, m/2 + 2, \ldots, m \)):"
"   - Each of these keys requires, on average, \( 2 \) probes."
   - Total probes for these keys:
   \[
   \frac{m}{2} \cdot 2 = m.
   \]
"Now, let's sum the total number of probes:"
\[
\text{Total Probes} = \frac{m}{2} + m = \frac{3m}{2}.
\]
"Next, we need to consider the asymptotic behavior of the total insertion time. As \( m \) grows large, the dominant term in our total probe count will be \( m \). Thus, we can express the total insertion time in asymptotic notation as:"
\[
O(m).
\]
"In conclusion, the total time to insert all \( m \) elements into the hash table using linear probing, given the specified hash function and the linear probing method, is \( O(m) \). "
Would you like to explore any further details or clarify any part of this analysis?
"Teacher: Let's review your reasoning so far. You correctly noted that the first key in a slot might go in with one probe, and the second key has to search for the next available slot. However, when we insert the keys in increasing order, the probe costs tend to increase as the table fills because each new insertion may have to skip not only one but several occupied entries."
"Before we sum the cost, let's reconsider the process carefully using a small example. For instance, suppose m = 8. The keys 1, 2, …, 8 are inserted in order, and the hash function is h(k) = ⌊k/2⌋. (It might help to simulate a few steps on paper.)  "
"When you simulate, you learn that the costs come out like this:  "
• Key 1: target position 0 → 1 probe  
• Key 2: target position 1 → 1 probe  
• Key 3: target position 1 (occupied) → next free position → 2 probes  
• Key 4: target position 2 (occupied after key 3) → next free → 2 probes  
• Key 5: target position 2 (occupied) → must probe further → 3 probes  
• Key 6: target position 3 (occupied) → 3 probes  
• Key 7: target position 3 (occupied) → 4 probes  
• Key 8: target position 4 (occupied) → 4 probes  
Notice the pattern:  
"The first pair took 1 + 1 probes, the second pair took 2 + 2 probes, the third pair took 3 + 3 probes, and so on.  "
"So if m is even (say m = 2n), then the i‑th pair (for i = 1 to n) contributes 2i probes. The total probe cost T is then:  "
  T = 2 · (1 + 2 + … + n)  
And we know that 1 + 2 + … + n = n(n + 1)/2.  
"Thus,  "
  T = 2 · [n(n + 1)/2] = n(n + 1).  
Substituting n = m/2 gives:  
  T = (m/2) · (m/2 + 1).  
"As m grows large, (m/2) · (m/2 + 1) is Θ(m²)."
"Now, can you reflect on this revised analysis and try to explain in your own words why the total insertion time is Θ(m²) and what the summation tells us about the increasing probe costs as the table fills?"
Student: Absolutely! Thank you for the detailed explanation and guidance. Let's reflect on this revised analysis and summarize why the total insertion time is \( \Theta(m^2) \).
"From our earlier discussion, we noticed that as we insert keys into the hash table using the linear probing method, the costs associated with each insertion increase as more keys are added. Here's the breakdown of the reasoning:"
"1. **Initial Insertions**: The first few keys can be inserted with minimal probing since there are plenty of empty slots. For instance, the first two keys (1 and 2) each take only 1 probe because their target slots are unoccupied."
"2. **Collisions and Probing**: As we continue to insert keys, we start encountering collisions. For example, when we try to insert key 3, it hashes to a slot already occupied by key 2. This requires probing to find the next available slot, which increases the number of probes needed. "
"3. **Increasing Probe Costs**: As more keys are inserted, the number of occupied slots increases, leading to longer probe sequences for subsequent insertions. Specifically, for each pair of keys that collide, the second key in the pair tends to require more probes:"
   - The first pair (keys 1 and 2) takes \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) probes.
   - The second pair (keys 3 and 4) takes \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) probes.
"   - The third pair (keys 5 and 6) takes \( 3 + 3 = 6 \) probes, and so on."
4. **Summation of Probes**: This pattern leads us to recognize that the total number of probes can be expressed as a summation:
   \[
"   T = 2 \cdot (1 + 2 + \ldots + n) = n(n + 1),"
   \]
"   where \( n = \frac{m}{2} \). When we substitute \( n \) back in, we find:"
   \[
   T = \left(\frac{m}{2}\right) \left(\frac{m}{2} + 1\right) = \frac{m^2}{4} + \frac{m}{2}.
   \]
"   As \( m \) grows large, the dominating term is \( \frac{m^2}{4} \), which simplifies our total insertion time to \( \Theta(m^2) \)."
"5. **Conclusion**: Thus, the reason the total insertion time is \( \Theta(m^2) \) is that as the table fills up, the average number of probes needed for each subsequent key increases quadratically due to the linear probing nature of collision resolution. Each new insertion not only has to contend with previous keys but also adds to the probe complexity for future insertions."
"In summary, the quadratic growth in insertion time arises from the cumulative effect of increasing collisions and the need for additional probing, which scales with the number of keys being inserted. Thank you for helping clarify this important concept! Would you like to discuss anything further or explore additional examples?"
Teacher: Great explanation! You’ve clearly articulated why the increasing number of collisions causes the probe cost to grow quadratically. By summing the cost from each pair—where the i‑th pair contributes 2i probes—you obtained the summation
 T = 2 · (1 + 2 + … + n) = n(n + 1)
"with n = m/2. This shows that T = (m/2)(m/2 + 1) = (m²/4) + (m/2), which is dominated by the m² term as m becomes large. Therefore, the overall time for insertions is Θ(m²)."
Θ(m²)$
