"Question: We build a hashing table of size \( m \) using the linear probing method. The keys of the elements inserted into the table are taken from the set \( \{0, 1, \dots, 2m-1\} \). We use the following hash function:"
\[
h(k) = \left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor.
\]
"We insert the elements \( 1, 2, \dots, m \) into the table in increasing order. How much time does it take to insert all the elements into the table using the standard insertion algorithm? Provide an asymptotic bound."
"Teacher: Let's begin by understanding the problem more clearly. We have a hash table of size m and we’re inserting m keys (specifically, 1, 2, …, m) using linear probing. The hash function is defined as h(k) = ⌊k/2⌋."
"A good first step is to see what the hash function does to a few keys. For example, consider what h(1), h(2), h(3), and h(4) would be. This will help you understand how the keys are initially mapped into the table and hint at where collisions might occur."
"What values do you get when you compute h(1), h(2), h(3), and h(4)? Please provide those calculations as your next step."
Student: Sure! Let's compute the values of the hash function \( h(k) = \left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor \) for the keys 1 through 4.
1. For \( k = 1 \):
   \[
   h(1) = \left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.5 \right\rfloor = 0
   \]
2. For \( k = 2 \):
   \[
   h(2) = \left\lfloor \frac{2}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1 \right\rfloor = 1
   \]
3. For \( k = 3 \):
   \[
   h(3) = \left\lfloor \frac{3}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.5 \right\rfloor = 1
   \]
4. For \( k = 4 \):
   \[
   h(4) = \left\lfloor \frac{4}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2 \right\rfloor = 2
   \]
"So, the values we get are:"
- \( h(1) = 0 \)
- \( h(2) = 1 \)
- \( h(3) = 1 \)
- \( h(4) = 2 \)
"From this, we can see that \( h(2) \) and \( h(3) \) both hash to index 1, indicating a collision. This suggests that we will need to use linear probing for the insertion of these keys. "
Would you like me to proceed with analyzing the pattern of collisions and how that affects the time complexity for inserting all \( m \) elements?
"Teacher: Great job computing the hash values for keys 1 through 4! Now, let’s think more generally about what happens when we insert the keys in order, using this hash function. We want to determine how the collisions accumulate as we insert all m keys and then find an asymptotic bound on the total insertion time."
"A useful next step is to analyze the pattern of collisions. In particular, consider the following:"
• How do the keys distribute among the table slots based on h(k) = ⌊k/2⌋?
"• When a collision occurs (that is, when a slot is already occupied), how many probes might be needed until you find an empty spot?"
• How does inserting the keys in increasing order affect the length of the “probe sequence” for subsequent insertions?
Please reflect on these questions and try to identify the pattern of collisions. What is your reasoning on how many collisions or probes occur in total when inserting all m keys? Kindly provide your analysis for this next step.
Student: Sure! Let's analyze the distribution of keys and the resulting collisions based on the hash function \( h(k) = \left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor \).
1. **Distribution of Keys**:
"   - When we insert the keys \( 1, 2, \ldots, m \), the hash function maps them as follows:"
     - Keys \( 1 \) and \( 2 \) both hash to \( 0 \) and \( 1 \) respectively.
     - Keys \( 3 \) and \( 4 \) both hash to \( 1 \) and \( 2 \) respectively.
"     - In general, for keys \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, m \):"
"       - Keys \( 1, 2 \) hash to slots \( 0, 1 \)."
"       - Keys \( 3, 4 \) hash to slots \( 1, 2 \)."
"       - Keys \( 5, 6 \) hash to slots \( 2, 3 \)."
"       - Continuing this pattern, we can see that keys \( 2i-1 \) and \( 2i \) (where \( i \) is an integer) will hash to the same slot \( i-1 \) for \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, \left\lceil \frac{m}{2} \right\rceil \)."
2. **Collisions**:
"   - Each pair of keys \( (2i-1, 2i) \) will collide at slot \( i-1 \). Thus, for every \( i \) from \( 1 \) to \( \left\lceil \frac{m}{2} \right\rceil \), we have one collision for each pair."
"   - For \( m \) keys, there will be approximately \( \frac{m}{2} \) collisions since each pair of keys causes one collision."
3. **Probing**:
"   - When a collision occurs, linear probing will search for the next available slot. The first key in the pair will go to its hashed index, while the second key will find the next available slot."
"   - For the first key in each pair, there are no probes needed. However, for the second key in each pair, it may need to probe until it finds an empty slot. "
"   - As more keys are inserted, the likelihood of finding an empty slot decreases, leading to longer probe sequences."
4. **Total Probes**:
"   - The first key requires \( 1 \) probe, the second key may require \( 2 \) probes (in the worst case), the next key may require \( 3 \), and so on."
   - The total number of probes can be approximated by the sum of the first \( m \) integers:
     \[
     \text{Total Probes} = 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + m = \frac{m(m + 1)}{2} = O(m^2)
     \]
5. **Asymptotic Bound**:
"   - Thus, the total time taken to insert all \( m \) keys into the table using linear probing, considering the collisions and increasing probe lengths, is \( O(m^2) \)."
"In summary, the pattern of collisions leads to an increasing number of probes required for subsequent insertions, resulting in an asymptotic time complexity of \( O(m^2) \) for inserting all \( m \) elements into the hash table. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this analysis?"
"Teacher: You’ve made a good effort outlining the process, and you’ve correctly noted that many collisions occur and that the total cost sums up in a quadratic way. However, let’s look more carefully at the pattern of how the keys are distributed by the hash function."
"Notice that h(k) = ⌊k/2⌋, so for example:"
• h(1) = 0
• h(2) = 1
• h(3) = 1
• h(4) = 2
• h(5) = 2
• h(6) = 3  
…and so on.
"It appears that the keys don’t form neat pairs that both map to the same slot. Instead, observe that key 2 and key 3 both hash to 1, key 4 and key 5 both hash to 2, etc. This means collisions occur when a key’s hash equals that of the previous key, not that every pair (2i – 1, 2i) lands in the same slot."
"Could you revisit your analysis of the distribution of keys? Specifically, please try to:"
1. Re-describe how keys are mapped with examples.
"2. Identify exactly which keys collide (for instance, which keys end up in the same table slot)."
"3. Then, based on that more accurate mapping, reconsider how many probes are needed when inserting the m keys in order."
"Please work through this updated analysis for the pattern of collisions and let me know your thoughts on how the collisions add up, one step at a time."
Student: Sure! Let’s revisit the distribution of keys based on the hash function \( h(k) = \left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor \) and analyze the collisions more accurately.
1. **Mapping of Keys**:
   - The hash function maps keys as follows:
     - \( h(1) = 0 \)
     - \( h(2) = 1 \)
     - \( h(3) = 1 \)
     - \( h(4) = 2 \)
     - \( h(5) = 2 \)
     - \( h(6) = 3 \)
     - \( h(7) = 3 \)
     - \( h(8) = 4 \)
     - \( h(9) = 4 \)
"   - From this, we can see a clear pattern: every two consecutive keys \( k \) and \( k+1 \) (where \( k \) is odd) will hash to the same index \( \left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor \). Specifically:"
     - Keys \( 2 \) and \( 3 \) collide at index \( 1 \)
     - Keys \( 4 \) and \( 5 \) collide at index \( 2 \)
     - Keys \( 6 \) and \( 7 \) collide at index \( 3 \)
     - And so forth.
2. **Identifying Collisions**:
   - The collisions occur for every pair of keys:
"     - The keys \( 2i \) and \( 2i + 1 \) will collide at index \( i \) for \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, \left\lfloor \frac{m}{2} \right\rfloor \)."
"   - Therefore, for \( m \) keys, we have approximately \( \frac{m}{2} \) collisions since each pair contributes one collision."
3. **Probing**:
"   - When inserting the keys, the first key of each pair (like \( 2i \)) will go to its hashed index without any probing. The second key (like \( 2i + 1 \)), however, will need to probe for the next available slot."
   - The probing sequence will look like this:
     - For \( k = 1 \) (key \( 1 \)): 1 probe (goes to index 0)
     - For \( k = 2 \) (key \( 2 \)): 1 probe (goes to index 1)
"     - For \( k = 3 \) (key \( 3 \)): 2 probes (first tries index 1, then goes to index 2)"
     - For \( k = 4 \) (key \( 4 \)): 1 probe (goes to index 2)
"     - For \( k = 5 \) (key \( 5 \)): 2 probes (first tries index 2, then goes to index 3)"
     - For \( k = 6 \) (key \( 6 \)): 1 probe (goes to index 3)
"     - For \( k = 7 \) (key \( 7 \)): 2 probes (first tries index 3, then goes to index 4)"
"   - Continuing this pattern, we see that each time a collision occurs, the number of probes increases."
4. **Total Probes Calculation**:
"   - For each pair of keys \( (2i, 2i + 1) \), the first key takes 1 probe, while the second key takes an increasing number of probes depending on how many slots are already filled."
"   - Thus, the total number of probes can be summarized as:"
"     - For \( m \) keys, we can expect approximately \( 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + \ldots \) which leads to a series that can be approximated as:"
       \[
       \sum_{i=1}^{m} \text{(number of probes for key } i\text{)} = O(m) + O(m) = O(m^2)
       \]
5. **Asymptotic Bound**:
"   - Therefore, the time complexity for inserting all \( m \) elements into the hash table using linear probing, considering the collisions and the increasing number of probes, remains \( O(m^2) \)."
"In conclusion, the updated analysis shows that while the collisions do occur in pairs, the probing increases as we continue to insert keys, leading to the same asymptotic time complexity of \( O(m^2) \) for the total insertion time. Would you like to explore any further details or clarifications?"
Teacher: Great work revisiting the mapping! I’d like you to pause here and think through a few more points to solidify your analysis.
"You correctly noticed that, for example,  "
"• h(1) = 0,  "
"• h(2) = 1,  "
"• h(3) = 1, and  "
"• h(4) = 2,  "
"so the collision really happens between keys 2 and 3, then between keys 4 and 5, and so on."
"Before we proceed further, let’s consider the following:"
"1. When inserting in increasing order, note that key 1 gets inserted at its hash index with no problem. Then key 2 goes to index 1 without a collision. But when key 3 arrives, it hashes to index 1, which is already taken—so it must probe to the next free slot. At that point, you observed a similar pattern with keys 4 and 5."
"2. As more keys are inserted, clusters of filled slots will form. This means that subsequent keys could potentially need to probe more than just “1 extra” slot, because the cluster might extend further. In other words, the number of probes for a key may depend on the size of the cluster it encounters."
"With this in mind, could you now try to determine:"
" a. For the last few insertions (say, the mth key), what is the maximum number of probes you might need?  "
 b. How does that contribute to the overall sum of probes when all m keys are inserted?
"Please propose your reasoning regarding these two points. Remember, I’m here to help guide you through your analysis, so focus on explaining your thought process for just this next step."
"Student: Sure! Let’s think through the implications of inserting keys in increasing order and how that affects the number of probes needed, especially for the last few insertions."
### a. Maximum Number of Probes for the mth Key
"When we insert the keys \( 1, 2, \ldots, m \) into the hash table using the hash function \( h(k) = \left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor \), we can observe a few key points about the probing process:"
1. **Initial Insertions**:
   - The first few keys (like \( 1 \) and \( 2 \)) will insert into their respective slots without any collisions.
"   - However, starting from key \( 3 \), we see that keys \( 2 \) and \( 3 \) collide at index \( 1 \)."
2. **Formation of Clusters**:
"   - As we continue to insert keys, clusters of filled slots will form. For example, after inserting keys \( 1 \) through \( 6 \), we might have:"
     - Index \( 0 \): Key \( 1 \)
     - Index \( 1 \): Key \( 2 \)
     - Index \( 2 \): Key \( 4 \)
     - Index \( 3 \): Key \( 6 \)
     - Index \( 4 \): Key \( 5 \)
     - Index \( 5 \): Key \( 3 \)
"   - As more keys are inserted, the likelihood of encountering a filled slot increases, especially as the table fills up."
3. **Probing for the mth Key**:
"   - By the time we reach the \( m \)th key, it is likely that a significant number of slots are already filled. "
"   - The maximum number of probes needed for the \( m \)th key could be proportional to the number of occupied slots before it, which might be close to \( m \) itself in the worst-case scenario. Specifically, if all previous keys hash to the same or adjacent slots, the last key could require probing through several filled slots."
### b. Contribution to Overall Sum of Probes
1. **Total Probes Calculation**:
"   - As we insert each key, the number of probes can be thought of as an increasing sequence due to the clustering effect:"
     - For the first key: 1 probe
     - For the second key: 1 probe
     - For the third key: 2 probes (due to a collision)
     - For the fourth key: 1 probe
     - For the fifth key: 2 probes (due to a collision)
     - And so forth.
2. **As the Table Fills**:
"   - As we approach the \( m \)th key, the average number of probes for keys that collide will increase, leading to a scenario where the last few keys may require a significant number of probes."
"   - If we consider that, on average, the probing might be linear with respect to the number of filled slots, we could sum the probes needed for all keys:"
     \[
     \text{Total Probes} = O(1) + O(1) + O(2) + O(1) + O(2) + \ldots + O(k)
     \]
   - This results in a series that can be approximated as \( O(m) \) for each key contributing to an increasingly larger number of probes.
3. **Final Contribution**:
"   - The total number of probes, accounting for the increasing probe lengths as the table fills, leads to an overall sum that approximates to \( O(m^2) \) due to the quadratic nature of the summation of increasing sequences."
### Conclusion
"In summary, as we insert all \( m \) keys, the maximum number of probes for the \( m \)th key could approach \( m \) in the worst case due to the clustering of filled slots. This contributes to an overall time complexity of \( O(m^2) \) for the insertion process when considering all collisions and probe lengths. "
Would you like to delve deeper into any specific aspect of this analysis or clarify any points?
"Teacher: Great work analyzing the probing behavior! You've correctly identified that, as more keys are inserted, the clustering effect tends to increase the number of probes required—so that by the time you insert the mth key, you might end up probing nearly m slots in a worst-case scenario. You also noted that when summing all these probes over m insertions, the total accumulates in a quadratic order, leading to an overall cost of O(m²)."
"Now, let's go a bit further into the details of your analysis:"
"1. You mentioned that the mth key might require up to m probes. Can you think about whether this worst-case behavior applies to many keys or only a few? In other words, is the heavy cost of m probes something that happens often, or is it an extreme case?"
"2. Consider trying to explicitly set up a summation representing the total number of probes as you insert each key. For instance, if the first key takes 1 probe, the second takes 1, the third takes 2, and so on—how can you represent this sum? Can you use a simple summation formula (like the sum of the first n integers) to reason about the overall cost? "
Please work through these two points for this next step and share your reasoning.
Student: Sure! Let’s address both points you mentioned regarding the behavior of probes during the insertion of keys into the hash table.
### 1. Frequency of Maximum Probes
"While we noted that the mth key might require up to m probes in the worst-case scenario, it's important to consider how often this extreme case occurs:"
"- **Worst-case Probing**: The scenario where the mth key requires m probes would typically be rare. This would only happen if a significant number of earlier keys hashed to the same index or to adjacent indices, creating a long chain of filled slots that the mth key has to probe through."
"- **General Behavior**: In practice, while some keys may require multiple probes, most keys will likely require fewer probes due to the distribution of hash values. As we insert keys, the number of probes tends to stabilize around a lower average rather than consistently reaching the maximum. "
"- **Conclusion**: Thus, while it’s possible for the mth key to require m probes, this is not the norm for most keys. The average number of probes will be lower, leading to a less severe overall impact on the total insertion time than if all keys faced maximum probing."
### 2. Setting Up the Summation for Total Probes
"To represent the total number of probes required for all keys, we can set up a summation based on the probing behavior observed:"
- **Probes for Each Key**: Let’s denote the number of probes required for the \( i \)-th key as \( p(i) \).
"  - From our earlier analysis, we see that:"
    - \( p(1) = 1 \)
    - \( p(2) = 1 \)
    - \( p(3) = 2 \)
    - \( p(4) = 1 \)
    - \( p(5) = 2 \)
    - \( p(6) = 1 \)
    - \( p(7) = 2 \)
    - And this pattern continues.
"- **Summation Representation**: To find the total number of probes for all \( m \) keys, we can express it as:"
  \[
  \text{Total Probes} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} p(i)
  \]
"  - If we observe the pattern, we can see that:"
"    - For every two keys, one will require 1 probe and the other might require 2 probes due to collisions. This leads to a sum that can be approximated as:"
    \[
    \text{Total Probes} \approx 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + \ldots
    \]
- **Using Summation Formula**: We can simplify this to find a closed form. The number of probes can be thought of as approximately:
  \[
  \text{Total Probes} = O(1) + O(1) + O(2) + O(1) + O(2) + \ldots 
  \]
  - This can be represented as:
  \[
  \text{Total Probes} \approx O(m) + O(m) = O(m^2)
  \]
"  - This is because the series of probes can be summed as the first few integers, leading to a quadratic growth in total probes."
### Conclusion
"In summary, while the worst-case scenario of requiring m probes for the mth key is possible, it is not typical for most keys. The average number of probes is generally lower. The total number of probes can be represented as a summation that approximates to \( O(m^2) \) due to the cumulative nature of probing as the table fills up."
Would you like to explore any further details or clarify any points in this analysis?
"Teacher: You've provided a thoughtful discussion about the probing behavior and set the stage for a precise summation of the cost. Now, let's take the next step."
"You've noted that while extreme cases (like the last key possibly needing nearly m probes) are not typical, they contribute to the total cost, and you suggested that overall the probing cost seems to add up quadratically."
"To move forward, could you now write down a summation formula that represents the total number of probes over all m insertions? Explain carefully how each term in your sum relates to the probing behavior you described and why the sum adds up to O(m²) overall."
Give it a try with just your next step.
"Student: Sure! Let’s write down a summation formula that captures the total number of probes needed for all \( m \) insertions into the hash table, and explain how each term relates to the probing behavior."
### Summation of Total Probes
"We denote the number of probes required for the \( i \)-th key as \( p(i) \). Based on our earlier observations, we can describe the probing behavior as follows:"
1. **Probes for Each Key**:
   - The first key requires \( 1 \) probe: \( p(1) = 1 \).
   - The second key also requires \( 1 \) probe: \( p(2) = 1 \).
"   - The third key, which collides with the second, requires \( 2 \) probes: \( p(3) = 2 \)."
   - The fourth key requires \( 1 \) probe: \( p(4) = 1 \).
"   - The fifth key, colliding with the fourth, requires \( 2 \) probes: \( p(5) = 2 \)."
"   - This pattern continues, where every second key (the odd-indexed ones after the first) tends to require \( 2 \) probes due to collisions."
### Setting Up the Summation
"To represent the total number of probes, we can write:"
\[
\text{Total Probes} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} p(i)
\]
### Understanding the Terms
- For \( i = 1 \) to \( m \):
"  - For even \( i \) (like \( 2, 4, 6, \ldots \)), we typically see \( p(i) = 1 \)."
"  - For odd \( i \) (like \( 3, 5, 7, \ldots \)), we generally see \( p(i) = 2 \) due to the collisions with the previous even key."
### Summation Breakdown
"Thus, we can break down the summation into two parts:"
1. **Even Indexed Keys**:
"   - There are approximately \( \frac{m}{2} \) even keys, each contributing \( 1 \) probe."
   - Contribution from even keys: 
   \[
   \sum_{i \text{ even}} p(i) = \frac{m}{2} \times 1 = O(m)
   \]
2. **Odd Indexed Keys**:
"   - There are also approximately \( \frac{m}{2} \) odd keys, each contributing \( 2 \) probes."
   - Contribution from odd keys:
   \[
   \sum_{i \text{ odd}} p(i) = \frac{m}{2} \times 2 = O(m)
   \]
### Total Probes Calculation
"Combining both contributions, we have:"
\[
\text{Total Probes} = O(m) + O(m) = O(m)
\]
"However, this is a simplified view. The actual growth of probes can lead to cumulative increases as clusters form, leading to:"
\[
\text{Total Probes} = O(1) + O(1) + O(2) + O(1) + O(2) + O(1) + O(2) + \ldots
\]
This series approximates to the sum of the first \( m \) integers:
\[
\text{Total Probes} = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + \ldots \approx O(m^2)
\]
### Conclusion
"Thus, the total number of probes required for all \( m \) insertions can be expressed as:"
\[
\text{Total Probes} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} p(i) = O(m^2)
\]
"This quadratic growth reflects the cumulative effect of increasing probes as more keys are inserted, particularly due to clustering and collisions. Would you like to discuss any further points or clarify anything in this analysis?"
Teacher: Excellent work so far. You've set up a summation for the total number of probes over all m insertions. I’d like to guide you further by clarifying one point.
"You mentioned that half the keys contribute about 1 probe each while half contribute 2 probes, which would sum to O(m) if that were the whole story. However, as you’ve noted, due to clustering, the later insertions might require a number of probes that increases with the size of the cluster. In other words, it isn’t just a fixed 1 or 2 probes per key—the probe count may actually be growing as more keys are inserted."
"To refine our analysis, let’s try to describe the probe count for each insertion more precisely. For instance, think of describing the i‑th key’s number of probes p(i) as a function of i (or at least, understand how p(i) increases near the end of the insertion sequence). Could you try to explain how the probe counts for the later keys could be modeled and then write a summation that more clearly results in a quadratic total?"
Please go ahead and work on this next step.
"Student: Sure! Let's refine our analysis of the probes required for each insertion, especially focusing on how the probe counts for later keys can be modeled."
### Modeling the Probe Counts
"As we insert keys \(1, 2, \ldots, m\) into the hash table, the probing behavior can be influenced by how many slots are already filled. "
1. **Initial Keys**:
   - The first few keys (like \(1\) and \(2\)) will insert easily into their respective slots without any collisions. 
"   - However, starting from key \(3\), we begin to see collisions, particularly due to the way the hash function maps keys."
2. **Probing Behavior**:
"   - For each key \(k\), if \(h(k)\) points to an occupied slot, the number of probes \(p(k)\) will depend on how many keys have already been inserted that hash to that index or nearby indices."
"   - In general, the number of probes \(p(k)\) can increase as more keys are inserted, especially for keys near the end of the sequence."
3. **Estimating Probes for Later Keys**:
"   - For any key \(k\), if it collides with previous keys, we can think of the number of probes as being approximately proportional to the number of previously inserted keys that hash to the same index or nearby indices."
"   - As the hash table fills up, the likelihood of finding an empty slot decreases, leading to longer probe sequences. "
4. **Probing Function**:
   - We can model the number of probes for the \(i\)-th key as:
     \[
     p(i) = O(1) + O(1) + O(2) + O(1) + O(2) + \ldots + O(k)
     \]
"   - As the table fills, the number of probes can be approximated as:"
     \[
"     p(i) \approx \frac{i}{2} \quad \text{for later keys, since they will encounter more filled slots.}"
     \]
### Setting Up the Revised Summation
"Now, we can express the total number of probes as:"
\[
\text{Total Probes} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} p(i)
\]
Where \(p(i)\) increases with \(i\). 
1. **Summation Breakdown**:
"   - For the first few keys, we can assume they take a constant number of probes, say \(1\) or \(2\)."
"   - For later keys, particularly those closer to \(m\), we can approximate \(p(i)\) as growing linearly:"
     \[
     p(i) \approx \frac{i}{2} \quad \text{for } i \text{ near } m
     \]
2. **Total Probes Calculation**:
   - We can express the total probes as:
   \[
   \text{Total Probes} \approx \sum_{i=1}^{m} \frac{i}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{m} i
   \]
   - The sum of the first \(m\) integers is given by:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{m} i = \frac{m(m + 1)}{2}
   \]
"   - Thus, we can substitute this back into our expression:"
   \[
   \text{Total Probes} \approx \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{m(m + 1)}{2} = O(m^2)
   \]
### Conclusion
"In conclusion, by modeling the probe counts for later keys as growing with respect to the number of previously inserted keys, we arrive at a more precise summation. This leads us to conclude that the total number of probes required for all \(m\) insertions is:"
\[
\text{Total Probes} = O(m^2)
\]
This quadratic growth reflects the cumulative effect of increasing probe lengths as the table fills up and more collisions occur.
Would you like to explore any further details or clarify anything in this refined analysis?
Teacher: Great work on modeling the probe count for later keys and setting up the summation. To summarize your reasoning:
"• You observed that as keys get inserted, the number of probes for the i‑th key can be approximated as roughly proportional to i (or more precisely i/2 for the later keys when the table is filling up).  "
"• Therefore, the total number of probes over all m insertions can be approximated by the sum  "
  Total Probes ≈ (1/2) × (1 + 2 + 3 + … + m)  
"• Since we know 1 + 2 + 3 + … + m = m(m+1)/2, the total cost becomes  "
  (1/2) × (m(m+1)/2) = O(m²).
"Thus, the overall time to insert all m keys is O(m²)$"
