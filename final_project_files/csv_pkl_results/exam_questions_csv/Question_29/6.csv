"Question: Is it possible to implement an AVL tree such that the worst-case time complexity of the insert operation is \( O(1) \) and the delete operation takes \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the tree?"
"3o-mini: An AVL tree, by definition, is a balanced binary search tree. To maintain the AVL balancing invariant, every operation (including insertion) must perform a search to find the appropriate location in the tree and then possibly do some rotations. Even though the number of rotations for an insertion is bounded by a constant (in many cases, only one or two rotations are needed), the search itself traverses the tree’s height, which is O(log n) in the worst case."
"If one were to modify the implementation so that the insert operation took constant O(1) time in the worst case, you would have to bypass the necessary search or balancing checks—and that would fundamentally change how an AVL tree works (or even what it is). On the other hand, making deletion O(n) while keeping insertion O(1) would be an arbitrary and unsatisfactory trade‐off that also compromises the balanced nature and guaranteed performance of the AVL tree."
"Thus, it is not possible to have a valid AVL tree implementation where insertion is O(1) in the worst case while deletion is O(n). Both operations inherently rely on traversals that take at least O(log n) time in a balanced tree."
