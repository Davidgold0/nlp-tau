"Question: Is it possible to implement an AVL tree such that the worst-case time complexity of the insert operation is \( O(1) \) and the delete operation takes \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the tree?"
"3o-mini: The short answer is: No, it isn’t possible to have an AVL tree implementation where inserts are worst‐case O(1) while deletes are worst‐case O(n) if you insist on maintaining the AVL tree’s strict balancing invariants."
Here’s why:
"1. An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that maintains a strict balance condition: for every node, the heights of its two child subtrees differ by at most one. Maintaining this invariant is crucial for guaranteeing O(log n) search times."
"2. When you insert a node into an AVL tree, you must do more than just add a node. You must also update the height information along the insertion path and check each node for balance violations. If an imbalance is found, you perform one or more rotations to restore the balance. Even in the best designed AVL tree, the insertion operation takes O(log n) time in the worst case because the insertion path is of length O(log n) in a balanced tree."
"3. The idea of “shifting the work” so that an insert could be done in O(1) time by deferring some of the rebalancing work to a delete is not feasible if you want to maintain the AVL invariants at all times. If you delay rebalancing too long, the tree may lose its balanced property, and then operations like search or delete could not rely on O(log n) behavior either."
"4. In any balanced tree that adheres to a strict balance invariant like that of the AVL tree, the work to check and update balance cannot be reduced to constant time per insert without sacrificing the invariant or changing the tree’s structure significantly."
"Thus, if you alter the insert operation to make it constant time by deferring balancing work, then the tree is no longer an AVL tree in the strict sense. You might end up with a structure that has deferred rebalancing (sometimes called a ""lazy"" approach), but then the worst-case properties of search, delete, and even subsequent inserts can degrade until rebalancing is eventually performed."
"In conclusion, within the framework of AVL trees and their balancing rules, you cannot have a worst-case O(1) insertion while having deletion cost O(n). To maintain the AVL properties (and thus the guaranteed O(log n) search, insert, and delete times), each insertion must do O(log n) work in the worst case."
