"Question: Is it possible to implement an AVL tree such that the worst-case time complexity of the insert operation is \( O(1) \) and the delete operation takes \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the tree?"
"3o-mini: An AVL tree, by definition, is a self‐balancing binary search tree that maintains a strict height balance after every operation. In a standard AVL tree implementation, both insert and delete operations take O(log n) worst‐case time. This is because even though the number of rotations required during an insertion is constant in many cases, you still must update the heights (and check balance factors) along the insertion path, which takes O(log n) time."
Any attempt to make insertions run in O(1) worst-case time would entail either:
" • Defering all or part of the rebalancing work until a later operation (such as deletion), or"
 • Allowing the tree to temporarily violate the AVL balance invariant.
"For example, one might imagine a “lazy” approach where new nodes are added quickly in O(1) time (perhaps by attaching them without updating heights or doing rotations) and then fixing the balances later when deletions occur. However, this means that immediately after an insertion the tree is not an AVL tree. In this modified scheme the deletion operation would have to do the heavy lifting of restoring the AVL invariants (possibly taking O(n) time), and the tree would not enjoy the usual AVL guarantees (such as O(log n) search time) between operations."
"So, if you insist that the tree maintain the AVL balance property at all times, it is not possible to implement insert in O(1) worst-case time. Any “trade‐off” that achieves O(1) insertion by deferring work will result in deletions (or possibly searches) having a higher worst-case cost, and the data structure will no longer be a “proper” AVL tree immediately after each insertion."
"In summary: No, you cannot have a true AVL tree implementation with worst‐case O(1) inserts and O(n) deletes while maintaining the AVL balance invariant after every operation."
