Question: **Algorithm Description for Solving the Problem:**
"**Input:** A set \( \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\} = A \) of \( n \) numbers."
"**Goal:** The algorithm should construct a data structure \( DS \) in the best average-case time, with the following property: Given a collection \( S \) of \( m \) numbers, whose elements are taken from \( A \), we can use \( DS \) to sort the elements of \( S \) in \( O(\max(m, n)) \) worst-case time.  "
"Note that \( S \) may contain any element of \( A \) multiple times, so it is possible that \( m > n \)."
"3o-mini: We can solve the problem by “bucketing” the items in S according to the unique elements in A. In other words, we preprocess A to build a data structure DS that tells us the “order” of each element of A (or, equivalently, maps each element to a “bucket number”) so that later, when we are given an arbitrary collection S (with m elements, possibly with duplicates), we can “count” the occurrences of each element in S and then output the sorted list in O(m+n) worst‐case time (which is O(max(m, n)) when m and n are compared). One acceptable algorithm is described below."

Step 1. Preprocess A (Build DS):
"Input: Set A = {a₁, a₂, …, aₙ} of n numbers."
Goal: Build DS so that for any x ∈ A we can quickly find its “rank” (or bucket number) among the elements of A.
Method A (using sorting and perfect indexing):
"1. Sort A (there are n numbers). This gives you an increasing array SortedA = [b₁, b₂, …, bₙ] where b₁ < b₂ < … < bₙ."
"2. Create a mapping (for example, a hash table or an array if the numbers are in a small range) D where D[bᵢ] = i (its index in SortedA)."
It is possible to obtain an average-case time of O(n) for this step if you use a hash table (or other appropriate structure) and if you assume that the hash table operations are constant time on average.
"Method B (if the numbers are, say, integers in a limited range, you might use"
radix sort or even counting sort to obtain linear time preprocessing).
"At the end of step 1, DS consists of the sorted array SortedA and the dictionary D mapping each element in A to its rank/index."
────────────────────────────
Step 2. Sorting S using DS:
Input: Collection S of m numbers where each element comes from A.
"Goal: Output the sorted version of S in O(max(m,n)) worst-case time."
Procedure:
1. Allocate an auxiliary array Count of length n and initialize all entries to 0. (This takes O(n) time.)
2. For each element s in S (there are m elements):
   • Look up its index i = D[s] (using the dictionary built in DS).
   • Increment Count[i] by 1.
   This whole loop takes O(m) time.
"3. Finally, construct the sorted output:"
"   • For i from 1 to n, output the element SortedA[i] repeated Count[i] times."
"   This loop takes O(n + number_of_output_elements) time, which is O(n + m)."
"The total time for sorting S is O(n + m) = O(max(n, m)), as required."

Summary of the Algorithm:
Preprocessing (Building DS):
• Sort A to obtain SortedA.
• Build a dictionary D mapping each element in A to its position in SortedA.
• This step can be done in O(n) average-case (using hashing) or O(n log n) worst-case (if using comparison sort).
Sorting any given S:
• Initialize an array Count of length n.
"• For every s in S, use D to find its bucket and increment the corresponding count."
"• Finally, scan through SortedA and, for each element, output it Count times."
"• Total time: O(m + n) = O(max(m,n)) worst-case."
────────────────────────────
Why This Works:
"Since every element in S comes from A, and DS gives us the order in which the elements should appear, we avoid doing any comparisons between elements in S during the sort. We simply “count” the occurrences of each element and then output them in the correct (sorted) order."
"This satisfies the requirement: Given any S of size m (possibly with duplicates), we produce the sorted order in O(max(m, n)) worst-case time, and DS can be constructed in an optimal (average-case) time relative to n."
────────────────────────────
"Thus, one acceptable algorithm is to precompute a “bucket index” for each element of A and then use counting sort–like techniques on S to obtain the overall sorted order in O(max(m, n)) worst-case time."
