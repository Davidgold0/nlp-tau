"Question: Given an array of $n$ numbers. In all questions, we want to find an element that repeats a certain number of times in the array. If there is more than one such element, we should return one of them."
Propose an algorithm to find the repeating element in each of the following cases:
"\textbf{a.} It is known that there is an element that repeats at least $L$ times. In this case, randomness can be used."
"3o-mini: We can take advantage of the fact that if an element appears at least L times in an array of n numbers, then a uniformly chosen random element will be that element with probability at least L/n. Using this observation, we can design a randomized algorithm as follows:"
"1. Choose a constant c (say, c = 3) to be used for setting the number of trials."
2. Repeat the following for t = c·(n/L) iterations:
  a. Randomly select an index i from the range 1 to n.
  b. Let x = A[i].
  c. Scan the array and count the number of times x occurs.
"  d. If the count is at least L, then return x."
"3. Since we are guaranteed that there is an element that occurs at least L times, the probability that none of our t trials finds it is very low."
Analysis:
"• In each trial, the probability of picking the frequently occurring element is at least L/n."
"• After performing about c·(n/L) trials, the chance of missing the frequent element every time is (1 – L/n)^(c·(n/L)), which becomes very small for a suitably large constant c."
"• The worst-case time per trial is O(n) (to count occurrences), so the expected runtime is O((n^2)/L), which is quite efficient when L is relatively large."
This randomized method correctly and efficiently returns an element that repeats at least L times with high probability.
