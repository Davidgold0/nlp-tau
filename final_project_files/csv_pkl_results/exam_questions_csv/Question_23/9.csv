"Question: Given an array of $n$ numbers. In all questions, we want to find an element that repeats a certain number of times in the array. If there is more than one such element, we should return one of them."
Propose an algorithm to find the repeating element in each of the following cases:
"\textbf{a.} It is known that there is an element that repeats at least $L$ times. In this case, randomness can be used."
"3o-mini: We can take advantage of the fact that a frequent element (one that occurs at least L times) occupies at least a fraction L/n of the entries in the array. Thus if we pick an index uniformly at random from the array, the probability that we “hit” the frequent element is at least L/n."
One acceptable randomized algorithm proceeds as follows:

"Algorithm findRepeating(A, L):"
" Input: Array A of n numbers, and the frequency threshold L."
 Output: An element that occurs at least L times (if one exists).
"1. Let k = c · (n/L) for some constant c (for example, c = 3 or 4 will work to ensure high probability of success)."
2. For t = 1 to k do:
"  a. Pick an index i uniformly at random from {1, 2, …, n}."
  b. Let candidate = A[i].
  c. COUNT ← 0
"  d. For each element x in A, if x = candidate, then increment COUNT."
  e. If COUNT ≥ L then return candidate.
"3. (Optional) If no candidate was returned, you may either report failure (which happens with low probability, assuming an element really does occur L times) or increase c and repeat."

Explanation:
"• Since the frequent element appears at least L times, the chance to pick it in a single random selection is at least L/n."
"• After you pick an element, you scan the array to count its frequency. If the count is at least L then you have found a valid answer."
• Repeating the random pick O(n/L) times ensures (with high probability) that you will eventually hit a position that holds the frequent element.
Time Complexity Considerations:
"– Each iteration requires a scan of the entire array, so one iteration takes O(n) time."
"– The number of iterations is O(n/L). Hence, the expected running time is O(n · (n/L)) = O(n²/L)."
"Notice that if L is large (for example, if L is a constant fraction of n), then the expected time is O(n). (In many practical settings L will be “large enough” so that the overall running time is linear in n.) "
Alternative Approaches:
"If L is very small relative to n then the above algorithm might become inefficient. In that case you might prefer a deterministic algorithm using a hash table or sorting to count frequencies in O(n) or O(n log n) time. However, since the question explicitly allows randomness and assumes the existence of an element that appears L times, the randomized approach described above is perfectly acceptable."
"This algorithm meets the requirements: it returns (with high probability) an element that appears at least L times, and if more than one qualifies, the one returned depends on the random choices made."
