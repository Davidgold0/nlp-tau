"Question: William is taking the 25-question, multiple choice American Mathematics Competition. Each question has five answer choices. William guesses random answers for the last four questions. What is the probability that he will get at least one of these final four questions right?"
"3o-mini: For each question, the probability of guessing the correct answer is 1/5, and the probability of an incorrect answer is 4/5."
"William guesses on 4 questions, and to calculate the chance of getting at least one right, it's easier to first find the probability of getting none right (i.e., all wrong) and then subtract from 1."
Probability of getting a single question wrong = 4/5  
Probability of getting all four wrong = (4/5)‚Å¥ = 256/625
"Therefore, the probability that he gets at least one correct is:"
1 - (Probability of all wrong) = 1 - 256/625 = (625 - 256)/625 = 369/625
"So, the probability that William gets at least one correct answer on the last four questions is 369/625."
