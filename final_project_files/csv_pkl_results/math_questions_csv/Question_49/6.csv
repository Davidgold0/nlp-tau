Question: What is the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $8x^2 - 38x + 35 = 0$? Express your answer as a decimal.
"3o-mini: To solve the quadratic equation 8x² - 38x + 35 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:"
  x = ( -b ± √(b² - 4ac) ) / (2a)
"Here, a = 8, b = -38, and c = 35."
1. Calculate the discriminant (b² - 4ac):
  (-38)² - 4(8)(35) = 1444 - 1120 = 324
2. Take the square root of the discriminant:
  √324 = 18
3. Substitute into the quadratic formula:
  x = (38 ± 18) / (16)
"Now, we have two possible solutions:"
  x = (38 + 18) / 16 = 56 / 16 = 3.5
  x = (38 - 18) / 16 = 20 / 16 = 1.25
The smallest value of x is 1.25.
