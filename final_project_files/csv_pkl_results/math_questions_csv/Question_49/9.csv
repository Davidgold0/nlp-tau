Question: What is the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $8x^2 - 38x + 35 = 0$? Express your answer as a decimal.
"3o-mini: To solve the quadratic equation 8x² - 38x + 35 = 0, we use the quadratic formula:"
  x = [–b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)
"Here, a = 8, b = -38, and c = 35. Substitute these in:"
  x = [38 ± √((-38)² - 4(8)(35))] / (2(8))
  x = [38 ± √(1444 - 1120)] / 16
  x = [38 ± √324] / 16
"Since √324 = 18, the solutions become:"
  x = (38 + 18) / 16 = 56/16 = 3.5  
  x = (38 - 18) / 16 = 20/16 = 1.25
The smallest value of x that satisfies the equation is 1.25.
