Question: What is the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $8x^2 - 38x + 35 = 0$? Express your answer as a decimal.
3o-mini: We start with the quadratic equation:
  8x² - 38x + 35 = 0
"Using the quadratic formula, x = [ -b ± √(b² - 4ac) ] / (2a), where a = 8, b = -38, and c = 35."
"First, compute the discriminant:"
  b² - 4ac = (-38)² - 4(8)(35) = 1444 - 1120 = 324
Taking the square root of the discriminant:
  √324 = 18
"Now, plug in the values into the quadratic formula:"
  x = [38 ± 18] / (16)
We get two solutions:
"  x = (38 + 18) / 16 = 56 / 16 = 3.5, and"
  x = (38 - 18) / 16 = 20 / 16 = 1.25
"Since we want the smallest value of x, the answer is 1.25."
