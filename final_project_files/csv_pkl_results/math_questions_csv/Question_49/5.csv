Question: What is the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $8x^2 - 38x + 35 = 0$? Express your answer as a decimal.
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the structure of the quadratic equation you're given:
"The equation is 8x² - 38x + 35 = 0. One common method to solve such equations is to use the quadratic formula, which is:"
  x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)
"Step 1: Identify the coefficients a, b, and c in the equation."
"Could you tell me what the values of a, b, and c are?"
"Student: Sure! In the equation \(8x^2 - 38x + 35 = 0\), we can identify the coefficients as follows:"
- \(a = 8\) (the coefficient of \(x^2\))
- \(b = -38\) (the coefficient of \(x\))
- \(c = 35\) (the constant term)
"So, we have \(a = 8\), \(b = -38\), and \(c = 35\). What's the next step?"
Teacher: Great job identifying the coefficients! The next step is to calculate the discriminant using the formula:
"  Discriminant, D = b² - 4ac"
"Using the values a = 8, b = -38, and c = 35, can you compute the discriminant? Please show your calculation for this step."
"Student: Sure! To calculate the discriminant \(D\), we use the formula:"
\[
D = b^2 - 4ac
\]
"Now, substituting the values we identified:"
- \(a = 8\)
- \(b = -38\)
- \(c = 35\)
We calculate \(D\) as follows:
\[
D = (-38)^2 - 4(8)(35)
\]
Calculating \((-38)^2\):
\[
(-38)^2 = 1444
\]
Now calculating \(4(8)(35)\):
\[
4(8)(35) = 4 \times 8 \times 35 = 1120
\]
"Now, substituting these values back into the discriminant formula:"
\[
D = 1444 - 1120 = 324
\]
So the discriminant \(D\) is \(324\). What should I do next?
"Teacher: Excellent work calculating the discriminant! Now, the next step is to apply the quadratic formula:"
  x = (-b ± √D) / (2a)
"We already have a = 8, b = -38, and D = 324. Could you please compute the value of √324 and then substitute everything into the quadratic formula to determine the two solutions for x? Focus on finding the smallest solution, as that’s what the question asks for. Let me know your work for this step."
"Student: Sure! First, let's calculate \( \sqrt{324} \):"
\[
\sqrt{324} = 18
\]
"Now, we can substitute the values into the quadratic formula:"
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{D}}{2a}
\]
"Substituting \( b = -38 \), \( \sqrt{D} = 18 \), and \( a = 8 \):"
\[
x = \frac{-(-38) \pm 18}{2 \times 8}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x = \frac{38 \pm 18}{16}
\]
"Now, we can calculate the two possible solutions for \(x\):"
1. For the positive case:
\[
x_1 = \frac{38 + 18}{16} = \frac{56}{16} = 3.5
\]
2. For the negative case:
\[
x_2 = \frac{38 - 18}{16} = \frac{20}{16} = 1.25
\]
"Now, we have two solutions: \( x_1 = 3.5 \) and \( x_2 = 1.25 \). Since the question asks for the smallest value of \(x\), the smallest solution is:"
\[
\boxed{1.25}
\] 
Is that correct?
"Teacher: Excellent work! Your reasoning and calculations are all correct. You've identified the correct values for a, b, and c, computed the discriminant, taken its square root, applied the quadratic formula, and then chosen the smallest solution correctly. "
Your final answer is: 
1.25$
