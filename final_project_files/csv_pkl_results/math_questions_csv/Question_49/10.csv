Question: What is the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $8x^2 - 38x + 35 = 0$? Express your answer as a decimal.
"3o-mini: To solve the quadratic equation 8x² - 38x + 35 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula: "
  x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)
For this equation:
"  a = 8, b = -38, c = 35."
"First, calculate the discriminant:"
  Discriminant = (-38)² - 4(8)(35) = 1444 - 1120 = 324.
"Next, take the square root of the discriminant:"
  √324 = 18.
"Now, substitute into the quadratic formula:"
  x = [38 ± 18] / 16.
This gives us two solutions:
"  x = (38 + 18) / 16 = 56 / 16 = 3.5,"
  x = (38 - 18) / 16 = 20 / 16 = 1.25.
The smallest value is x = 1.25.
