Question: What is the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $8x^2 - 38x + 35 = 0$? Express your answer as a decimal.
"3o-mini: To solve the equation 8x² - 38x + 35 = 0, we use the quadratic formula:"
  x = (–b ± √(b² – 4ac)) / (2a)
"Here, a = 8, b = –38, and c = 35."
Step 1: Calculate the discriminant:
  b² – 4ac = (–38)² – 4(8)(35) = 1444 – 1120 = 324
Step 2: Take the square root of the discriminant:
  √324 = 18
Step 3: Compute the two solutions:
  x = (38 ± 18) / (16)
The two values for x are:
  x = (38 + 18) / 16 = 56 / 16 = 3.5
  x = (38 – 18) / 16 = 20 / 16 = 1.25
"Since we need the smallest value, the answer is 1.25."
