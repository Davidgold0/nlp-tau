Question: What is the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $8x^2 - 38x + 35 = 0$? Express your answer as a decimal.
Teacher: Let's start by outlining the steps needed to solve the problem:
1. Recognize that the equation 8x² - 38x + 35 = 0 is a quadratic equation.
"2. Identify the coefficients: a, b, and c."
3. Use the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a).
"4. Compute the discriminant, which is b² - 4ac."
5. Evaluate the square root of the discriminant.
6. Substitute the values back into the quadratic formula to find the two solutions.
7. Identify the smallest value (the smaller solution) and express it as a decimal.
"Let's begin with step 1: Identify the coefficients a, b, and c. Could you tell me what the values of a, b, and c are in the equation 8x² - 38x + 35 = 0?"
"Student: Sure! In the quadratic equation \(8x^2 - 38x + 35 = 0\), the coefficients are:"
- \(a = 8\)
- \(b = -38\)
- \(c = 35\)
Would you like me to proceed to the next step?
"Teacher: Excellent! You've correctly identified the coefficients as a = 8, b = -38, and c = 35."
"Now, let's move on to the next step: calculate the discriminant, which is given by the expression b² - 4ac."
Could you please compute the value of b² - 4ac for this equation?
"Student: Student: Sure! To calculate the discriminant \(b^2 - 4ac\), we can substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that we identified earlier."
"1. First, calculate \(b^2\):"
   \[
   b^2 = (-38)^2 = 1444
   \]
"2. Next, calculate \(4ac\):"
   \[
   4ac = 4 \cdot 8 \cdot 35 = 1120
   \]
"3. Now, we can find the discriminant:"
   \[
   b^2 - 4ac = 1444 - 1120 = 324
   \]
"So, the discriminant is \(324\). Would you like me to move on to the next step?"
Teacher: Great work! Your calculation of the discriminant is correct; it is indeed 324.
"Now, let's move to the next step: finding the square root of the discriminant. Could you please compute √324?"
Student: Sure! The square root of 324 can be calculated as follows:
\[
\sqrt{324} = 18
\]
"So, \( \sqrt{324} = 18 \). Would you like me to proceed to the next step?"
Teacher: Great job on finding the square root of the discriminant!
"Now, let's move on to the next step: using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is given by"
  x = (–b ± √(b² – 4ac)) / (2a).
"Could you please substitute the values we have—remember, a = 8, b = –38, and √(b² – 4ac) = 18—into this formula and simplify it to find the two solutions? Take your time and show your work for this step."
Student: Sure! Let's substitute the values into the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
Substituting in the values we have:
- \(a = 8\)
- \(b = -38\)
- \(\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} = 18\)
This gives us:
\[
x = \frac{-(-38) \pm 18}{2 \cdot 8}
\]
Simplifying this step-by-step:
1. Calculate \(-(-38)\):
   \[
   -(-38) = 38
   \]
2. Now substitute this back into the equation:
   \[
   x = \frac{38 \pm 18}{16}
   \]
3. Now we can split this into two separate equations to find the two solutions:
   - For the positive case:
   \[
   x_1 = \frac{38 + 18}{16} = \frac{56}{16} = 3.5
   \]
   - For the negative case:
   \[
   x_2 = \frac{38 - 18}{16} = \frac{20}{16} = 1.25
   \]
So the two solutions we have are \(x_1 = 3.5\) and \(x_2 = 1.25\).
"Now, can you help me identify the smallest value of \(x\) from these two solutions?"
"Teacher: You've successfully found the two solutions: one is 3.5 and the other is 1.25. Now, can you tell me which of these two values is the smallest? Please explain your reasoning before moving on."
Student: Sure! We have the two solutions: \(x_1 = 3.5\) and \(x_2 = 1.25\). 
"To identify the smallest value, we can compare the two numbers. "
- \(3.5\) is greater than \(1.25\).
- \(1.25\) is less than \(3.5\).
"Therefore, the smallest value of \(x\) that satisfies the equation is \(1.25\)."
"Would you like me to express this as a decimal, or is there anything else you would like to discuss?"
Teacher: You've done a fantastic job working through all the steps. To summarize:
"1. You correctly identified the coefficients a = 8, b = -38, and c = 35."
2. You accurately computed the discriminant as 324.
3. You found √324 = 18.
4. You substituted the values into the quadratic formula and found the two solutions: 3.5 and 1.25.
5. You correctly determined that the smaller of the two is 1.25.
"Since you've reached the final answer, the smallest value of x is 1.25$"
