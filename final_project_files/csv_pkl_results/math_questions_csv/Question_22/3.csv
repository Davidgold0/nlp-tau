Question: Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $1.2n-4.4<5.2$.
"Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem. We need to find all positive integers n such that the inequality 1.2n - 4.4 < 5.2 holds, and then sum those values."
Here are the steps we should follow:
1. Isolate the term with n in the inequality.
2. Solve the inequality to find the range of n.
3. Identify which positive integers fall within that range.
4. Sum up those integers.
"For now, let's focus on the first step: isolate the term with n. How would you begin to isolate 1.2n in the inequality 1.2n - 4.4 < 5.2?"
"Student: To isolate the term with \( n \) in the inequality \( 1.2n - 4.4 < 5.2 \), I will add \( 4.4 \) to both sides of the inequality. "
"So, the steps would look like this:"
1. Start with the original inequality:
   \[
   1.2n - 4.4 < 5.2
   \]
2. Add \( 4.4 \) to both sides:
   \[
   1.2n < 5.2 + 4.4
   \]
3. Simplifying the right side gives:
   \[
   1.2n < 9.6
   \]
"Now, I have isolated the term with \( n \). What should I do next?"
Teacher: Great job on isolating the term with n! You correctly added 4.4 to both sides and simplified the inequality to get 1.2n < 9.6.
"Now, for the next step: solve for n by dividing both sides by 1.2. What value do you get for n after performing that division?"
"Student: To solve for \( n \), I will divide both sides of the inequality \( 1.2n < 9.6 \) by \( 1.2 \)."
"So, the steps look like this:"
1. Start with the inequality:
   \[
   1.2n < 9.6
   \]
2. Divide both sides by \( 1.2 \):
   \[
   n < \frac{9.6}{1.2}
   \]
"3. Now, calculating \( \frac{9.6}{1.2} \):"
   \[
   \frac{9.6}{1.2} = 8
   \]
"So, we have:"
\[
n < 8
\]
"Now, what should I do next?"
"Teacher: Excellent work solving for n so that n < 8! Now, let's move on to the next step: identifying which positive integers satisfy the inequality n < 8. Since n must be a positive integer, which values of n do you get? Please list them."
"Student: To find the positive integers that satisfy the inequality \( n < 8 \), we consider all positive integers less than 8. "
The positive integers that meet this condition are:
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7."
"Now, what should I do next with these values?"
"Teacher: Great work identifying the appropriate positive integers, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7! Now for the next step, we need to find the sum of all these integers. How would you go about adding them together? Please calculate the sum, and let me know your result."
"Student: To find the sum of the positive integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, I will add them together. "
We can do this step by step:
"1. First, I can group them for easier addition:"
   \[
   (1 + 7) + (2 + 6) + (3 + 5) + 4
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   8 + 8 + 4 = 20
   \]
"Alternatively, I can add them sequentially:"
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28
\]
"So, the sum of all positive integers \( n \) such that \( n < 8 \) is \( 28 \)."
Is there anything else I should do?
"Teacher: Great effort! You've correctly identified the positive integers that satisfy n < 8 (namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) and then worked at finding their sum. "
"I noticed you presented two different grouping methods: one grouping that initially seemed to give 20, then a sequential calculation giving 28. Let's check the grouping carefully: "
• Pairing (1 + 7) gives 8.
• Pairing (2 + 6) gives 8.
• Pairing (3 + 5) gives 8.
• The remaining number is 4.
• Now add these together: 8 + 8 + 8 + 4 = 28.
So the correct sum is indeed 28.
To summarize:
1. You started with the inequality: 1.2n - 4.4 < 5.2.
2. You added 4.4 to both sides to isolate 1.2n.
3. You then divided by 1.2 to obtain n < 8.
"4. Next, you listed all positive integers satisfying n < 8."
"5. Finally, you summed these values to arrive at 28."
"Now that you've reached the final answer, here it is:"
28$
