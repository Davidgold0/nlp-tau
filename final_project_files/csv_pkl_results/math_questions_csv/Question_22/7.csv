Question: Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $1.2n-4.4<5.2$.
3o-mini: We start with the inequality:
  1.2n – 4.4 < 5.2
"First, add 4.4 to both sides:"
  1.2n < 5.2 + 4.4
  1.2n < 9.6
"Now, divide by 1.2:"
  n < 9.6 ÷ 1.2
  n < 8
"Since n must be a positive integer, the possible values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7."
"Finally, we find the sum:"
  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28
"Thus, the sum of all positive integers n that satisfy the inequality is 28."
