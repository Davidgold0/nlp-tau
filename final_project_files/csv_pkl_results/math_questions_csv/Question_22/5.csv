Question: Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $1.2n-4.4<5.2$.
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem. We have the inequality: 
  1.2n – 4.4 < 5.2
Step 1 is to isolate the term with n. Can you try to figure out what operation you need to perform on both sides of the inequality to begin isolating n? Please share your thoughts on this first step.
"Student: To begin isolating \( n \) in the inequality \( 1.2n - 4.4 < 5.2 \), I need to eliminate the constant term on the left side, which is \(-4.4\). "
"To do this, I can add \( 4.4 \) to both sides of the inequality. This will help me get \( n \) by itself on one side. "
"So, my first step will be:"
\[
1.2n - 4.4 + 4.4 < 5.2 + 4.4
\]
"Now, can you confirm if this is the right approach?"
"Teacher: You're absolutely right! Adding 4.4 to both sides is the correct approach to start isolating n. Now, please simplify both sides of the inequality after adding 4.4. What do you get for the expression on the left and the right?"
"Student: Student: After adding \( 4.4 \) to both sides of the inequality, we have:"
\[
1.2n < 5.2 + 4.4
\]
"Now, simplifying the right side:"
\[
5.2 + 4.4 = 9.6
\]
So the inequality now looks like this:
\[
1.2n < 9.6
\]
Is that correct? What should I do next?
"Teacher: Excellent work simplifying! Now, as your next step, you'll need to isolate n completely by dividing both sides of the inequality by 1.2. Since 1.2 is a positive number, the direction of the inequality remains the same. "
Please perform this division step and tell me what the inequality becomes.
"Student: To isolate \( n \), I will divide both sides of the inequality \( 1.2n < 9.6 \) by \( 1.2 \). "
"Doing the division, I have:"
\[
n < \frac{9.6}{1.2}
\]
"Now, let's simplify the right side. Calculating \( \frac{9.6}{1.2} \):"
\[
\frac{9.6}{1.2} = 8
\]
So the inequality becomes:
\[
n < 8
\]
Is this correct? What should I do next?
"Teacher: Great job isolating n to get n < 8! Now, since we're only interested in positive integers, what positive integer values can n take that satisfy n < 8? Once you've listed them, please calculate their sum. Take your time, and share your thoughts on this next step."
"Student: To find the positive integer values of \( n \) that satisfy the inequality \( n < 8 \), we can list the positive integers less than 8:"
The positive integers are: 
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7"
"Now, to find the sum of these integers, I can add them together:"
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7
\]
Calculating this step-by-step:
\[
1 + 2 = 3
\]
\[
3 + 3 = 6
\]
\[
6 + 4 = 10
\]
\[
10 + 5 = 15
\]
\[
15 + 6 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 7 = 28
\]
"So, the sum of all positive integers \( n \) such that \( n < 8 \) is \( 28 \)."
Is this the correct approach and final answer?
"Teacher: You're on the right track, and your work is accurate. The correct list of positive integers n that satisfy n < 8 is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, and their sum is indeed 28."
