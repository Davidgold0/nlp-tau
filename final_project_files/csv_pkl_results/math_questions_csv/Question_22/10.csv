Question: Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $1.2n-4.4<5.2$.
3o-mini: We start with the inequality: 
  1.2n – 4.4 < 5.2
Step 1: Add 4.4 to both sides:
  1.2n < 5.2 + 4.4
  1.2n < 9.6
Step 2: Divide both sides by 1.2:
  n < 9.6 / 1.2
  n < 8
"Since n is a positive integer, the possible values for n are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7."
Step 3: Find the sum of these numbers:
Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28
"Therefore, the sum of all positive integers n that satisfy the inequality is 28."
