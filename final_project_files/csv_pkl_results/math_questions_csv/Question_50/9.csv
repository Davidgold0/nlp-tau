"Question: If $F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c \times d$, what is the value of $x$ such that $F(2, x, 4, 11) = 300$?"
"3o-mini: We are given F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c × d. Plugging in a = 2, c = 4, d = 11, and letting b = x, we have:"
"  F(2, x, 4, 11) = 2^x + 4 × 11"
"Since 4 × 11 = 44, this becomes:"
  2^x + 44 = 300
Subtract 44 from both sides:
  2^x = 300 - 44 = 256
"We see that 256 is a power of 2. In fact, 2^8 = 256."
"Thus, x = 8."
