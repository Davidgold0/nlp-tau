"Question: If $F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c \times d$, what is the value of $x$ such that $F(2, x, 4, 11) = 300$?"
"3o-mini: We start with the function F defined by F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c × d. Given the values a = 2, c = 4, and d = 11, the function becomes:"
" F(2, x, 4, 11) = 2^x + 4 × 11"
"Since 4 × 11 equals 44, this simplifies to:"
 2^x + 44 = 300
Subtract 44 from both sides to isolate the exponential term:
 2^x = 300 - 44  
 2^x = 256
"Recognizing that 256 is a power of 2, we recall that 2^8 = 256. Therefore, we have:"
 2^x = 2^8
"Since the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal, yielding:"
 x = 8
"Thus, the value of x such that F(2, x, 4, 11) equals 300 is 8."
