"Question: If $F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c \times d$, what is the value of $x$ such that $F(2, x, 4, 11) = 300$?"
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem into clear steps.
Step 1: Substitute the given values into the function. We have the function
"  F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c × d"
"and in this case, a = 2, b = x, c = 4, and d = 11. Can you write the expression for F(2, x, 4, 11) using these substitutions? Please show your work for this step."
"Student: Sure! Let's substitute the values into the function \( F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c \times d \)."
Given:
- \( a = 2 \)
- \( b = x \)
- \( c = 4 \)
- \( d = 11 \)
"Now, substituting these values, we get:"
\[
"F(2, x, 4, 11) = 2^x + 4 \times 11"
\]
"Next, we can calculate \( 4 \times 11 \):"
\[
4 \times 11 = 44
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
"F(2, x, 4, 11) = 2^x + 44"
\]
Is that correct? What should I do next?
"Teacher: Great job on that substitution! Your work so far looks good. Now, for the next step:"
"We know that F(2, x, 4, 11) equals 300. Can you set up the equation by equating your expression 2^x + 44 to 300? Once you do that, isolate 2^x by subtracting the constant term. Please show your work for this step."
"Student: Student: Thank you! Now, I'll set up the equation by equating the expression we found to 300."
We have:
\[
2^x + 44 = 300
\]
"Next, to isolate \( 2^x \), I will subtract 44 from both sides:"
\[
2^x = 300 - 44
\]
Calculating the right side gives:
\[
2^x = 256
\]
Is that correct? What should I do next?
Teacher: Excellent work so far! You've correctly set up the equation:
  2^x + 44 = 300  
  => 2^x = 256
"Now, for the next step, we need to solve the equation 2^x = 256. Please express 256 as a power of 2 and then determine the value of x. Show your work for this step."
"Student: Student: Thank you! Now, I need to express 256 as a power of 2. "
We know that:
\[
2^8 = 256
\]
So we can rewrite the equation \( 2^x = 256 \) as:
\[
2^x = 2^8
\]
"Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:"
\[
x = 8
\]
Is that the correct value for \( x \)? What should I do next?
"Teacher: Great job! You've accurately rewritten 256 as 2^8 and then correctly set the equation 2^x = 2^8, which leads to x = 8."
To summarize our process:
"1. We substituted the values into the function to get F(2, x, 4, 11) = 2^x + 44."
"2. We set up and solved the equation 2^x + 44 = 300 by isolating 2^x, giving us 2^x = 256."
3. We expressed 256 as 2^8 and equated the exponents to conclude that x = 8.
Your reasoning is clear and correct!
