"Question: If $F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c \times d$, what is the value of $x$ such that $F(2, x, 4, 11) = 300$?"
"3o-mini: We are given the function F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c × d. Plugging in the values 2, x, 4, and 11, the function becomes:"
  2^x + 4 × 11 = 300
"First, calculate 4 × 11:"
  2^x + 44 = 300
Subtract 44 from both sides:
  2^x = 256
"Now, determine what exponent x makes 2^x equal to 256. Since 2^8 = 256, we have:"
  x = 8
"Thus, the value of x is 8."
