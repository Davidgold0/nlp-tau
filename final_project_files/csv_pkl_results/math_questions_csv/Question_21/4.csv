Question: Solve for $n$: $|n + 6| = 2 - n$.
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem: We need to solve for n from the equation |n + 6| = 2 – n.
"Before jumping into calculations, here’s an outline of the steps to solve this equation:"
"1. Recognize that the absolute value function can be split into two cases. However, note that the right-hand side of the equation, 2 – n, must be nonnegative because an absolute value cannot be negative."
2. Determine the condition for 2 – n to be nonnegative. This will restrict the values of n you consider.
3. Consider the two cases for the expression inside the absolute value:
   a. Case 1: n + 6 is nonnegative.
   b. Case 2: n + 6 is negative.
"4. Solve the equation in each case, taking into account the condition from step 2."
"5. Finally, check that your solutions satisfy any restrictions or the original equation."
"Let’s begin with the first step: determine for what values of n the right-hand side, 2 – n, is nonnegative. "
Can you work through that step and tell me what inequality you get for n?
"Student: Sure! To find the values of \( n \) for which the right-hand side \( 2 - n \) is nonnegative, we can set up the inequality:"
\[
2 - n \geq 0
\]
"Now, let's solve this inequality:"
1. Add \( n \) to both sides:
\[
2 \geq n
\]
"or, equivalently,"
\[
n \leq 2
\]
"So, the condition we have determined is that \( n \) must be less than or equal to 2. "
Would you like me to move on to the next step and consider the two cases for the absolute value?
Teacher: Great work establishing that n must be less than or equal to 2. 
Now let's move on to the next part: we need to consider the two cases for the absolute value expression. 
"Let's start with Case 1: Assume that the expression inside the absolute value is nonnegative. In other words, assume n + 6 ≥ 0 (which means n ≥ -6). Under this assumption, the absolute value expression |n + 6| simply becomes n + 6. "
So the equation becomes:  
n + 6 = 2 – n
Could you please solve this equation for n under the condition that n ≥ -6? Take your time and show your work for this step.
"Student: Sure! Given the equation from Case 1, where we assume \( n + 6 \geq 0 \) and thus \( |n + 6| = n + 6 \), we have:"
\[
n + 6 = 2 - n
\]
"Now, let's solve for \( n \):"
"1. First, we can add \( n \) to both sides:"
\[
n + n + 6 = 2
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2n + 6 = 2
\]
"2. Next, we subtract 6 from both sides:"
\[
2n = 2 - 6
\]
\[
2n = -4
\]
"3. Now, divide both sides by 2:"
\[
n = -2
\]
"Now, we need to check if this solution \( n = -2 \) satisfies our condition from Case 1, which is \( n \geq -6 \). Since \( -2 \) is greater than \( -6 \), it meets the condition."
Would you like me to move on to Case 2 now?
"Teacher: Great job on solving Case 1! Now, let’s move on to Case 2."
"For Case 2, we assume that the expression inside the absolute value is negative. That means we assume:  "
  n + 6 < 0  
This also implies n < -6.
"Under this assumption, the absolute value expression becomes:  "
  |n + 6| = -(n + 6) = -n - 6
"Thus, the original equation becomes:  "
  -n - 6 = 2 – n
"Now, please solve this equation under the assumption that n < -6, and be sure to check that any solution you find satisfies n < -6. What do you get?"
"Student: Sure! For Case 2, where we assume \( n + 6 < 0 \), we have:"
\[
|n + 6| = -(n + 6) = -n - 6
\]
"So, the equation becomes:"
\[
-n - 6 = 2 - n
\]
"Now, let's solve for \( n \):"
"1. First, we can add \( n \) to both sides:"
\[
-n + n - 6 = 2 - n + n
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-6 = 2
\]
"This equation is not valid, which means there are no solutions from Case 2."
"Now, we need to check if any solutions we found satisfy the condition \( n < -6 \). Since we found no valid equation in Case 2, we don’t have any solutions from this case."
"Now, let’s summarize what we have:"
"- From Case 1, we found \( n = -2 \), which satisfies \( n \geq -6 \)."
"- From Case 2, there are no valid solutions."
"Thus, the only solution to the original equation \( |n + 6| = 2 - n \) is:"
\[
n = -2
\]
Would you like me to check this solution back in the original equation to verify?
"Teacher: That’s a great summary of both cases, and you’ve shown that n = -2 is the only solution. Checking the solution in the original equation is always a good idea. Instead of me doing the check directly, could you please substitute n = -2 into the equation |n + 6| = 2 – n and show that both sides are equal?"
Student: Sure! Let's substitute \( n = -2 \) into the original equation \( |n + 6| = 2 - n \) and check if both sides are equal.
"1. First, calculate the left-hand side:"
\[
|n + 6| = |-2 + 6| = |4| = 4
\]
"2. Now, calculate the right-hand side:"
\[
2 - n = 2 - (-2) = 2 + 2 = 4
\]
Now we compare both sides:
Left-hand side: \( 4 \)  
Right-hand side: \( 4 \)
"Since both sides are equal, this confirms that our solution \( n = -2 \) is indeed correct."
Thank you for guiding me through the process! Is there anything else you would like to discuss regarding this problem?
"Teacher: Excellent work double-checking your solution! You've clearly shown that when n = -2, both sides of the original equation |n + 6| = 2 – n equal 4, confirming that this is the only valid solution. "
To summarize our process:
"1. We first determined that 2 – n must be nonnegative, which gave us n ≤ 2."
"2. Then, we considered two cases for the absolute value."
"  • Case 1 (n + 6 ≥ 0): The equation became n + 6 = 2 – n, leading to n = -2, which satisfies the condition."
"  • Case 2 (n + 6 < 0): The equation led to an impossible equality, so there were no valid solutions."
"3. Finally, we substituted n = -2 back into the equation to confirm the solution."
The final answer is n = -2$
