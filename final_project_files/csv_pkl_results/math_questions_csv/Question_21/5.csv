Question: Solve for $n$: $|n + 6| = 2 - n$.
"Teacher: Let’s start by breaking down the problem into steps. We have the equation |n + 6| = 2 – n, and one important thing to notice is that the absolute value on the left-hand side is always non-negative. Therefore, the expression on the right-hand side, 2 – n, must also be non-negative for any solution to be valid."
Step 1: Determine the domain restriction by setting up the inequality that ensures 2 – n is non-negative. Could you work on establishing that inequality and solve for n?
"Student: Sure! To ensure that \(2 - n\) is non-negative, we need to set up the inequality:"
\[
2 - n \geq 0
\]
"Now, let's solve for \(n\):"
\[
-n \geq -2
\]
Multiplying both sides by -1 (and remembering to flip the inequality sign):
\[
n \leq 2
\]
"So, the domain restriction is that \(n\) must be less than or equal to \(2\). What should we do next?"
Teacher: Great job! Your work on determining the domain was accurate. You correctly set up 2 – n ≥ 0 and solved it to get n ≤ 2.
"Now, let's move on to the next step. Given the equation |n + 6| = 2 – n, remember that the absolute value expression |n + 6| can be split into two cases based on the sign of (n + 6)."
Step 2: Write the two cases for the equation:
a. One case where (n + 6) is non-negative (n + 6 ≥ 0).
b. Another case where (n + 6) is negative (n + 6 < 0).
"Could you set up the two corresponding equations for these cases? Please try this step, and then share your work."
Student: Sure! Let's break it down into the two cases based on the sign of \(n + 6\).
**Case 1:** When \(n + 6 \geq 0\) (which means \(n \geq -6\)):
"In this case, the absolute value expression can be simplified to:"
\[
|n + 6| = n + 6
\]
"So, the equation becomes:"
\[
n + 6 = 2 - n
\]
**Case 2:** When \(n + 6 < 0\) (which means \(n < -6\)):
"In this case, the absolute value expression can be simplified to:"
\[
|n + 6| = -(n + 6) = -n - 6
\]
"So, the equation becomes:"
\[
-n - 6 = 2 - n
\]
Now we have the two cases set up. What would you like me to do next?
"Teacher: Great job setting up the two cases! Now, let’s move on to Step 3."
Step 3 (Case 1): Solve the equation you set up for Case 1:
  n + 6 = 2 − n
"Work on solving this equation for n, and be sure to consider the domain restriction (n ≤ 2) along with the case condition (n + 6 ≥ 0 or n ≥ –6). What do you obtain for n in this case?"
Student: Sure! Let's solve the equation from Case 1:
**Case 1:** We have the equation:
\[
n + 6 = 2 - n
\]
"Now, let's isolate \(n\). First, we can add \(n\) to both sides:"
\[
n + n + 6 = 2
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2n + 6 = 2
\]
"Next, we subtract \(6\) from both sides:"
\[
2n = 2 - 6
\]
\[
2n = -4
\]
"Now, divide both sides by \(2\):"
\[
n = -2
\]
"Now, we need to check if this solution satisfies both the case condition \(n \geq -6\) and the domain restriction \(n \leq 2\)."
1. **Check case condition:** 
   \(-2 \geq -6\) is true.
2. **Check domain restriction:** 
   \(-2 \leq 2\) is also true.
"Since \(n = -2\) satisfies both conditions, it is a valid solution for Case 1."
What should we do next?
"Teacher: Great work on Case 1! Now, let's move on to Case 2."
"Remember, Case 2 is based on the condition n + 6 < 0 (i.e., n < -6). In this case, you set up the equation as:"
  -n - 6 = 2 - n
"Please solve this equation for n, simplify it, and check whether any found solution (if any) satisfies the case condition (n < -6) and the domain restriction (n ≤ 2). What do you obtain for n in this case?"
Student: Sure! Let's solve the equation from Case 2:
**Case 2:** The equation we have is:
\[
-n - 6 = 2 - n
\]
"To solve for \(n\), we can first add \(n\) to both sides:"
\[
-n + n - 6 = 2 - n + n
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-6 = 2
\]
"This is a contradiction, meaning that there are no solutions for Case 2. "
"Now, let's check if this aligns with our case condition and domain restriction:"
"- The case condition was \(n < -6\), and since we found a contradiction, there are no values of \(n\) that satisfy this case."
"- The domain restriction \(n \leq 2\) is still valid, but we need to focus on the solutions we found."
"So, the only valid solution we have comes from Case 1, which is \(n = -2\). "
What should I do next?
"Teacher: Excellent work on analyzing both cases! We found that Case 1 gives us n = -2, which satisfies the case condition (n ≥ -6) and the domain restriction (n ≤ 2). In Case 2, solving the equation led to a contradiction, meaning there are no solutions from that branch."
"Now, to summarize:"
"1. We determined the domain restriction by requiring 2 – n ≥ 0, leading to n ≤ 2."
2. We set up the two cases for the absolute value: 
"  a. For n + 6 ≥ 0, we solved n + 6 = 2 − n, which gave n = -2."
"  b. For n + 6 < 0, we solved -n - 6 = 2 - n, which resulted in a contradiction."
3. We confirmed that n = -2 satisfies n ≤ 2 and n ≥ -6.
Well done! The final solution to the equation |n + 6| = 2 – n is:
-2$
