Question: Solve for $n$: $|n + 6| = 2 - n$.
"3o-mini: To solve the equation |n + 6| = 2 - n, follow these steps:"
"1. Recognize that the absolute value |n + 6| is always nonnegative. Thus, for the equation to have any solutions, the right side must also be nonnegative:"
  2 - n ≥ 0 ⟹ n ≤ 2.
"2. Next, consider two cases based on the definition of absolute value."
"Case 1: When n + 6 is nonnegative (n + 6 ≥ 0, which means n ≥ -6)"
"  • In this case, |n + 6| = n + 6."
  • The equation becomes:
   n + 6 = 2 - n.
  • Add n to both sides:
   2n + 6 = 2.
  • Subtract 6 from both sides:
   2n = -4.
  • Divide by 2:
   n = -2.
"  • Check conditions: -2 is both ≤ 2 and ≥ -6, so n = -2 is valid."
"Case 2: When n + 6 is negative (n + 6 < 0, which means n < -6)"
"  • Here, |n + 6| = -(n + 6) = -n - 6."
  • The equation becomes:
   -n - 6 = 2 - n.
  • Add n to both sides:
   -6 = 2.
"  • This is a contradiction, so there are no solutions in this case."
"Thus, the only solution is n = -2."
