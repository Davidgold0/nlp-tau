Question: Solve for $n$: $|n + 6| = 2 - n$.
"3o-mini: We start with the equation |n + 6| = 2 − n. Since the absolute value is always nonnegative, the right side must also be nonnegative:"
  2 − n ≥ 0  ⇒  n ≤ 2.
"Next, we consider the two cases for the absolute value."
Case 1: n + 6 ≥ 0
"  Here, |n + 6| = n + 6. So the equation becomes:"
   n + 6 = 2 − n.
  Solve for n:
   n + n = 2 − 6
   2n = −4
   n = −2.
  We check the condition:
   n + 6 = −2 + 6 = 4 ≥ 0 and n = −2 ≤ 2. Both conditions hold.
Case 2: n + 6 < 0
"  In this case, |n + 6| = −(n + 6) = −n − 6. The equation becomes:"
   −n − 6 = 2 − n.
"  If we add n to both sides, we get:"
"   −6 = 2,"
"  which is a contradiction. Hence, there is no solution in this case."
"Thus, the only solution is n = −2."
