Question: How many different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47?
"Teacher: Let's begin by understanding what the problem is asking. We need to find all counting numbers (divisors) such that when we divide 47 by one of these numbers, the remainder is 5."
"A good first step is to express this situation using the division algorithm. In general, if a number d divides 47 leaving a remainder of 5, then we can write:"
  47 = q·d + 5    (for some integer q)
Rearrange this equation to see how d relates to 47 and the remainder. What would that rearranged equation be? Please solve for d by isolating the term involving d.
"Student: To rearrange the equation \( 47 = q \cdot d + 5 \) in order to isolate \( d \), we can start by subtracting 5 from both sides:"
\[
47 - 5 = q \cdot d
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
42 = q \cdot d
\]
"Next, we can express \( d \) in terms of \( q \):"
\[
d = \frac{42}{q}
\]
Now we have an expression for \( d \) in terms of \( q \). The next step is to determine the possible values of \( q \) that would result in \( d \) being a counting number (a positive integer). What do you think we should do next?
"Teacher: Great job on isolating d and finding that d = 42/q! Now, the next step is to use this equation to figure out what possible values d can take."
"Remember, because d is the divisor in our original division (47 = q·d + 5), there’s an important condition: the remainder 5 must be less than the divisor d. So we must have d > 5."
"Given that 42 = q·d, d must be a positive divisor of 42. Now, can you list all the positive divisors of 42 that are greater than 5? Please take your time to determine the correct values for d."
"Student: To find the positive divisors of 42, we can start by listing all the divisors. The positive divisors of 42 are:"
1. 1
2. 2
3. 3
4. 6
5. 7
6. 14
7. 21
8. 42
"Now, we need to identify which of these divisors are greater than 5. From the list, the divisors greater than 5 are:"
1. 6
2. 7
3. 14
4. 21
5. 42
"So, the positive divisors of 42 that are greater than 5 are 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. "
"Next, we can conclude that these are the different counting numbers that will each leave a remainder of 5 when 47 is divided by them. Would you like me to summarize the final answer?"
"Teacher: Great work listing the divisors of 42 and filtering out those that are greater than 5! You've identified the numbers 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. "
"Before we summarize our complete final answer, let's verify briefly: In our original problem, we needed counting numbers d such that, when 47 is divided by d, the remainder is 5. For that to hold, not only do we have d = 42/q (with d a divisor of 42), but we also have the condition d > 5. Your list matches these requirements."
"Now, can you please provide a final summary stating explicitly how many such counting numbers there are and what they are? Please make sure to include both the count and the list of numbers."
"Student: Sure! After analyzing the problem and identifying the positive divisors of 42 that are greater than 5, we found the following counting numbers:"
1. 6
2. 7
3. 14
4. 21
5. 42
"In total, there are **5 different counting numbers** that will each leave a remainder of 5 when 47 is divided by them. "
"So, to summarize: the counting numbers are 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42, and there are 5 such numbers."
"Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly determined that the counting numbers are 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42, making a total of 5 numbers. "
The final answer is 5$
