Question: How many different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47?
"Teacher: Let's break down the problem step by step. First, let’s rephrase the question in our own words:"
"We want to find how many counting numbers have the property that when 47 is divided by one of those numbers, the remainder is 5."
"Now, we can start by expressing what this condition means mathematically. What equation can you write to represent the statement “when 47 is divided by a counting number n, the remainder is 5”? Please share your equation and explain briefly how this relates to 47 and n."
"Student: Sure! To express the condition mathematically, we can use the concept of division with a remainder. When we say that 47 leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by a counting number \( n \), we can write this as:"
\[ 47 = kn + 5 \]
where \( k \) is some integer (the quotient). Rearranging this gives us:
\[ 47 - 5 = kn \]
\[ 42 = kn \]
"This means that \( n \) must be a divisor of 42. Additionally, since we want the remainder to be 5, \( n \) must be greater than 5. "
"Now, can you help me identify the divisors of 42?"
Teacher: Great job on setting up the equation and finding that 42 = n·k! Now we need to find the divisors of 42.
"Step 2: List all the counting numbers that divide 42 exactly, then remember our condition that n must be greater than 5."
Please list the divisors of 42 and indicate which ones are greater than 5. What do you get?
Student: Sure! Let's list all the divisors of 42. The divisors of 42 are:
"1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42."
"Now, we need to identify which of these divisors are greater than 5. The divisors greater than 5 are:"
"6, 7, 14, 21, and 42."
"So, the counting numbers that leave a remainder of 5 when 47 is divided by them are 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. "
"Now, how many different counting numbers did we find?"
"Teacher: Good work! You've correctly listed the divisors of 42 and identified those that are greater than 5—namely, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42."
"Now, looking at the list, how many different counting numbers did you find that satisfy the condition? Please tell me your final count."
"Student: Student: Thank you! From the list we identified, the counting numbers that leave a remainder of 5 when 47 is divided by them are 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. "
"Counting these, we have:"
1. 6
2. 7
3. 14
4. 21
5. 42
This gives us a total of 5 different counting numbers. 
"So, the final answer is that there are **5 different counting numbers** that leave a remainder of 5 when 47 is divided by them."
"Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly deduced that when 47 is divided by a number n leaving a remainder of 5, we can express it as 47 = kn + 5, which rearranges to 42 = kn. This tells us that n must be a divisor of 42. You then listed the divisors of 42 as 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42, and correctly noted that n must be greater than 5 (since the remainder, 5, is less than n). That left you with the divisors 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. Counting these gives us 5 numbers."
Your reasoning and calculations throughout the process are spot on.
