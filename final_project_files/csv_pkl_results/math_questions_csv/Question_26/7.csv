Question: How many different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47?
"3o-mini: Let d be a counting number (a positive integer) that leaves a remainder of 5 when 47 is divided by d. According to the division algorithm, there exists an integer quotient q such that"
  47 = d × q + 5.
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives
  42 = d × q.
This means that d must be a divisor of 42. The positive divisors of 42 are:
"  1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42."
"However, since the remainder (5) must be less than the divisor d, it must be that d > 5. Removing all divisors that are not greater than 5 leaves us with:"
"  6, 7, 14, 21, 42."
There are exactly 5 such numbers. 
"Therefore, 5 different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when 47 is divided by them."
