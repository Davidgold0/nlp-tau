Question: How many different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47?
Teacher: Great! Let’s work through the problem step by step.
"First, let’s rephrase the problem in our own words: We need to find how many counting numbers d have the property that when 47 is divided by d, the remainder is 5."
"To start, recall the division algorithm, which tells us that if a number is divided by d and leaves a remainder of 5, we can write it as:"
"  47 = d × q + 5,"
where q is the quotient.
"Now, subtract 5 from both sides to see the connection with d:"
"  47 – 5 = d × q,"
which simplifies to:
  42 = d × q.
"This tells us that d must be a divisor (a factor) of 42. Also, because the remainder (5) is less than the divisor, we know that d must be greater than 5."
"For our first step, please explain how you set up the equation for the division and show how you deduced that d divides 42. What does this tell you about the relationship between d and 42?"
Student: Sure! Let's break it down step by step.
"To set up the equation for the division, we used the division algorithm, which states that when dividing a number (in this case, 47) by another number (d), we can express it as:"
\[ 47 = d \times q + r \]
"where \( r \) is the remainder. In our problem, we know the remainder \( r \) is 5. So we can rewrite it as:"
\[ 47 = d \times q + 5 \]
"Next, to isolate the term involving \( d \), we subtract 5 from both sides:"
\[ 47 - 5 = d \times q \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 42 = d \times q \]
"From this equation, we can see that \( d \) must be a divisor of 42. This is because if \( 42 \) is equal to \( d \) times some integer \( q \), then \( d \) divides \( 42 \) evenly."
"Additionally, since we have a remainder of 5 when dividing by \( d \), it follows that \( d \) must be greater than 5. If \( d \) were less than or equal to 5, the remainder would not be valid (it cannot be greater than or equal to the divisor)."
"So, to summarize:"
"1. We derived the equation \( 42 = d \times q \), indicating that \( d \) divides 42."
2. \( d \) must be greater than 5 because the remainder is 5.
This relationship tells us that we need to find the divisors of 42 that are greater than 5. 
Would you like me to find the divisors of 42 next?
"Teacher: Great explanation! You've clearly set up the equation and deduced that d divides 42, and that d must be greater than 5. Now, for the next step, please list all the divisors of 42 and then identify which of those divisors are greater than 5. What divisors of 42 do you obtain?"
"Student: Sure! Let's start by finding all the divisors of 42. To do this, we can list the pairs of numbers that multiply together to give us 42."
The factors of 42 are:
- 1 and 42
- 2 and 21
- 3 and 14
- 6 and 7
"So, the complete list of divisors of 42 is:"
"1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42."
"Now, we need to identify which of these divisors are greater than 5. From our list, the divisors greater than 5 are:"
"6, 7, 14, 21, and 42."
To summarize:
"The divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. The divisors that are greater than 5 are 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42."
Is there anything else you would like me to do with this information?
"Teacher: Great work! You correctly listed the divisors of 42 and identified those greater than 5: 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42."
"Now, for the next step, please count how many divisors you have from your list that are greater than 5. What is the total number?"
"Student: Sure! From the list of divisors greater than 5, we have:"
- 6
- 7
- 14
- 21
- 42
"Now, let's count them:"
1. 6
2. 7
3. 14
4. 21
5. 42
There are a total of 5 divisors of 42 that are greater than 5.
"So, the total number of different counting numbers \( d \) that will leave a remainder of 5 when 47 is divided by \( d \) is **5**. "
Is there anything else you would like to discuss or clarify?
Teacher: You've done a great job arriving at the conclusion step by step. To summarize what we've done:
1. We set up the equation 47 = d × q + 5 and rewrote it as 42 = d × q.
2. This told us that d must be a divisor of 42.
"3. We then listed all the divisors of 42 and identified those that are greater than 5: 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42."
"4. Finally, we counted these divisors and found a total of 5 numbers that satisfy the condition."
Your final answer is: 5$
