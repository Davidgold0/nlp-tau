Question: How many different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47?
"3o-mini: To solve the problem, note that if a counting number d, when dividing 47, leaves a remainder of 5, the division algorithm tells us that"
  47 = q·d + 5      (1)
"where q is a nonnegative integer (the quotient) and the remainder (5) must satisfy 0 ≤ 5 < d, implying that d > 5."
Subtract 5 from both sides of equation (1):
  47 − 5 = q·d  
  42 = q·d
"This shows that d must be a divisor of 42, with the corresponding quotient q = 42/d being an integer."
List the divisors of 42:
"  1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42"
"Since d > 5, we discard divisors less than or equal to 5. The remaining possible divisors are:"
"  6, 7, 14, 21, and 42"
"Thus, there are 5 counting numbers that leave a remainder of 5 when dividing 47."
