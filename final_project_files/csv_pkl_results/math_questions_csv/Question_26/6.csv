Question: How many different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47?
"3o-mini: We start with the division algorithm which states that if a divisor d leaves a remainder of 5 when dividing 47, then"
  47 = q × d + 5
where q is an integer quotient. Rearranging gives:
  47 - 5 = q × d ⟹ 42 = q × d
This tells us that d must be a factor of 42. The positive factors (counting numbers) of 42 are:
"  1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42"
"However, there is an additional condition from the division algorithm that the remainder must be less than the divisor. Since the remainder is 5, we must have:"
  d > 5
"Discarding the factors that are not greater than 5, we are left with:"
"  6, 7, 14, 21, 42"
"Thus, there are 5 counting numbers that will leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47."
