"Question: If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2, then what is the degree of polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$?"
Teacher: Let's start by outlining the steps we need to follow in order to solve the problem:
1. Restate the problem in your own words: We are given f(x) as a degree 4 polynomial and g(x) as a degree 2 polynomial. We need to figure out what happens to the degree when we subtract g(x) from f(x).
2. Recall the definition: The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of x that appears with a nonzero coefficient.
"3. Identify the highest power terms in each polynomial: Since f(x) is degree 4, its highest term is something like ax^4 (with a ≠ 0), and since g(x) is degree 2, its highest term is something like bx^2 (with b ≠ 0)."
4. Consider the subtraction f(x) - g(x): Think about how the highest degree term in f(x) might be affected by subtracting g(x) and what that means for the overall degree.
"Now, let’s start with step 1:"
Could you please explain what the definition of the degree of a polynomial is and how it applies to f(x) and g(x) in this problem?
Student: Sure! The degree of a polynomial is defined as the highest power of the variable \( x \) that appears in the polynomial with a nonzero coefficient. 
"In this problem, we have two polynomials: "
"- \( f(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 4, which means its highest degree term can be represented as \( ax^4 \) (where \( a \neq 0 \))."
"- \( g(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 2, so its highest degree term can be represented as \( bx^2 \) (where \( b \neq 0 \))."
"This means that \( f(x) \) will have terms up to \( x^4 \), and \( g(x) \) will have terms up to \( x^2 \). "
"Now, I can see how this definition applies: when we subtract \( g(x) \) from \( f(x) \), the highest degree term in \( f(x) \) (which is \( ax^4 \)) will still be present, since \( g(x) \) does not have any terms of degree 4 to affect it. "
"So, the degree of the polynomial \( f(x) - g(x) \) will still be determined by the highest degree term from \( f(x) \). "
Does this explanation align with your expectations?
"Teacher: Great explanation! You clearly stated that the degree of a polynomial is the highest power of x with a nonzero coefficient, and you correctly identified the leading terms for f(x) and g(x). Now, let's move to the next step."
"Step 2: Considering that f(x) is degree 4 with a leading term having x⁴ and g(x) is degree 2 with no x⁴ term, what is the degree of f(x) - g(x)? Please explain your reasoning for this step before we move further."
"Student: Student: Thank you! Since we know that \( f(x) \) has a leading term of \( ax^4 \) and \( g(x) \) has a leading term of \( bx^2 \), when we subtract \( g(x) \) from \( f(x) \), we can express this as:"
\[
f(x) - g(x) = (ax^4 + \text{(lower degree terms)}) - (bx^2 + \text{(lower degree terms)})
\]
"The highest degree term in \( f(x) \) is \( ax^4 \), which is of degree 4. The highest degree term in \( g(x) \) is \( bx^2 \), which is of degree 2. "
"When we perform the subtraction, the \( ax^4 \) term remains unchanged because there is no corresponding \( x^4 \) term in \( g(x) \) to subtract from it. Thus, the highest degree term in the resulting polynomial \( f(x) - g(x) \) will still be \( ax^4 \)."
"Since the leading term \( ax^4 \) dominates and is of degree 4, the degree of the polynomial \( f(x) - g(x) \) will also be 4. "
"So, to conclude, the degree of \( f(x) - g(x) \) is 4. Does this reasoning make sense?"
"Teacher: Excellent work! Your reasoning is spot on. Since f(x) has a term ax⁴ and g(x) has no x⁴ term, subtracting g(x) from f(x) does not affect the degree-4 term. Therefore, we have confirmed that the degree of f(x) - g(x) is determined by that highest degree term from f(x)."
"Now, could you please provide your final answer for the degree of f(x) - g(x)?"
"Student: The degree of the polynomial \( f(x) - g(x) \) is 4. This is because the highest degree term in \( f(x) \) is \( ax^4 \), which remains unchanged when subtracting \( g(x) \) since \( g(x) \) does not have any term of degree 4. Thus, the overall degree of the resulting polynomial is determined by this term."
"Teacher: Fantastic work! Your explanation was clear and thorough—you identified that the highest term in f(x), ax⁴, remains unaffected since g(x) has no term of degree 4. This reasoning correctly leads to the conclusion that the degree of f(x) - g(x) is determined by the ax⁴ term."
To summarize:
1. You recalled that the degree of a polynomial is the highest power of x with a nonzero coefficient.
2. You identified that f(x) has a leading term of ax⁴ (degree 4) and g(x) has a leading term of bx² (degree 2).
3. You correctly noted that subtracting g(x) from f(x) leaves the ax⁴ term unchanged.
"4. Thus, the final answer is that the degree of f(x) - g(x) is 4."
Your final answer is: 4$
