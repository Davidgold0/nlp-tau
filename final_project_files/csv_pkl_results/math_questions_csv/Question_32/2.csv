"Question: If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2, then what is the degree of polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$?"
Teacher: Let's begin by outlining the steps needed to solve the problem:
"1. Write down the general forms for f(x) and g(x), focusing especially on their highest-degree terms."
2. Identify the highest-degree term in f(x) and g(x).
"3. Consider what happens when you subtract g(x) from f(x) — specifically, which terms might cancel and which do not."
4. Decide what the degree of f(x) - g(x) will be based on the above points.
"Now, for the first step, please write the general form for f(x) as a degree-4 polynomial and for g(x) as a degree-2 polynomial, emphasizing their leading terms. Once you have that, please share what you wrote, and we’ll check that part together."
Student: Sure! 
"For the polynomial \( f(x) \) of degree 4, the general form can be written as:  "
\[ f(x) = ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e \]  
where \( a \neq 0 \) (since \( a \) is the coefficient of the highest degree term).
"For the polynomial \( g(x) \) of degree 2, the general form can be written as:  "
\[ g(x) = mx^2 + nx + p \]  
where \( m \neq 0 \).
"The leading term of \( f(x) \) is \( ax^4 \), and the leading term of \( g(x) \) is \( mx^2 \)."
What do you think about this?
Teacher: Your work so far looks great! You've correctly written the general forms and identified the leading terms of f(x) and g(x). 
"Now, for the next step, please explain what happens when you subtract g(x) from f(x) term by term. In particular, focus on the highest-degree term: what happens to the ax⁴ term from f(x)? Does any term from g(x) affect it, or is it preserved? Please work through that step and share your reasoning."
Student: Thank you for your feedback! 
"When we subtract \( g(x) \) from \( f(x) \), we can write it as:"
\[
f(x) - g(x) = (ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e) - (mx^2 + nx + p)
\]
"Now, let's look at the terms individually:"
1. The highest-degree term from \( f(x) \) is \( ax^4 \).
2. The highest-degree term from \( g(x) \) is \( mx^2 \).
"When we subtract \( g(x) \) from \( f(x) \), the \( ax^4 \) term remains unaffected because there is no \( x^4 \) term in \( g(x) \) to cancel it out. Therefore, the leading term \( ax^4 \) remains in the polynomial \( f(x) - g(x) \)."
"The other terms will combine, but since \( ax^4 \) is the highest degree term and is not canceled, it will determine the degree of the resulting polynomial."
"Based on this, the degree of \( f(x) - g(x) \) remains 4, as the leading term \( ax^4 \) is preserved. "
Does this reasoning align with what you were expecting?
"Teacher: Excellent work! Your reasoning is correct so far. You’ve shown that when subtracting g(x) from f(x), the leading term ax⁴ in f(x) remains unchanged because there is no corresponding x⁴ term in g(x) to cancel it out. "
"Now, for the next step, please state the final degree of the polynomial f(x) – g(x) along with a brief explanation summarizing why it has that degree. What is your final conclusion?"
Student: Thank you for your guidance! 
The final degree of the polynomial \( f(x) - g(x) \) is 4. 
"This is because the leading term \( ax^4 \) from \( f(x) \) remains unaffected when we subtract \( g(x) \), as there is no \( x^4 \) term in \( g(x) \) to cancel it out. Since the highest degree term in the resulting polynomial is \( ax^4 \), the degree of \( f(x) - g(x) \) is determined by this term, which is 4."
"In summary, the degree of the polynomial \( f(x) - g(x) \) is 4 because the highest degree term \( ax^4 \) from \( f(x) \) remains intact after the subtraction."
"Teacher: Great job throughout this process! You've correctly identified the forms of f(x) and g(x), analyzed the subtraction, and concluded that the leading term ax⁴ remains unaffected. Therefore, the highest degree in f(x) – g(x) is 4."
Your final answer is: 4$
