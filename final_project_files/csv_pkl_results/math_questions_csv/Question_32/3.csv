"Question: If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2, then what is the degree of polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$?"
"Teacher: Let's begin by rephrasing the problem in our own words: We have two polynomials, f(x) and g(x). f(x) has degree 4, and g(x) has degree 2. We need to find the degree of the polynomial that results from f(x) – g(x). "
A good plan to approach this problem could be:
1. Identify what the degree of a polynomial means and confirm the degrees of f(x) and g(x).
2. Consider how subtracting a polynomial (g(x)) from another polynomial (f(x)) might affect the leading term—the term that determines the degree.
3. Analyze whether subtracting a lower degree polynomial could ever change the highest degree term of the higher degree polynomial.
4. Use this analysis to conclude the degree of f(x) – g(x).
"Let’s start with step 1: What does it mean for f(x) to be a polynomial of degree 4, and for g(x) to be a polynomial of degree 2? Please share your explanation for this step."
Student: Sure! 
"A polynomial of degree 4, like \( f(x) \), means that the highest power of \( x \) in \( f(x) \) is 4. This means that \( f(x) \) can be expressed in the form:"
\[
f(x) = a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0
\]
where \( a_4 \neq 0 \). The term \( a_4 x^4 \) is the leading term and determines the degree of the polynomial.
"On the other hand, a polynomial of degree 2, like \( g(x) \), has its highest power of \( x \) equal to 2. It can be expressed as:"
\[
g(x) = b_2 x^2 + b_1 x + b_0
\]
where \( b_2 \neq 0 \). The leading term here is \( b_2 x^2 \).
"So, in summary, \( f(x) \) has a leading term of degree 4, while \( g(x) \) has a leading term of degree 2. "
Does this explanation align with your understanding?
Teacher: Great job! You've clearly explained what it means for a polynomial to have a certain degree and identified the leading terms for both f(x) and g(x).
"Now, let's move to step 2: Consider how subtracting g(x) from f(x) could affect the leading term—the term of highest degree."
What do you think happens to the leading term of f(x) when we subtract g(x) from it? Please share your thoughts on this specific step.
Student: Student: Thank you! 
"When we subtract \( g(x) \) from \( f(x) \), we are looking at the expression \( f(x) - g(x) \). Since \( f(x) \) has a leading term of \( a_4 x^4 \) and \( g(x) \) has a leading term of \( b_2 x^2 \), the leading term of \( g(x) \) is of a lower degree than that of \( f(x) \)."
"When we perform the subtraction, the leading term of \( f(x) \), which is \( a_4 x^4 \), remains unchanged because we are subtracting a term of lower degree. Specifically, the \( b_2 x^2 \) term does not affect the highest degree term of \( f(x) \). "
"Therefore, the leading term of \( f(x) - g(x) \) will still be \( a_4 x^4 \), and since \( a_4 \neq 0 \), the degree of the resulting polynomial \( f(x) - g(x) \) will still be 4."
Does this reasoning make sense?
Teacher: Excellent work! Your explanation is clear and accurate. You've correctly identified that subtracting g(x) from f(x) does not affect the leading term of f(x) since g(x)'s highest degree is lower. 
"For our next step, please summarize your reasoning and then state what the degree of f(x) − g(x) is. Go ahead and share your conclusion for this step."
Student: Sure! 
To summarize my reasoning:
"1. We have two polynomials: \( f(x) \) of degree 4, which has a leading term of \( a_4 x^4 \), and \( g(x) \) of degree 2, which has a leading term of \( b_2 x^2 \)."
"2. When we subtract \( g(x) \) from \( f(x) \), the leading term of \( f(x) \) remains unchanged because the leading term of \( g(x) \) is of lower degree."
"3. Therefore, the leading term of the resulting polynomial \( f(x) - g(x) \) is still \( a_4 x^4 \), and since \( a_4 \neq 0 \), the degree of the polynomial \( f(x) - g(x) \) remains 4."
"In conclusion, the degree of the polynomial \( f(x) - g(x) \) is 4. "
Does this conclusion align with your expectations?
"Teacher: Great job summarizing your reasoning! Your explanation is clear and accurate. You've correctly identified that subtracting g(x) from f(x) does not affect the leading term since g(x)'s highest power (x²) is lower than f(x)'s highest power (x⁴). Therefore, the degree of f(x) − g(x) remains 4."
"With your explanation complete and your reasoning solid, the final answer is 4$"
