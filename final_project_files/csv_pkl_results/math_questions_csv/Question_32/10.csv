"Question: If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2, then what is the degree of polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$?"
"3o-mini: Since f(x) is a degree 4 polynomial and g(x) is a degree 2 polynomial, the highest degree term in f(x) (which is of degree 4) won't cancel with any term in g(x) (since g(x) has no term of degree 4). Therefore, when you compute f(x) - g(x), the leading term from f(x) remains and the resulting polynomial is also of degree 4."
"So, the degree of f(x) - g(x) is 4."
