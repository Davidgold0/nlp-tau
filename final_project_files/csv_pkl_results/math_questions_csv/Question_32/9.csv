"Question: If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2, then what is the degree of polynomial $f(x) - g(x)$?"
"3o-mini: The degree of a polynomial is determined by its highest power with a nonzero coefficient. Since f(x) is a polynomial of degree 4, its highest term is of the form ax⁴ where a ≠ 0. When subtracting g(x), a polynomial of degree 2, from f(x), the highest degree term (ax⁴) in f(x) remains unchanged because g(x) does not have any term of degree 4 to cancel it out. Therefore, the degree of f(x) - g(x) is 4."
