Question: The operation $\clubsuit$ is defined by $x\clubsuit y =|x|^3+y$. What is the value of $2\clubsuit 4$?
"Teacher: Let's break down the problem into manageable steps together. The operation is defined as x clubsuit y = |x|続 + y. So, when asked for 2 clubsuit 4, we need to follow these steps:"
Step 1: Substitute x = 2 and y = 4 into the definition.
"Step 2: Calculate the absolute value of x, which is |2|."
Step 3: Cube the result from Step 2 to get |2|続.
Step 4: Add y (which is 4) to the result from Step 3.
Let's start with the first step. What is the value of |2|? Please solve this next step only.
Student: The value of |2| is 2.
Teacher: That's correct! |2| is indeed 2.
Now let's move on to the next step: We need to cube the absolute value we found. Can you compute 2続 (2 cubed) next? Please solve this step only.
Student: Student: The value of \(2^3\) (2 cubed) is \(8\).
Teacher: Great job with calculating 2続 as 8! Now we move on to the final step: adding y (which is 4) to the result. Can you compute what 8 + 4 equals? Please work on this step only.
Student: Student: The value of \(8 + 4\) is \(12\).
Teacher: You've successfully worked through all the steps! Your final answer is 12$
