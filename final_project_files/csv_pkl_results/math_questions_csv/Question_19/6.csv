Question: The operation $\clubsuit$ is defined by $x\clubsuit y =|x|^3+y$. What is the value of $2\clubsuit 4$?
"3o-mini: We are given that x ♣ y = |x|³ + y. To compute 2 ♣ 4, substitute x = 2 and y = 4:"
1. Find the absolute value of x: |2| = 2.
2. Cube the result: 2³ = 8.
3. Add y: 8 + 4 = 12.
"Thus, 2 ♣ 4 = 12."
