Question: The operation $\clubsuit$ is defined by $x\clubsuit y =|x|^3+y$. What is the value of $2\clubsuit 4$?
Teacher: Let's begin by understanding the problem. The operation is defined as follows: 
x clubsuit y = |x|続 + y
We need to evaluate 2 clubsuit 4. 
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into these steps:"
1. Substitute x = 2 and y = 4 into the formula.
"2. Compute the absolute value of 2, which is |2|."
3. Cube the result from step 2.
"4. Finally, add 4 to the cubed result."
"Let's start with the first step: What is the absolute value of 2 (i.e., compute |2|)? Please provide your response for this step."
Student: The absolute value of 2 is |2| = 2.
"Teacher: Great job! The absolute value of 2 is indeed 2. Now, for the next step, we need to cube this absolute value. Can you calculate 2 cubed (2続) and share your reasoning?"
"Student: Student: Sure! To calculate \(2\) cubed, we multiply \(2\) by itself three times:"
\[
2^3 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 4 \times 2 = 8
\]
"So, \(2^3 = 8\)."
"Teacher: Excellent work calculating 2続 = 8. Now let's move to the next step: add the value of y, which is 4, to this cubed result. What is 8 + 4? Please explain your reasoning for this step."
"Student: Student: To find \(8 + 4\), we simply add the two numbers together. "
"Starting with \(8\), if we add \(4\) to it, we can think of it as:"
\[
8 + 4 = 12
\]
So the result of \(8 + 4\) is \(12\).
Teacher: You've done a wonderful job breaking down the problem! To summarize our steps:
1. We computed the absolute value: |2| = 2.
2. We cubed the result: 2続 = 8.
3. We added the given y value: 8 + 4 = 12.
"Thus, the final answer is 12$"
