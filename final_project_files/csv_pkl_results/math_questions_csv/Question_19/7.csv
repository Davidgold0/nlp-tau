Question: The operation $\clubsuit$ is defined by $x\clubsuit y =|x|^3+y$. What is the value of $2\clubsuit 4$?
3o-mini: We are given that x clubsuit y = |x|³ + y.
"To find 2 clubsuit 4, substitute x = 2 and y = 4 into the formula:"
  2 clubsuit 4 = |2|³ + 4 = 2³ + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12.
"Therefore, the value of 2 clubsuit 4 is 12."
