Question: The operation $\clubsuit$ is defined by $x\clubsuit y =|x|^3+y$. What is the value of $2\clubsuit 4$?
Teacher: Great! Let's break down the problem together.
The operation is defined as x clubsuit y = |x|³ + y. We need to find the value of 2 clubsuit 4. Here's how we can tackle this step-by-step:
Step 1: Evaluate the absolute value |2|.
Could you please calculate |2|?
Student: Sure! The absolute value of 2 is |2| = 2. 
What should we do next?
"Teacher: Great! Your first step was perfect. Now, moving on:"
"Step 2: Since we have |2| = 2 from Step 1, the next step is to cube this value. Could you please calculate 2³?"
Student: Student: Of course! The value of \(2^3\) is \(2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8\).
What should we do next?
Teacher: Great job on computing 2³ = 8!
"Step 3: Now, according to the definition of the operation x clubsuit y = |x|³ + y, we need to add the second number (which is 4) to the cube you just calculated. Could you please perform this addition (8 + 4)?"
Student: Student: Sure! Adding 8 and 4 gives us \(8 + 4 = 12\).
"So, the value of \(2 \clubsuit 4\) is 12. Is that correct?"
Teacher: Excellent work! You correctly followed all the steps:
"• You began by finding the absolute value of 2, which is 2.  "
• Then you cubed that value to get 2³ = 8.  
"• Finally, you added 4 to 8, resulting in 12."
Your final answer is 12$
