Question: Compute_x000D_
\[\frac{\tan^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ}{\tan^2 20^\circ \sin^2 20^\circ}.\]
Teacher: Let's start by outlining a plan to tackle the problem. We're asked to compute:
            (tan²20° - sin²20°) / (tan²20° · sin²20°).
A good strategy might involve these steps:
1. Express tan²20° in terms of sin²20° and cos²20° (since tan θ = sin θ / cos θ).
2. Rewrite the expression using that identity.
3. Simplify the numerator by combining like terms.
"4. Simplify the denominator, and then the whole expression."
5. Reach the final simplified answer.
Let's begin with step 1: Can you rewrite tan²20° in terms of sin²20° and cos²20°? Please show how you would do that.
"Student: Sure! To express \(\tan^2 20^\circ\) in terms of \(\sin^2 20^\circ\) and \(\cos^2 20^\circ\), we can use the identity for tangent:"
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}.
\]
"Therefore, we have:"
\[
\tan^2 20^\circ = \left(\frac{\sin 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}.
\]
"So, \(\tan^2 20^\circ\) can be rewritten as:"
\[
\tan^2 20^\circ = \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}.
\]
Would you like me to proceed to step 2 and rewrite the expression using this identity?
Teacher: Great job! Your rewriting of tan²20° as sin²20°/cos²20° is absolutely correct.
"Now, for step 2, let's rewrite the entire expression using this identity. The original expression is:"
  (tan²20° – sin²20°) / (tan²20° · sin²20°).
Replace tan²20° with sin²20°/cos²20°. Can you show how the expression looks after this substitution? Please share your work for just this step.
"Student: Sure! After substituting \(\tan^2 20^\circ\) with \(\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}\), the expression becomes:"
\[
\frac{\left(\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} - \sin^2 20^\circ\right)}{\left(\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} \cdot \sin^2 20^\circ\right)}.
\]
"Now, let's simplify the numerator:"
\[
\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} - \sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}.
\]
So the expression now looks like:
\[
\frac{\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}}{\frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}}.
\]
Would you like me to proceed to the next step and simplify this expression further?
Teacher: Excellent work! You’ve correctly substituted tan²20° and simplified the numerator and denominator to get:
  [(sin²20° – sin²20°·cos²20°)⁄cos²20°] ÷ [sin⁴20°⁄cos²20°].
"Now, our next step is to simplify this complex fraction. Remember that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. Can you show how you would simplify this expression by applying that rule and canceling common factors? Please solve just this next step."
Student: Sure! To simplify the expression 
\[
"\frac{\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}}{\frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}},"
\]
we can multiply by the reciprocal of the denominator:
\[
= \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{\cos^2 20^\circ}{\sin^4 20^\circ}.
\]
"Now, notice that the \(\cos^2 20^\circ\) in the numerator and the denominator will cancel out:"
\[
= \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}{\sin^4 20^\circ}.
\]
"Next, we can factor out \(\sin^2 20^\circ\) from the numerator:"
\[
= \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ (1 - \cos^2 20^\circ)}{\sin^4 20^\circ}.
\]
"Since \(1 - \cos^2 20^\circ = \sin^2 20^\circ\) (by the Pythagorean identity), we can substitute that in:"
\[
= \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ \cdot \sin^2 20^\circ}{\sin^4 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\sin^4 20^\circ} = 1.
\]
"So, the simplified expression is:"
\[
1.
\]
Would you like to discuss this step further or move on to the final conclusion?
"Teacher: Great work! Your process was spot on: you rewrote tan²20° as sin²20°/cos²20°, substituted it into the expression, combined the fractions properly, and then canceled common factors. You then factored out sin²20° from the numerator and used the identity 1 – cos²20° = sin²20°, which led you to simplify the whole expression to 1."
Final answer: 
1$
