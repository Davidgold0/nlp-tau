Question: Compute_x000D_
\[\frac{\tan^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ}{\tan^2 20^\circ \sin^2 20^\circ}.\]
Teacher: Great! Let's begin by rephrasing the problem and breaking it down step by step.
We want to simplify the expression
  (tan²20° – sin²20°) / (tan²20° · sin²20°).
A useful first step is to express tan²20° in terms of sine and cosine. How could you rewrite tan²20° using sine and cosine? Please work on expressing tan²20° that way as the next step.
"Student: Sure! The tangent function can be expressed in terms of sine and cosine. Specifically, we know that:"
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}.
\]
"Therefore, when we square it, we have:"
\[
\tan^2 20^\circ = \left(\frac{\sin 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}.
\]
"Now, I can substitute this expression for \(\tan^2 20^\circ\) into the original expression. Would you like me to go ahead and do that?"
Teacher: Great job! You've successfully expressed tan²20° in terms of sine and cosine. The next step is to substitute your expression for tan²20° into the original expression:
  ( tan²20° – sin²20° ) / ( tan²20° · sin²20° )
"Remember, you found that tan²20° = sin²20°/cos²20°. Can you substitute this into both the numerator and denominator and simplify the expression accordingly? Please work on this substitution as the next step and share your work."
Student: Student: Sure! Let's substitute \(\tan^2 20^\circ = \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}\) into the original expression:
\[
\frac{\tan^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ}{\tan^2 20^\circ \sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{\left(\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}\right) - \sin^2 20^\circ}{\left(\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}\right) \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]
"Now, let's simplify the numerator:"
\[
\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} - \sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}.
\]
Factoring \(\sin^2 20^\circ\) out of the numerator gives us:
\[
\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ (1 - \cos^2 20^\circ)}{\cos^2 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}.
\]
"Now, let’s simplify the denominator:"
\[
\left(\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}\right) \sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}.
\]
"Putting it all together, we have:"
\[
\frac{\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}}{\frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 20^\circ}{\sin^4 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\sin^4 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]
So the final expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]
Would you like me to continue with this result or check for any errors?
Teacher: You've done an excellent job with your substitutions and simplifications so far. Let's review your work together step by step to ensure that the final division is done correctly.
Starting with your result:
  Numerator = sin²20°(1 - cos²20°)/cos²20°  
"  Since 1 - cos²20° = sin²20°, this becomes sin²20° · sin²20°/cos²20° = sin⁴20°/cos²20°."
  Denominator = (sin²20°/cos²20°) · sin²20° = sin⁴20°/cos²20°.
"Now, what do you get when you divide (sin⁴20°/cos²20°) by (sin⁴20°/cos²20°)? Please work on that division as the next step."
Student: Student: Thank you for the guidance! Let's divide the expressions as you suggested.
We have:
**Numerator:** \(\frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}\)
**Denominator:** \(\frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}\)
"When we divide the numerator by the denominator, we get:"
\[
\frac{\frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}}{\frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}} = 1.
\]
"So, the final result of the original expression is:"
\[
1.
\]
Is that correct?
Teacher: You've done a great job guiding all the steps and arriving at your result. Your division was perfectly handled: dividing (sin⁴20°/cos²20°) by (sin⁴20°/cos²20°) indeed gives 1.
Your final answer for the expression is:
1$
