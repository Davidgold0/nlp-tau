Question: Compute_x000D_
\[\frac{\tan^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ}{\tan^2 20^\circ \sin^2 20^\circ}.\]
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem. We have the expression
  ( tan²20° – sin²20° ) / ( tan²20° · sin²20° ).
"A good first step is to rewrite tan²20° in terms of sine and cosine. Recall that tan x = sin x/cos x, so what is tan²20° expressed in terms of sin20° and cos20°?"
Please solve this first step and tell me what tan²20° equals in terms of sine and cosine.
"Student: Sure! To express \(\tan^2 20^\circ\) in terms of sine and cosine, we can use the definition of tangent. We know that:"
\[
\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]
"So, squaring both sides gives us:"
\[
\tan^2 x = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos^2 x}
\]
"Applying this to \(20^\circ\), we have:"
\[
\tan^2 20^\circ = \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}
\]
Now we can substitute this back into our original expression. Would you like me to proceed with that?
Teacher: Great job! Your expression for tan²20° is perfectly correct.
"Now, for the next step, let’s substitute tan²20° = sin²20°/cos²20° back into our expression. That means the expression becomes:"
  [ (sin²20°/cos²20°) – sin²20° ] / [ (sin²20°/cos²20°) · sin²20° ].
The next step is to simplify the numerator. Could you work on rewriting the numerator in a simpler form? Please show your steps.
Student: Student: Sure! Let's simplify the numerator step by step. We have:
\[
\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} - \sin^2 20^\circ.
\]
"To combine these two terms, we can express \(\sin^2 20^\circ\) with a common denominator, which is \(\cos^2 20^\circ\). So, we rewrite \(\sin^2 20^\circ\) as:"
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ \cdot \cos^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}.
\]
"Now, substituting this into the numerator gives us:"
\[
\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} - \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ \cdot \cos^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin^2 20^\circ - \sin^2 20^\circ \cdot \cos^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}.
\]
Now we can factor out \(\sin^2 20^\circ\) from the numerator:
\[
\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ (1 - \cos^2 20^\circ)}{\cos^2 20^\circ}.
\]
"Since \(1 - \cos^2 20^\circ = \sin^2 20^\circ\) (using the Pythagorean identity), we can substitute that in:"
\[
\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ \cdot \sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}.
\]
Now we have simplified the numerator. Would you like me to proceed with the denominator next?
Teacher: Great job simplifying the numerator! You've correctly simplified it to (sin⁴20°)/(cos²20°).
"Now, let’s move on to the next part: the denominator, which is (tan²20° · sin²20°). Remember that we've already written tan²20° as (sin²20°)/(cos²20°). "
Could you please substitute that into the denominator and simplify it? Show your steps as you simplify the denominator.
Student: Sure! Let's simplify the denominator step by step. We have:
\[
\tan^2 20^\circ \cdot \sin^2 20^\circ.
\]
"Substituting \(\tan^2 20^\circ\) with \(\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}\), we get:"
\[
\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} \cdot \sin^2 20^\circ.
\]
"Now, we can multiply this out:"
\[
\frac{\sin^2 20^\circ \cdot \sin^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}.
\]
"So, the denominator simplifies to:"
\[
\frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}.
\]
Now we have both the numerator and the denominator simplified. Would you like me to combine them into the final expression?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly simplified the denominator to sin⁴20°/cos²20°. Now we have the following expression:
  [sin⁴20°/cos²20°] ÷ [sin⁴20°/cos²20°].
The next step is to combine these results by dividing the numerator by the denominator. Could you please complete this final step and simplify the overall expression?
Student: Sure! Now we have:
\[
\frac{\frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}}{\frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ}}.
\]
"When we divide the two fractions, we can simplify it as follows:"
\[
\frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} \div \frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin^4 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{\cos^2 20^\circ}{\sin^4 20^\circ}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\sin^4 20^\circ \cdot \cos^2 20^\circ}{\cos^2 20^\circ \cdot \sin^4 20^\circ} = 1.
\]
"So, the final simplified expression is:"
\[
1.
\]
Thank you for guiding me through the steps! I feel like I have a better understanding of how to simplify these types of expressions now.
Teacher: Wonderful work! You've correctly simplified the expression in each step. To summarize our process:
1. We began by expressing tan²20° as sin²20°/cos²20°.
"2. Then, we rewrote the numerator, combining the terms using a common denominator and applying the Pythagorean identity (1 – cos²20° = sin²20°) to obtain sin⁴20°/cos²20°."
"3. Next, we simplified the denominator by substituting tan²20° with sin²20°/cos²20° and multiplying to get sin⁴20°/cos²20°."
"4. Finally, dividing the numerator by the denominator led to a cancellation, leaving us with 1."
Your final answer is:
1$
