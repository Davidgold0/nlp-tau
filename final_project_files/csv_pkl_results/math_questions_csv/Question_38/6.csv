"Question: Wanda is trying to locate the Fermat point $P$ of $\triangle ABC$, where $A$ is at the origin, $B$ is at $(8,-1)$, and $C$ is at $(5,4)$ (the Fermat point is the point such that the sum of its distances from the vertices of a triangle is minimized). She guesses that the point is at $P = (4,2)$, and computes the sum of the distances from $P$ to the vertices of $\triangle ABC$. If she obtains $m + n\sqrt{5}$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers, what is $m + n$?_x000D_"

"3o-mini: We first compute the distance from P(4,2) to each vertex."
"Distance from P to A(0,0):"
  PA = √[(4−0)² + (2−0)²] = √(16 + 4) = √20 = 2√5.
"Distance from P to B(8,−1):"
  PB = √[(4−8)² + (2−(−1))²] = √[(−4)² + (3)²] = √(16 + 9) = √25 = 5.
"Distance from P to C(5,4):"
  PC = √[(4−5)² + (2−4)²] = √[(−1)² + (−2)²] = √(1 + 4) = √5.
The total distance is:
  PA + PB + PC = 2√5 + 5 + √5 = 5 + 3√5.
"This is of the form m + n√5 with m = 5 and n = 3, so m + n = 5 + 3 = 8."
