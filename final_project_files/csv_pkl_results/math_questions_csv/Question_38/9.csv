"Question: Wanda is trying to locate the Fermat point $P$ of $\triangle ABC$, where $A$ is at the origin, $B$ is at $(8,-1)$, and $C$ is at $(5,4)$ (the Fermat point is the point such that the sum of its distances from the vertices of a triangle is minimized). She guesses that the point is at $P = (4,2)$, and computes the sum of the distances from $P$ to the vertices of $\triangle ABC$. If she obtains $m + n\sqrt{5}$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers, what is $m + n$?_x000D_"

"3o-mini: We begin by finding the distances from P = (4,2) to the vertices of triangle ABC:"
"1. Distance from A(0,0) to P(4,2):"
  AP = √[(4 - 0)² + (2 - 0)²] = √(16 + 4) = √20 = 2√5.
"2. Distance from B(8, -1) to P(4,2):"
  BP = √[(8 - 4)² + ((-1) - 2)²] = √(4² + (-3)²) = √(16 + 9) = √25 = 5.
"3. Distance from C(5,4) to P(4,2):"
  CP = √[(5 - 4)² + (4 - 2)²] = √(1² + 2²) = √(1 + 4) = √5.
The sum of these distances is:
  2√5 + 5 + √5 = 5 + 3√5.
"Thus, with m = 5 and n = 3, we have m + n = 5 + 3 = 8."
