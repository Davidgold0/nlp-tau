"Question: Wanda is trying to locate the Fermat point $P$ of $\triangle ABC$, where $A$ is at the origin, $B$ is at $(8,-1)$, and $C$ is at $(5,4)$ (the Fermat point is the point such that the sum of its distances from the vertices of a triangle is minimized). She guesses that the point is at $P = (4,2)$, and computes the sum of the distances from $P$ to the vertices of $\triangle ABC$.

Teacher: Let's start by rephrasing the problem in our own words and planning our steps.
"We have a triangle with vertices A(0,0), B(8,–1), and C(5,4). Wanda guesses the Fermat point is at P(4,2), and she calculates the sum of the distances from P to the three vertices. The sum turns out to have the form m + n√5, where m and n are integers. Our goal is to find m + n."
To break down the problem step by step:
"1. Compute PA, the distance between P(4,2) and A(0,0)."
"2. Compute PB, the distance between P(4,2) and B(8,–1)."
"3. Compute PC, the distance between P(4,2) and C(5,4)."
4. Sum the three distances and simplify the expression until it matches the form m + n√5.
"5. Identify m and n, then find m + n."
Let's start with the first step. Can you calculate the distance PA (from P to A)? Please show how you set that up and your result for that step.
"Student: Sure! To find the distance \( PA \) from point \( P(4,2) \) to point \( A(0,0) \), we can use the distance formula:"
\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
"In this case, \( (x_1, y_1) = (0, 0) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) = (4, 2) \). Plugging in these coordinates, we have:"
\[
PA = \sqrt{(4 - 0)^2 + (2 - 0)^2}
\]
Calculating the squares:
\[
PA = \sqrt{4^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{16 + 4} = \sqrt{20}
\]
We can simplify \( \sqrt{20} \) as follows:
\[
\sqrt{20} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 5} = 2\sqrt{5}
\]
"So, the distance \( PA \) is:"
\[
PA = 2\sqrt{5}
\]
"Now, would you like me to move on to the next step and calculate \( PB \) (the distance from \( P \) to \( B \))?"
Teacher: Great job! Your computation for PA was correct: you used the distance formula and simplified √20 to 2√5.
"Now, let's move on to the next step. Using the distance formula, can you find the distance PB from point P(4,2) to point B(8,–1)? Please set up the formula and show your calculation for PB."
"Student: Sure! To find the distance \( PB \) from point \( P(4,2) \) to point \( B(8,-1) \), we will again use the distance formula:"
\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
"Here, \( (x_1, y_1) = (4, 2) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) = (8, -1) \). Plugging in these coordinates, we have:"
\[
PB = \sqrt{(8 - 4)^2 + (-1 - 2)^2}
\]
Calculating the differences:
\[
PB = \sqrt{(4)^2 + (-3)^2}
\]
Now calculating the squares:
\[
PB = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25}
\]
Taking the square root gives us:
\[
PB = 5
\]
"So, the distance \( PB \) is \( 5 \). Would you like me to proceed to the next step and calculate \( PC \) (the distance from \( P \) to \( C \))?"
Teacher: Excellent work in finding PB = 5!
"Now, let’s move on to the next step. Using the distance formula, can you calculate the distance PC from P(4,2) to C(5,4)? Please set up the expression, show your calculation, and simplify your result."
"Student: Sure! To find the distance \( PC \) from point \( P(4,2) \) to point \( C(5,4) \), I will use the distance formula again:"
\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
"In this case, \( (x_1, y_1) = (4, 2) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) = (5, 4) \). Plugging in these coordinates, we have:"
\[
PC = \sqrt{(5 - 4)^2 + (4 - 2)^2}
\]
Calculating the differences:
\[
PC = \sqrt{(1)^2 + (2)^2}
\]
Now calculating the squares:
\[
PC = \sqrt{1 + 4} = \sqrt{5}
\]
"So, the distance \( PC \) is \( \sqrt{5} \). "
"Now that I have computed \( PA \), \( PB \), and \( PC \), would you like me to sum these distances to get the total distance from \( P \) to the vertices of triangle \( ABC \)?"
"Teacher: Great job computing PA, PB, and PC! So far we have:"
• PA = 2√5  
• PB = 5  
• PC = √5
"Now, for the next step, sum these distances to get an expression in the form m + n√5. Remember to combine the like radical terms. Please set up the sum and simplify it. What result do you get for the total distance?"
"Student: Sure! Now that we have all the distances, we can sum them up:"
\[
\text{Total Distance} = PA + PB + PC = 2\sqrt{5} + 5 + \sqrt{5}
\]
"Next, we can combine the like terms. The terms involving \(\sqrt{5}\) are \(2\sqrt{5}\) and \(\sqrt{5}\):"
\[
\text{Total Distance} = (2\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{5}) + 5 = 3\sqrt{5} + 5
\]
This expression can be rewritten as:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = 5 + 3\sqrt{5}
\]
"Now, we can identify \(m\) and \(n\) from the expression \(m + n\sqrt{5}\):"
- \(m = 5\)
- \(n = 3\)
"Finally, we need to find \(m + n\):"
\[
m + n = 5 + 3 = 8
\]
"So, the final result is:"
\[
\boxed{8}
\]
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly summed the distances:
PA = 2√5  
PB = 5  
PC = √5  
"So the total distance is 2√5 + 5 + √5 = 5 + 3√5, which gives m = 5 and n = 3. Therefore, m + n = 5 + 3 = 8."
8$
