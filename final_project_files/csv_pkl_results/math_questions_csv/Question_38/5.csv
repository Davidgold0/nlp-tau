"Question: Wanda is trying to locate the Fermat point $P$ of $\triangle ABC$, where $A$ is at the origin, $B$ is at $(8,-1)$, and $C$ is at $(5,4)$ (the Fermat point is the point such that the sum of its distances from the vertices of a triangle is minimized). She guesses that the point is at $P = (4,2)$, and computes the sum of the distances from $P$ to the vertices of $\triangle ABC$. If she obtains $m + n\sqrt{5}$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers, what is $m + n$?_x000D_"

"Teacher: Let's begin by breaking down the problem. We have to find the sum of the distances from point P = (4,2) to the vertices A = (0,0), B = (8,–1), and C = (5,4). Then we need to express that sum in the form m + n√5, and finally find m + n."
"The first step is to compute the distance from P to one of the vertices. Let’s start with vertex A. Using the distance formula, the distance from P = (4,2) to A = (0,0) is given by:"
"  d(P, A) = √[(4 – 0)² + (2 – 0)²]."
Could you calculate that distance and show your work for this step?
"Student: Sure! To calculate the distance from point \( P = (4, 2) \) to vertex \( A = (0, 0) \), we can use the distance formula:"
\[
"d(P, A) = \sqrt{(4 - 0)^2 + (2 - 0)^2}"
\]
Calculating each part:
1. \( (4 - 0)^2 = 4^2 = 16 \)
2. \( (2 - 0)^2 = 2^2 = 4 \)
"Now, we can add these two results together:"
\[
"d(P, A) = \sqrt{16 + 4} = \sqrt{20}"
\]
"Next, we can simplify \( \sqrt{20} \):"
\[
\sqrt{20} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 5} = 2\sqrt{5}
\]
"So, the distance from \( P \) to \( A \) is \( 2\sqrt{5} \). "
Would you like me to proceed with calculating the distances from \( P \) to vertices \( B \) and \( C \) next?
Teacher: Good work on computing the distance from P to A!
"Now, let's move on to the next step: finding the distance from point P = (4,2) to vertex B = (8,–1)."
"To do this, use the distance formula:"
"  d(P, B) = √[(x_B – x_P)² + (y_B – y_P)²]."
Please calculate the distance from P to B using this formula and show your work.
"Student: Student: Alright! To calculate the distance from point \( P = (4, 2) \) to vertex \( B = (8, -1) \), we will use the distance formula:"
\[
"d(P, B) = \sqrt{(8 - 4)^2 + (-1 - 2)^2}"
\]
Calculating each part:
1. \( (8 - 4)^2 = 4^2 = 16 \)
2. \( (-1 - 2)^2 = (-3)^2 = 9 \)
"Now, we can add these two results together:"
\[
"d(P, B) = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25}"
\]
Simplifying \( \sqrt{25} \):
\[
\sqrt{25} = 5
\]
"So, the distance from \( P \) to \( B \) is \( 5 \). "
Shall I continue with the calculation for the distance from \( P \) to vertex \( C \)?
Teacher: Great job on calculating the distance from P to B!
"Now, let's move on to the next step: calculating the distance from point P = (4,2) to vertex C = (5,4). Use the distance formula:"
"  d(P, C) = √[(x_C – x_P)² + (y_C – y_P)²]."
Can you compute this distance? Please show your work for the calculation from P to C.
"Student: Sure! To calculate the distance from point \( P = (4, 2) \) to vertex \( C = (5, 4) \), we will use the distance formula:"
\[
"d(P, C) = \sqrt{(5 - 4)^2 + (4 - 2)^2}"
\]
Calculating each part:
1. \( (5 - 4)^2 = 1^2 = 1 \)
2. \( (4 - 2)^2 = 2^2 = 4 \)
"Now, we can add these two results together:"
\[
"d(P, C) = \sqrt{1 + 4} = \sqrt{5}"
\]
"So, the distance from \( P \) to \( C \) is \( \sqrt{5} \)."
"Now that we have the distances from \( P \) to all three vertices, we can summarize them:"
- Distance from \( P \) to \( A \): \( 2\sqrt{5} \)
- Distance from \( P \) to \( B \): \( 5 \)
- Distance from \( P \) to \( C \): \( \sqrt{5} \)
Shall I now calculate the total sum of these distances?
"Teacher: Great work on computing the individual distances! Now, let's take the next step. We have:"
" • d(P, A) = 2√5  "
" • d(P, B) = 5  "
" • d(P, C) = √5  "
The sum of these distances is S = 2√5 + 5 + √5.
"Please combine like terms in this expression to write S in the form m + n√5, where m and n are integers. Once you've done that, determine the values of m and n, and then compute m + n. What do you get?"
"Student: To find the sum of the distances, we start with the expression:"
\[
S = 2\sqrt{5} + 5 + \sqrt{5}
\]
"Now, we can combine the like terms involving \(\sqrt{5}\):"
\[
S = (2\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{5}) + 5 = 3\sqrt{5} + 5
\]
"Now, we can express \(S\) in the form \(m + n\sqrt{5}\):"
"- Here, \(m = 5\) and \(n = 3\)."
"Finally, we compute \(m + n\):"
\[
m + n = 5 + 3 = 8
\]
"Thus, the final answer is:"
\[
\boxed{8}
\]
"Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly found that S = 5 + 3√5, so m = 5 and n = 3, and indeed m + n = 8. "
8$
