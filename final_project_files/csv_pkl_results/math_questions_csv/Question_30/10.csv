Question: What is the sum of all the positive divisors of 91?
"3o-mini: To find the sum of all the positive divisors of 91, follow these steps:"
1. Factorize 91:  
   91 = 7 Ã— 13
2. List its positive divisors:  
"   Since 91 is a product of two distinct primes, its positive divisors are 1, 7, 13, and 91."
3. Add the divisors:  
   1 + 7 + 13 + 91 = 112
"Therefore, the sum of all the positive divisors of 91 is 112."
