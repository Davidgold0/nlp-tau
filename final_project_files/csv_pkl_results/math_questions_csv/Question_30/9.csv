Question: What is the sum of all the positive divisors of 91?
"3o-mini: First, factor 91 into its prime factors:"
  91 = 7 × 13
The positive divisors of 91 come from all combinations of these prime factors with exponent 0 or 1:
"  Divisors: 7^0 × 13^0 = 1, "
"       7^1 × 13^0 = 7, "
"       7^0 × 13^1 = 13, "
       7^1 × 13^1 = 91
"Now, add these divisors:"
  1 + 7 + 13 + 91 = 112
"Thus, the sum of all the positive divisors of 91 is 112."
