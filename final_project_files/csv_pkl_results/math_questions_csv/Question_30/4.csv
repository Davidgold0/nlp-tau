Question: What is the sum of all the positive divisors of 91?
"Teacher: Okay, let’s break down the problem into smaller steps before finding the final result."
Step 1: We need to find the prime factorization of 91. This means expressing 91 as a product of its prime numbers.
Could you please start by determining the prime factors of 91?
"Student: Sure! To find the prime factorization of 91, I can start by checking for divisibility by the smallest prime numbers."
"First, I can see that 91 is not even, so it’s not divisible by 2. Next, I check for divisibility by 3 by adding the digits (9 + 1 = 10), and since 10 is not divisible by 3, 91 is not divisible by 3 either."
"Next, I check 5, but since 91 does not end in 0 or 5, it’s not divisible by 5. "
"Now, I can check 7. When I divide 91 by 7, I get:"
\[ 91 ÷ 7 = 13 \]
"Since both 7 and 13 are prime numbers, I have found the prime factorization of 91:"
\[ 91 = 7 \times 13 \]
Is that correct?
Teacher: Great work on finding the prime factorization of 91 as 7 × 13! Your reasoning was clear and correct.
"Now, let’s move on to the next step. Using the prime factors, we need to determine the sum of all the positive divisors of 91. One way to do this is to first list all the positive divisors by considering the exponents of the prime factors. For a number like 91 = 7¹ × 13¹, the divisors can be written in the form 7^a × 13^b, where a and b can be 0 or 1."
Could you please list all the positive divisors of 91 using this method?
"Student: Sure! To find all the positive divisors of 91 using the prime factorization \( 91 = 7^1 \times 13^1 \), I will consider the possible values for \( a \) and \( b \)."
"Since both \( a \) and \( b \) can be either 0 or 1, I will list the combinations:"
"1. \( a = 0, b = 0 \): \( 7^0 \times 13^0 = 1 \)"
"2. \( a = 0, b = 1 \): \( 7^0 \times 13^1 = 13 \)"
"3. \( a = 1, b = 0 \): \( 7^1 \times 13^0 = 7 \)"
"4. \( a = 1, b = 1 \): \( 7^1 \times 13^1 = 91 \)"
"So, the positive divisors of 91 are: "
"1, 7, 13, and 91."
Is that correct?
Teacher: Great job listing all the divisors correctly!
"Now, let’s move on to the next step. We need to compute the sum of these divisors. Could you please add the numbers 1, 7, 13, and 91 together to find the sum? Please show your work for this step."
"Student: Student: Okay! To find the sum of the positive divisors of 91, I will add the numbers 1, 7, 13, and 91 together. "
Here’s the calculation step-by-step:
"1. First, I add 1 and 7:"
   \[
   1 + 7 = 8
   \]
"2. Next, I add 13 to the result:"
   \[
   8 + 13 = 21
   \]
"3. Finally, I add 91 to that sum:"
   \[
   21 + 91 = 112
   \]
"So, the sum of all the positive divisors of 91 is \( 112 \). "
Is that correct?
"Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly added the divisors to get 112. To summarize, we first factored 91 as 7 × 13, then listed its positive divisors as 1, 7, 13, and 91; finally, you accurately computed their sum as 112."
