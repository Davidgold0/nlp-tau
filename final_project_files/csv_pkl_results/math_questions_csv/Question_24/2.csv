"Question: There exist constants $c_2,$ $c_1,$ and $c_0$ such that_x000D_"
\[x^3 + x^2 - 5 = (x - 3)^3 + c_2 (x - 3)^2 + c_1 (x - 3) + c_0.\]Find $c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2.$
Teacher: Let's start by understanding what the problem is asking. The equation
  x³ + x² – 5 = (x – 3)³ + c₂(x – 3)² + c₁(x – 3) + c₀
"indicates that if we expand the right-hand side and simplify, then the coefficients of like powers of x on both sides must agree. The goal is to determine the constants c₂, c₁, and c₀ and then compute c₂² + c₁² + c₀²."
A good plan to tackle this problem is to follow these steps:
1. Expand (x – 3)³.
2. Expand (x – 3)² if needed.
3. Write out the full expansion of the right-hand side.
4. Collect like terms and equate them with the left-hand side.
"5. Solve the system of equations to find c₂, c₁, and c₀."
"6. Finally, compute c₂² + c₁² + c₀²."
Let's begin with step 1.
Step 1: Expand (x – 3)³.
Could you please provide the expansion of (x – 3)³?
"Student: Sure! To expand \((x - 3)^3\), we can use the binomial expansion formula or simply multiply it out step by step."
"Using the formula, we have:"
\[
(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 3 \cdot 3x^2 + 3 \cdot 3^2x - 3^3
\]
Calculating each term:
- The first term is \(x^3\).
- The second term is \(-9x^2\) (since \(-3 \cdot 3 = -9\)).
- The third term is \(27x\) (since \(3 \cdot 9 = 27\)).
- The last term is \(-27\) (since \(-3^3 = -27\)).
"Putting it all together, we get:"
\[
(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27
\]
Is that correct?
Teacher: That's correct—the expansion of (x – 3)³ as x³ – 9x² + 27x – 27 is right.
Let's move on to the next step of our plan:
Step 2: Expand (x – 3)².
Could you please provide the expansion of (x – 3)²?
"Student: Student: Sure! To expand \((x - 3)^2\), we can use the formula for squaring a binomial, which is \((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\)."
"Applying this to \((x - 3)^2\), we have:"
\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 2 \cdot 3 \cdot x + 3^2
\]
Calculating each term:
- The first term is \(x^2\).
- The second term is \(-6x\) (since \(-2 \cdot 3 = -6\)).
- The last term is \(9\) (since \(3^2 = 9\)).
"Putting it all together, we get:"
\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9
\]
Is that correct?
Teacher: Great job on expanding (x – 3)²!
"Now that we have the expansions for (x – 3)³ and (x – 3)², let's move to the next step."
Step 3: Expand the full right-hand side of the equation:
  (x – 3)³ + c₂ (x – 3)² + c₁ (x – 3) + c₀
"Can you expand this by substituting in the expressions for (x – 3)³ and (x – 3)², and then combine like terms (i.e., the x³, x², x, and constant terms) on the right-hand side? Please show your work for this step."
Student: Sure! Let's expand the right-hand side of the equation:
\[
(x - 3)^3 + c_2 (x - 3)^2 + c_1 (x - 3) + c_0.
\]
We already know:
\[
"(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27,"
\]
and 
\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9.
\]
Now we can substitute these expansions into the right-hand side:
1. Substitute \((x - 3)^3\):
   \[
   x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27.
   \]
2. Substitute \(c_2 (x - 3)^2\):
   \[
   c_2 (x^2 - 6x + 9) = c_2 x^2 - 6c_2 x + 9c_2.
   \]
3. Substitute \(c_1 (x - 3)\):
   \[
   c_1 (x - 3) = c_1 x - 3c_1.
   \]
"4. Finally, add \(c_0\):"
   \[
   c_0.
   \]
"Putting it all together, we have:"
\[
x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27 + c_2 x^2 - 6c_2 x + 9c_2 + c_1 x - 3c_1 + c_0.
\]
Now let's combine like terms:
- For \(x^3\): \(1x^3\).
- For \(x^2\): \(-9c_2 + c_2 = (-9 + c_2)x^2\).
- For \(x\): \(27 - 6c_2 + c_1\).
- For the constant term: \(-27 + 9c_2 - 3c_1 + c_0\).
"Thus, the expanded right-hand side is:"
\[
x^3 + (-9 + c_2)x^2 + (27 - 6c_2 + c_1)x + (-27 + 9c_2 - 3c_1 + c_0).
\]
Is that expansion correct?
Teacher: Great work on the expansion! Your expanded form of the right‐hand side is:
  x³ + (–9 + c₂)x² + (27 – 6c₂ + c₁)x + (–27 + 9c₂ – 3c₁ + c₀).
"Now, let's move on to the next step:"
Step 4: Equate the coefficients of like powers of x from the right-hand side to those on the left-hand side. Recall that the left-hand side is
  x³ + x² – 5.
"Please set up the system of equations by matching the coefficients for x³, x², x, and the constant terms. Could you provide the equations you get from equating these coefficients?"
"Student: Sure! Let's equate the coefficients of the left-hand side, which is \(x^3 + x^2 - 5\), with the coefficients from the expanded right-hand side, which we found to be:"
\[
x^3 + (-9 + c_2)x^2 + (27 - 6c_2 + c_1)x + (-27 + 9c_2 - 3c_1 + c_0).
\]
"Now, we will match the coefficients for each power of \(x\):"
"1. For \(x^3\): The coefficients are equal, so we have:"
   \[
   1 = 1 \quad \text{(This is trivially true)}
   \]
2. For \(x^2\): We equate the coefficients:
   \[
   -9 + c_2 = 1.
   \]
   Rearranging gives us:
   \[
   c_2 = 1 + 9 = 10.
   \]
3. For \(x\): We equate the coefficients:
   \[
   27 - 6c_2 + c_1 = 0.
   \]
   Substituting \(c_2 = 10\):
   \[
   27 - 6(10) + c_1 = 0 \implies 27 - 60 + c_1 = 0 \implies c_1 = 60 - 27 = 33.
   \]
4. For the constant term: We equate the coefficients:
   \[
   -27 + 9c_2 - 3c_1 + c_0 = -5.
   \]
   Substituting \(c_2 = 10\) and \(c_1 = 33\):
   \[
   -27 + 9(10) - 3(33) + c_0 = -5.
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   -27 + 90 - 99 + c_0 = -5 \implies -36 + c_0 = -5 \implies c_0 = -5 + 36 = 31.
   \]
"So, we have the constants:"
- \(c_2 = 10\)
- \(c_1 = 33\)
- \(c_0 = 31\)
Now we can summarize the equations we derived:
1. \(c_2 = 10\)
2. \(c_1 = 33\)
3. \(c_0 = 31\)
Is that correct? Would you like me to move on to the final step to compute \(c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2\)?
Teacher: Great work on setting up and solving the system of equations correctly! You found:
"  c₂ = 10, c₁ = 33, c₀ = 31."
"Now, let's move to our final step:"
Step 5: Compute c₂² + c₁² + c₀².
"To do this, please:"
" • Square each constant (i.e., calculate c₂², c₁², and c₀²)."
 • Then add these three squared values together.
Could you please perform these calculations and give me the final sum?
"Student: Sure! Let's calculate \(c_2^2\), \(c_1^2\), and \(c_0^2\) using the values we found:"
1. \(c_2 = 10\):
   \[
   c_2^2 = 10^2 = 100.
   \]
2. \(c_1 = 33\):
   \[
   c_1^2 = 33^2 = 1089.
   \]
3. \(c_0 = 31\):
   \[
   c_0^2 = 31^2 = 961.
   \]
"Now, let's add these squared values together:"
\[
c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2 = 100 + 1089 + 961.
\]
Calculating this sum:
\[
"100 + 1089 = 1189,"
\]
\[
1189 + 961 = 2150.
\]
"Thus, the final result is:"
\[
c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2 = 2150.
\]
Is that correct?
"Teacher: Excellent work! Your calculations are correct: c₂² = 100, c₁² = 1089, and c₀² = 961, which sum to 2150."
Final Answer: 2150$
