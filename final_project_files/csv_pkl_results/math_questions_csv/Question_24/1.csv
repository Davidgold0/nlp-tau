"Question: There exist constants $c_2,$ $c_1,$ and $c_0$ such that_x000D_"
\[x^3 + x^2 - 5 = (x - 3)^3 + c_2 (x - 3)^2 + c_1 (x - 3) + c_0.\]Find $c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2.$
"Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem. We want to find constants c₂, c₁, and c₀ such that:"
  x³ + x² – 5 = (x – 3)³ + c₂·(x – 3)² + c₁·(x – 3) + c₀.
"A good first step is to re-express the right-hand side so it’s easier to compare with the left-hand side. To do this, we need to expand (x – 3)³."
"Could you please work on and share the expanded form of (x – 3)³? Once you provide that, we’ll review your work for this step before moving on."
Student: Sure! Let's expand \((x - 3)^3\):
"Using the binomial expansion, we have:"
\[
(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 3 \cdot 3x^2 + 3 \cdot 3^2x - 3^3
\]
Calculating each term:
1. The first term is \(x^3\).
2. The second term is \(-9x^2\) (since \(-3 \cdot 3 = -9\)).
3. The third term is \(27x\) (since \(3 \cdot 9 = 27\)).
4. The last term is \(-27\) (since \(-3^3 = -27\)).
"Putting it all together, we get:"
\[
(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27
\]
"So, the expanded form of \((x - 3)^3\) is:"
\[
x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27
\]
"Let me know if this looks good, and if I should proceed with the next steps!"
Teacher: Great job! Your expansion of (x – 3)³ is correct:
  (x – 3)³ = x³ – 9x² + 27x – 27.
"Now, let’s move to the next step. We need to set up the full expression on the right-hand side of the equation:"
  (x – 3)³ + c₂·(x – 3)² + c₁·(x – 3) + c₀.
"Before we expand the remaining terms, could you work on expanding (x – 3)²? Please show your expansion along with a brief explanation of the steps you followed."
Student: Sure! Let's expand \((x - 3)^2\):
"Using the binomial expansion, we have:"
\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 2 \cdot 3x + 3^2
\]
Calculating each term:
1. The first term is \(x^2\).
2. The second term is \(-6x\) (since \(-2 \cdot 3 = -6\)).
3. The last term is \(9\) (since \(3^2 = 9\)).
"Putting it all together, we get:"
\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9
\]
"So, the expanded form of \((x - 3)^2\) is:"
\[
x^2 - 6x + 9
\]
"Let me know if this is correct, and if I should proceed with the next steps!"
Teacher: Your expansion of (x – 3)² is correct:
  (x – 3)² = x² – 6x + 9.
"Now, let’s move on to the next step. We have the full expression on the right-hand side:"
  (x – 3)³ + c₂·(x – 3)² + c₁·(x – 3) + c₀.
"We already expanded (x – 3)³ and (x – 3)². The next step is to substitute these expansions into the full expression and then combine like terms. This will give us a polynomial in x, and we can compare its coefficients with those from the left-hand side, x³ + x² – 5."
Could you please expand the entire right-hand side by:
 1. Replacing (x – 3)³ and (x – 3)² with their expanded forms.
 2. Distributing the constants c₂ and c₁ appropriately.
" 3. Collecting like terms (grouping the coefficients of x³, x², x, and the constant)?"
Please work on that and share your expanded expression.
Student: Sure! Let's substitute the expanded forms of \((x - 3)^3\) and \((x - 3)^2\) into the right-hand side of the equation:
We have:
\[
(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27
\]
and
\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9.
\]
"Now, substituting these into the right-hand side expression:"
\[
(x - 3)^3 + c_2 \cdot (x - 3)^2 + c_1 \cdot (x - 3) + c_0
\]
becomes:
\[
x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27 + c_2(x^2 - 6x + 9) + c_1(x - 3) + c_0.
\]
"Next, we distribute \(c_2\) and \(c_1\):"
1. For \(c_2(x^2 - 6x + 9)\):
   - \(c_2 \cdot x^2\)
   - \(-6c_2 \cdot x\)
   - \(9c_2\)
2. For \(c_1(x - 3)\):
   - \(c_1 \cdot x\)
   - \(-3c_1\)
"Now, combining everything, we have:"
\[
x^3 + (-9 + c_2)x^2 + (27 - 6c_2 + c_1)x + (-27 + 9c_2 - 3c_1 + c_0).
\]
"Now, let's group the terms:"
- The coefficient of \(x^3\) is \(1\).
- The coefficient of \(x^2\) is \(-9 + c_2\).
- The coefficient of \(x\) is \(27 - 6c_2 + c_1\).
- The constant term is \(-27 + 9c_2 - 3c_1 + c_0\).
Now we compare this with the left-hand side \(x^3 + x^2 - 5\):
- Coefficient of \(x^3\): \(1 = 1\) (this is already satisfied).
- Coefficient of \(x^2\): \(-9 + c_2 = 1\).
- Coefficient of \(x\): \(27 - 6c_2 + c_1 = 0\).
- Constant term: \(-27 + 9c_2 - 3c_1 + c_0 = -5\).
"Now we can solve these equations for \(c_2\), \(c_1\), and \(c_0\). "
1. From \(-9 + c_2 = 1\):
   \[
   c_2 = 10.
   \]
2. Substitute \(c_2 = 10\) into the second equation:
   \[
   27 - 6(10) + c_1 = 0 \implies 27 - 60 + c_1 = 0 \implies c_1 = 33.
   \]
3. Substitute \(c_2 = 10\) and \(c_1 = 33\) into the third equation:
   \[
   -27 + 9(10) - 3(33) + c_0 = -5 \implies -27 + 90 - 99 + c_0 = -5.
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   -36 + c_0 = -5 \implies c_0 = 31.
   \]
Now we have:
- \(c_2 = 10\)
- \(c_1 = 33\)
- \(c_0 = 31\)
"Finally, we need to find \(c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2\):"
\[
"c_2^2 = 10^2 = 100,"
\]
\[
"c_1^2 = 33^2 = 1089,"
\]
\[
c_0^2 = 31^2 = 961.
\]
Adding these together:
\[
c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2 = 100 + 1089 + 961 = 2150.
\]
"So, the final answer is:"
\[
\boxed{2150}.
\]
"Teacher: Excellent work! Your expansion, combination of like terms, and solving for c₂, c₁, and c₀ are all correct. Now, could you verify the final step by showing the sum of the squares of c₂, c₁, and c₀? Please calculate c₂² + c₁² + c₀² based on your computed values and share your explanation."
Student: Sure! Let's verify the final step by calculating \(c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2\) using the values we found:
"1. We found \(c_2 = 10\), \(c_1 = 33\), and \(c_0 = 31\)."
"Now, calculating each square:"
- For \(c_2^2\):
\[
c_2^2 = 10^2 = 100.
\]
- For \(c_1^2\):
\[
c_1^2 = 33^2 = 1089.
\]
- For \(c_0^2\):
\[
c_0^2 = 31^2 = 961.
\]
"Next, we add these values together:"
\[
c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2 = 100 + 1089 + 961.
\]
Calculating the sum step-by-step:
"1. First, add \(100 + 1089\):"
\[
100 + 1089 = 1189.
\]
"2. Then, add \(1189 + 961\):"
\[
1189 + 961 = 2150.
\]
"Thus, the final result is:"
\[
c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2 = 2150.
\]
"So, the final answer remains:"
\[
\boxed{2150}.
\]
Thank you for guiding me through the problem!
"Teacher: You've done an excellent job working through every step of this problem—from expanding the binomials to comparing coefficients and solving for the constants, and finally, verifying the sum of their squares. "
To recap:
1. We expanded (x – 3)³ and (x – 3)².
2. We substituted these into the expression (x – 3)³ + c₂·(x – 3)² + c₁·(x – 3) + c₀ and collected like terms.
"3. By comparing coefficients with the polynomial x³ + x² – 5, we solved for c₂ = 10, c₁ = 33, and c₀ = 31."
"4. Finally, we computed c₂² + c₁² + c₀² = 10² + 33² + 31² = 100 + 1089 + 961 = 2150."
The final answer is:
2150$
