"Question: There exist constants $c_2,$ $c_1,$ and $c_0$ such that_x000D_"
\[x^3 + x^2 - 5 = (x - 3)^3 + c_2 (x - 3)^2 + c_1 (x - 3) + c_0.\]Find $c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2.$
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem. We want to express
  x³ + x² − 5
in the form
  (x − 3)³ + c₂ (x − 3)² + c₁ (x − 3) + c₀.
This will involve rewriting the original polynomial by expanding (x − 3)³ and then matching coefficients with the left-hand side. Here’s a suggested outline for how we can approach this problem:
1. Begin by expanding (x − 3)³. Write out the expanded form.
"2. Next, expand c₂ (x − 3)², c₁ (x − 3), and leave c₀ as is."
"3. Combine like terms (i.e., collect the coefficients for x³, x², x, and the constant term) on the right-hand side."
"4. Set the coefficients from the expanded right-hand side equal to the corresponding coefficients on the left-hand side for the terms x³, x², x, and the constant."
"5. Solve the system of equations to determine c₂, c₁, and c₀."
"6. Lastly, compute c₂² + c₁² + c₀²."
Let's start with the first step. Could you please expand (x − 3)³ and show me what you get?
Student: Sure! Let's start by expanding \((x - 3)^3\).
"Using the binomial expansion, we have:"
\[
(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 3 \cdot 3x^2 + 3 \cdot 3^2 x - 3^3
\]
"Calculating each term, we get:"
1. The \(x^3\) term is \(x^3\).
"2. The \(x^2\) term: \(-3 \cdot 3 = -9\), so we have \(-9x^2\)."
"3. The \(x\) term: \(3 \cdot 9 = 27\), so we have \(27x\)."
4. The constant term: \(-27\).
"Putting it all together, we have:"
\[
(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27
\]
"Now, I can write this expanded form. Would you like me to move on to the next step, which is to expand \(c_2 (x - 3)^2\), \(c_1 (x - 3)\), and \(c_0\)?"
Teacher: Excellent work on expanding (x – 3)³ correctly! Now let's move on to the next step. We need to expand c₂(x – 3)². Can you first expand (x – 3)² and then multiply your result by c₂? Please show your work for this step.
Student: Sure! Let's start by expanding \((x - 3)^2\).
"Using the binomial expansion, we have:"
\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 2 \cdot 3 x + 3^2
\]
"Calculating each term, we get:"
1. The \(x^2\) term is \(x^2\).
"2. The \(x\) term: \(-2 \cdot 3 = -6\), so we have \(-6x\)."
3. The constant term is \(9\).
"Putting it all together, we have:"
\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9
\]
"Now, multiplying this by \(c_2\), we get:"
\[
c_2 (x - 3)^2 = c_2 (x^2 - 6x + 9) = c_2 x^2 - 6c_2 x + 9c_2
\]
Shall I proceed to expand \(c_1 (x - 3)\) next?
"Teacher: Great job on expanding (x – 3)² and multiplying by c₂! Now, let’s tackle the next part. Can you please expand c₁(x – 3) by distributing c₁ over the expression (x – 3)? Please show your work for this step."
Student: Sure! Let's expand \(c_1(x - 3)\) by distributing \(c_1\) over the expression:
\[
c_1(x - 3) = c_1 \cdot x - c_1 \cdot 3 = c_1 x - 3c_1
\]
Now we have the expression for \(c_1(x - 3)\). 
"Next, we can summarize what we've expanded so far:"
1. \((x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27\)
2. \(c_2(x - 3)^2 = c_2 x^2 - 6c_2 x + 9c_2\)
3. \(c_1(x - 3) = c_1 x - 3c_1\)
4. \(c_0\) remains as \(c_0\).
Would you like me to combine all these terms together now?
"Teacher: Great job so far! You've successfully expanded (x – 3)³, c₂(x – 3)², and c₁(x – 3). Now that we have:"
1. (x – 3)³ = x³ – 9x² + 27x – 27  
2. c₂(x – 3)² = c₂x² – 6c₂x + 9c₂  
3. c₁(x – 3) = c₁x – 3c₁  
"4. And c₀ as it is,"
"The next step is to combine these expressions into one single polynomial on the right-hand side. Please combine the like terms (the x³, x², x, and constant terms) from all these parts. Write out the combined expression before equating coefficients to the left-hand side polynomial x³ + x² – 5. What do you get?"
Student: Sure! Let's combine all the expanded expressions we have:
Starting with:
1. \((x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27\)
2. \(c_2(x - 3)^2 = c_2 x^2 - 6c_2 x + 9c_2\)
3. \(c_1(x - 3) = c_1 x - 3c_1\)
4. \(c_0\) remains as \(c_0\).
"Now, let's combine them:"
\[
\text{Right-hand side} = (x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27) + (c_2 x^2 - 6c_2 x + 9c_2) + (c_1 x - 3c_1) + c_0
\]
Combining like terms:
- For \(x^3\): \(1x^3\)
- For \(x^2\): \(-9x^2 + c_2 x^2 = (-9 + c_2)x^2\)
- For \(x\): \(27x - 6c_2 x + c_1 x = (27 - 6c_2 + c_1)x\)
- For the constant term: \(-27 + 9c_2 - 3c_1 + c_0\)
"Putting it all together, we have:"
\[
x^3 + (-9 + c_2)x^2 + (27 - 6c_2 + c_1)x + (-27 + 9c_2 - 3c_1 + c_0)
\]
Now our combined expression on the right-hand side is:
\[
x^3 + (-9 + c_2)x^2 + (27 - 6c_2 + c_1)x + (-27 + 9c_2 - 3c_1 + c_0)
\]
"Next, we need to set the coefficients of this expression equal to the coefficients from the left-hand side \(x^3 + x^2 - 5\). "
Can you guide me on how to set up these equations for the coefficients?
"Teacher: Great work combining the terms! Now, remember that the original polynomial on the left-hand side is"
  x³ + x² – 5
which can be thought of as having coefficients:
"  x³: 1, x²: 1, x: 0, constant: –5."
You want to equate the coefficients from your combined right-hand side expression
  x³ + (-9 + c₂)x² + (27 - 6c₂ + c₁)x + (-27 + 9c₂ - 3c₁ + c₀)
to these.
"Could you please set up the system of equations by equating the coefficients of x³, x², x, and the constant term respectively? Write down each equation clearly."
Student: Sure! Let's set up the system of equations by equating the coefficients from the combined right-hand side expression with those from the left-hand side polynomial \(x^3 + x^2 - 5\).
1. For the coefficient of \(x^3\):
   \[
   1 = 1 \quad \text{(This equation is always true and does not provide any new information.)}
   \]
2. For the coefficient of \(x^2\):
   \[
   -9 + c_2 = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad c_2 = 1 + 9 = 10
   \]
3. For the coefficient of \(x\):
   \[
   27 - 6c_2 + c_1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad c_1 = -27 + 6c_2
   \]
   Substituting \(c_2 = 10\):
   \[
   c_1 = -27 + 6 \cdot 10 = -27 + 60 = 33
   \]
4. For the constant term:
   \[
   -27 + 9c_2 - 3c_1 + c_0 = -5
   \]
   Substituting \(c_2 = 10\) and \(c_1 = 33\):
   \[
   -27 + 9 \cdot 10 - 3 \cdot 33 + c_0 = -5
   \]
   \[
   -27 + 90 - 99 + c_0 = -5
   \]
   \[
   -36 + c_0 = -5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad c_0 = -5 + 36 = 31
   \]
Now we have the values:
- \(c_2 = 10\)
- \(c_1 = 33\)
- \(c_0 = 31\)
"Next, we need to compute \(c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2\). Would you like me to calculate that now?"
"Teacher: Great work setting up and solving the equations! You found that c₂ = 10, c₁ = 33, and c₀ = 31. "
"Now, the final step is to compute c₂² + c₁² + c₀² using these values."
Could you please calculate 10² + 33² + 31² and show your working?
Student: Sure! Let's calculate \(c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2\) using the values we found:
1. Calculate \(c_2^2\):
   \[
   c_2^2 = 10^2 = 100
   \]
2. Calculate \(c_1^2\):
   \[
   c_1^2 = 33^2 = 1089
   \]
3. Calculate \(c_0^2\):
   \[
   c_0^2 = 31^2 = 961
   \]
"Now, we can add these values together:"
\[
c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2 = 100 + 1089 + 961
\]
Calculating the sum step by step:
"- First, add \(100 + 1089\):"
  \[
  100 + 1089 = 1189
  \]
"- Now, add \(1189 + 961\):"
  \[
  1189 + 961 = 2150
  \]
"So, \(c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2 = 2150\)."
"Thus, the final answer is:"
\[
\boxed{2150}
\]
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly computed each step and arrived at the final answer. The final result is 2150$
