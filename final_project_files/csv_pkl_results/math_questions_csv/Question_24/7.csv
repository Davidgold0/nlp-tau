"Question: There exist constants $c_2,$ $c_1,$ and $c_0$ such that_x000D_"
\[x^3 + x^2 - 5 = (x - 3)^3 + c_2 (x - 3)^2 + c_1 (x - 3) + c_0.\]Find $c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2.$
"3o-mini: We start by writing x in terms of (x - 3). Let y = x - 3, so that x = y + 3."
Substitute into the given polynomial:
  x³ + x² - 5 = (y + 3)³ + (y + 3)² - 5.
Now expand each term:
"  (y + 3)³ = y³ + 3(3)y² + 3(3²)y + 3³ = y³ + 9y² + 27y + 27,"
  (y + 3)² = y² + 6y + 9.
"Thus,"
  x³ + x² - 5 = y³ + 9y² + 27y + 27 + y² + 6y + 9 - 5
             = y³ + (9y² + y²) + (27y + 6y) + (27 + 9 - 5)
             = y³ + 10y² + 33y + 31.
The problem states that
"  x³ + x² - 5 = (x - 3)³ + c₂(x - 3)² + c₁(x - 3) + c₀,"
"or equivalently, with y = x - 3,"
  y³ + 10y² + 33y + 31 = y³ + c₂y² + c₁y + c₀.
"By equating the coefficients from both sides, we obtain:"
"  c₂ = 10,"
"  c₁ = 33,"
  c₀ = 31.
"Finally, compute c₂² + c₁² + c₀²:"
  c₂² + c₁² + c₀² = 10² + 33² + 31² = 100 + 1089 + 961 = 2150.
"Thus, the answer is 2150."
