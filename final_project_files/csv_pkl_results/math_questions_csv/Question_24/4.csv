"Question: There exist constants $c_2,$ $c_1,$ and $c_0$ such that_x000D_"
\[x^3 + x^2 - 5 = (x - 3)^3 + c_2 (x - 3)^2 + c_1 (x - 3) + c_0.\]Find $c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2.$
Teacher: Let's begin by rephrasing the problem:
"We need to find numbers c₂, c₁, and c₀ such that"
  x³ + x² – 5 = (x – 3)³ + c₂(x – 3)² + c₁(x – 3) + c₀.
"Once we determine c₂, c₁, and c₀ by comparing the coefficients on both sides, we are asked to compute c₂² + c₁² + c₀²."
Here’s an outline of the steps to solve the problem:
1. Expand (x – 3)³ and (x – 3)².
2. Write out the full expression (x – 3)³ + c₂(x – 3)² + c₁(x – 3) + c₀ in expanded form.
"3. Collect like terms (grouping the coefficients for x³, x², x, and the constant terms)."
4. Compare the coefficients with the corresponding terms from x³ + x² – 5.
"5. Solve the resulting system of equations for c₂, c₁, and c₀."
"6. Finally, compute c₂² + c₁² + c₀²."
Let’s start with the first step. Could you please expand (x – 3)³? Tell me what you get.
"Student: Sure! To expand \((x - 3)^3\), we can use the binomial expansion formula or expand it step by step. "
Using the binomial expansion:
\[
(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 3 \cdot 3 \cdot x^2 + 3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot x - 3^3
\]
Calculating each term:
1. The first term is \(x^3\).
2. The second term is \(-3 \cdot 3 \cdot x^2 = -9x^2\).
3. The third term is \(3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot x = 27x\).
4. The last term is \(-3^3 = -27\).
"Putting it all together, we have:"
\[
(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27.
\]
"So, the expansion of \((x - 3)^3\) is:"
\[
x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27.
\]
What should we do next?
Teacher: Great job! Your expansion of (x – 3)³ is correct.
"Now, as the next step, please expand (x – 3)². What do you get when you do that?"
"Student: Student: To expand \((x - 3)^2\), we can use the formula for the square of a binomial:"
\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 2 \cdot 3 \cdot x + 3^2.
\]
Calculating each term:
1. The first term is \(x^2\).
2. The second term is \(-2 \cdot 3 \cdot x = -6x\).
3. The last term is \(3^2 = 9\).
"Putting it all together, we have:"
\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9.
\]
What should we do next?
Teacher: Great work on expanding (x – 3)² correctly!
"Now, the next step is to substitute the expansions into the expression"
  (x – 3)³ + c₂(x – 3)² + c₁(x – 3) + c₀.
We know that:
  (x – 3)³ = x³ – 9x² + 27x – 27  
  (x – 3)² = x² – 6x + 9  
  (x – 3) = x – 3
"Please substitute these into the expression to write it in expanded form (grouping the x³, x², x, and constant terms). What do you get?"
Student: Sure! Let's substitute the expansions into the expression:
We have:
\[
"(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27,"
\]
\[
"(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9,"
\]
\[
(x - 3) = x - 3.
\]
Now substituting these into the expression:
\[
(x - 3)^3 + c_2(x - 3)^2 + c_1(x - 3) + c_0
\]
becomes:
\[
x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27 + c_2(x^2 - 6x + 9) + c_1(x - 3) + c_0.
\]
"Now, let's distribute \(c_2\) and \(c_1\):"
\[
= x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27 + c_2x^2 - 6c_2x + 9c_2 + c_1x - 3c_1 + c_0.
\]
"Now, we can group the terms by their degrees:"
1. The \(x^3\) term: \(x^3\)
2. The \(x^2\) terms: \(-9x^2 + c_2x^2 = (-9 + c_2)x^2\)
3. The \(x\) terms: \(27x - 6c_2x + c_1x = (27 - 6c_2 + c_1)x\)
4. The constant terms: \(-27 + 9c_2 - 3c_1 + c_0\)
"Putting it all together, we have:"
\[
x^3 + (-9 + c_2)x^2 + (27 - 6c_2 + c_1)x + (-27 + 9c_2 - 3c_1 + c_0).
\]
What should we do next?
"Teacher: Great! Now we need to compare the expression we just obtained with the original polynomial on the left-hand side, which is"
  x³ + x² – 5.
Notice that the expanded expression we got is
  x³ + (-9 + c₂)x² + (27 – 6c₂ + c₁)x + (-27 + 9c₂ – 3c₁ + c₀).
"To get the coefficients c₂, c₁, and c₀, we must equate the coefficients of x³, x², x, and the constant term from both sides. "
"Let's start with the x² terms: The coefficient from our expression is –9 + c₂, and from x³ + x² – 5 the coefficient is 1."
Can you set up and solve that equation for c₂? Please share your solution for this particular step.
Student: Sure! We need to set up the equation based on the coefficients of \(x^2\).
"From our expanded expression, the coefficient of \(x^2\) is \(-9 + c_2\). From the original polynomial \(x^3 + x^2 - 5\), the coefficient of \(x^2\) is \(1\)."
So we can set up the equation:
\[
-9 + c_2 = 1.
\]
"Now, let's solve for \(c_2\):"
\[
c_2 = 1 + 9 = 10.
\]
"So, we have found that \(c_2 = 10\)."
What should we do next?
Teacher: Excellent work solving for c₂!
Now let's compare the coefficients of the x terms from both sides of the equation. Recall that the coefficient of x in our expanded expression is
"  27 – 6c₂ + c₁,"
"and in the original polynomial x³ + x² – 5, the coefficient of x is 0 (since there is no x term)."
"Since we already found c₂ = 10, please substitute that value into the equation"
  27 – 6c₂ + c₁ = 0
and then solve for c₁. What do you get?
Student: Sure! We need to substitute \(c_2 = 10\) into the equation for the coefficient of \(x\):
\[
27 - 6c_2 + c_1 = 0.
\]
Substituting \(c_2\):
\[
27 - 6(10) + c_1 = 0.
\]
Calculating \(6(10)\):
\[
27 - 60 + c_1 = 0.
\]
Now simplifying:
\[
-33 + c_1 = 0.
\]
To solve for \(c_1\):
\[
c_1 = 33.
\]
"So, we have found that \(c_1 = 33\)."
What should we do next?
Teacher: Good work so far! Now we need to match the constant terms. Look at the constant term in our expansion:
  –27 + 9c₂ – 3c₁ + c₀
"This must equal the constant on the left-hand side of the equation, which is –5 (from x³ + x² – 5). We already know c₂ = 10 and c₁ = 33. "
Please substitute these values into the equation and solve for c₀. What do you get?
Student: Sure! Let's set up the equation for the constant terms. We have:
\[
-27 + 9c_2 - 3c_1 + c_0 = -5.
\]
"Now, substituting \(c_2 = 10\) and \(c_1 = 33\):"
\[
-27 + 9(10) - 3(33) + c_0 = -5.
\]
Calculating the terms:
"1. \(9(10) = 90\),"
2. \(-3(33) = -99\).
Now substituting these values into the equation:
\[
-27 + 90 - 99 + c_0 = -5.
\]
Simplifying the left-hand side:
\[
"-27 + 90 = 63,"
\]
\[
63 - 99 = -36.
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
-36 + c_0 = -5.
\]
To solve for \(c_0\):
\[
c_0 = -5 + 36 = 31.
\]
"Thus, we have found that \(c_0 = 31\)."
Now we have:
"- \(c_2 = 10\),"
"- \(c_1 = 33\),"
- \(c_0 = 31\).
What should we do next?
"Teacher: Great work on finding c₂, c₁, and c₀!"
"Now, the final step is to compute c₂² + c₁² + c₀². We have:"
"  c₂ = 10, c₁ = 33, c₀ = 31."
Could you please calculate 10² + 33² + 31²? Show your work step by step.
Student: Sure! Let's calculate \(c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2\) step by step.
We have:
"- \(c_2 = 10\),"
"- \(c_1 = 33\),"
- \(c_0 = 31\).
"Now, we will calculate each square:"
"1. \(c_2^2 = 10^2 = 100\),"
"2. \(c_1^2 = 33^2 = 1089\),"
3. \(c_0^2 = 31^2 = 961\).
Now we can add these values together:
\[
c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2 = 100 + 1089 + 961.
\]
Calculating the sum:
"1. First, add \(100\) and \(1089\):"
\[
100 + 1089 = 1189.
\]
"2. Now, add \(1189\) and \(961\):"
\[
1189 + 961 = 2150.
\]
"Thus, we find that:"
\[
c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2 = 2150.
\]
"So, the final answer is \(2150\)."
"Teacher: Excellent work! You expanded the expressions, compared coefficients, and solved for c₂, c₁, and c₀ correctly. To summarize:"
• You found that c₂ = 10 from the x² coefficients.
• Substituting c₂ into the x-term equation gave you c₁ = 33.
• Using c₂ and c₁ in the constant term equation led to c₀ = 31.
"• Finally, you computed c₂² + c₁² + c₀² = 10² + 33² + 31² = 100 + 1089 + 961 = 2150."
Your final answer is 2150$
