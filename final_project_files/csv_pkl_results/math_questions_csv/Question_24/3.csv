"Question: There exist constants $c_2,$ $c_1,$ and $c_0$ such that_x000D_"
\[x^3 + x^2 - 5 = (x - 3)^3 + c_2 (x - 3)^2 + c_1 (x - 3) + c_0.\]Find $c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2.$
"Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem. We need to express x³ + x² – 5 in the form (x – 3)³ + c₂(x – 3)² + c₁(x – 3) + c₀. The strategy is to expand the right-hand side, then collect like terms, and finally match the coefficients of corresponding powers of x. Once we have found c₂, c₁, and c₀, we'll compute c₂² + c₁² + c₀²."
Let’s begin with the first step:
Step 1: Expand (x – 3)³. 
Please work on expanding (x – 3)³ and simplify it. What result do you get for the expansion?
"Student: To expand \((x - 3)^3\), we can use the binomial theorem or simply expand it step by step. "
Starting with \((x - 3)^3\):
\[
(x - 3)^3 = (x - 3)(x - 3)(x - 3)
\]
"First, expand \((x - 3)(x - 3)\):"
\[
(x - 3)(x - 3) = x^2 - 6x + 9
\]
"Now, we multiply this result by \((x - 3)\):"
\[
(x^2 - 6x + 9)(x - 3) = x^2(x - 3) - 6x(x - 3) + 9(x - 3)
\]
Calculating each term:
1. \(x^2(x - 3) = x^3 - 3x^2\)
2. \(-6x(x - 3) = -6x^2 + 18x\)
3. \(9(x - 3) = 9x - 27\)
"Now, combine all these results:"
\[
x^3 - 3x^2 - 6x^2 + 18x + 9x - 27 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27
\]
"So, the expansion of \((x - 3)^3\) is:"
\[
(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27
\]
"Now that we have this expansion, what's the next step?"
Teacher: Great job expanding (x – 3)³! Your answer x³ – 9x² + 27x – 27 is correct.
"Now, for the next step, we need to expand the entire expression on the right-hand side of the equation:"
x³ + x² – 5 = (x – 3)³ + c₂ (x – 3)² + c₁ (x – 3) + c₀.
We already expanded (x – 3)³. The next part is to expand (x – 3)². 
Could you please expand (x – 3)² and simplify your answer? What result do you get for that expansion?
"Student: To expand \((x - 3)^2\), we can use the formula for the square of a binomial:"
\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 2 \cdot 3 \cdot x + 3^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9.
\]
"So, the expansion of \((x - 3)^2\) is:"
\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9.
\]
"Now that we have \((x - 3)^2\) expanded, what's the next step?"
Teacher: Excellent work expanding (x – 3)²! Now let's take these expansions and substitute them into the entire equation:
  x³ + x² – 5 = (x – 3)³ + c₂ (x – 3)² + c₁ (x – 3) + c₀.
We already have:
"  (x – 3)³ = x³ – 9x² + 27x – 27, and"
  (x – 3)² = x² – 6x + 9.
"So, our next step is to write out the right-hand side by expanding each term:"
"  c₂·(x – 3)² = c₂(x² – 6x + 9),"
"  c₁·(x – 3)  = c₁·x – 3c₁,"
and then combine these with the expansion of (x – 3)³ and the constant c₀.
"Could you please write out this full expansion, grouping together the like terms (i.e. powers of x)? Take your time to show how you set it up, and then we can work on equating the coefficients together. What expression do you get?"
Student: Student: Sure! Let's substitute the expansions into the right-hand side of the equation:
We have:
\[
x^3 + x^2 - 5 = (x - 3)^3 + c_2 (x - 3)^2 + c_1 (x - 3) + c_0.
\]
Substituting the expansions we found:
1. \((x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27\)
2. \(c_2 (x - 3)^2 = c_2 (x^2 - 6x + 9) = c_2 x^2 - 6c_2 x + 9c_2\)
3. \(c_1 (x - 3) = c_1 x - 3c_1\)
4. \(c_0\) is simply \(c_0\).
"Now, combining these terms, we get:"
\[
x^3 + x^2 - 5 = (x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27) + (c_2 x^2 - 6c_2 x + 9c_2) + (c_1 x - 3c_1) + c_0.
\]
"Now, let's combine like terms on the right-hand side:"
- For \(x^3\): \(1x^3\)
- For \(x^2\): \((-9 + c_2)x^2\)
- For \(x\): \((27 - 6c_2 + c_1)x\)
- For the constant term: \((-27 + 9c_2 - 3c_1 + c_0)\)
"Putting it all together, we have:"
\[
x^3 + x^2 - 5 = x^3 + (-9 + c_2)x^2 + (27 - 6c_2 + c_1)x + (-27 + 9c_2 - 3c_1 + c_0).
\]
"Now, we can equate coefficients from both sides of the equation. This gives us the following system of equations:"
1. For \(x^2\): \(-9 + c_2 = 1\)
2. For \(x\): \(27 - 6c_2 + c_1 = 0\)
3. For the constant term: \(-27 + 9c_2 - 3c_1 + c_0 = -5\)
"Now, we can solve these equations for \(c_2\), \(c_1\), and \(c_0\). Would you like me to proceed with solving this system of equations?"
Teacher: Great job writing out the full expansion and grouping the like terms! Now we have these three equations obtained by equating the coefficients on both sides:
1) For x²: –9 + c₂ = 1  
2) For x: 27 – 6c₂ + c₁ = 0  
3) For the constant term: –27 + 9c₂ – 3c₁ + c₀ = –5
Let’s begin by solving the first equation. 
Step 1: Solve –9 + c₂ = 1 for c₂. What value do you get for c₂?
"Student: To solve the equation \(-9 + c_2 = 1\), we can isolate \(c_2\) by adding 9 to both sides:"
\[
c_2 = 1 + 9 = 10.
\]
"So, we find that \(c_2 = 10\). "
What's the next step? Would you like me to proceed with solving the second equation for \(c_1\)?
Teacher: Great job solving for c₂! You found c₂ = 10.
"Now, let's move on to the next step using the second equation:"
27 – 6c₂ + c₁ = 0.
"Since you already know c₂ = 10, substitute that value into the equation and solve for c₁. What value do you get for c₁?"
"Student: To solve the equation \(27 - 6c_2 + c_1 = 0\), we will substitute \(c_2 = 10\):"
\[
27 - 6(10) + c_1 = 0.
\]
Calculating \(6(10)\):
\[
27 - 60 + c_1 = 0.
\]
Now simplifying this:
\[
-33 + c_1 = 0.
\]
"To isolate \(c_1\), we add 33 to both sides:"
\[
c_1 = 33.
\]
"So, we find that \(c_1 = 33\)."
Shall we proceed to the third equation to find \(c_0\)?
Teacher: You're doing great! Now let's work on the third equation:
–27 + 9c₂ – 3c₁ + c₀ = –5.
We already found c₂ = 10 and c₁ = 33. Please substitute these values into the equation and solve for c₀. What value do you get for c₀?
"Student: Student: To solve the equation \(-27 + 9c_2 - 3c_1 + c_0 = -5\), we will substitute \(c_2 = 10\) and \(c_1 = 33\):"
\[
-27 + 9(10) - 3(33) + c_0 = -5.
\]
Calculating \(9(10)\) and \(-3(33)\):
\[
-27 + 90 - 99 + c_0 = -5.
\]
Now simplifying the left-hand side:
\[
-27 + 90 - 99 = -36.
\]
"So, we have:"
\[
-36 + c_0 = -5.
\]
"To isolate \(c_0\), we add 36 to both sides:"
\[
c_0 = -5 + 36 = 31.
\]
"Thus, we find that \(c_0 = 31\)."
"Now that we have \(c_2 = 10\), \(c_1 = 33\), and \(c_0 = 31\), what should we do next? "
Teacher: Excellent work finding \(c_0\)! Now we have all the constants:
- \(c_2 = 10\)
- \(c_1 = 33\)
- \(c_0 = 31\)
The final step is to compute \(c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2\). 
"Could you calculate \(c_2^2\), \(c_1^2\), and \(c_0^2\), and then find their sum? What do you get?"
"Teacher: Great work obtaining c₂ = 10, c₁ = 33, and c₀ = 31! For the final step, we need to compute c₂² + c₁² + c₀². "
"Step 4: Please calculate c₂² (i.e., 10²), c₁² (i.e., 33²), and c₀² (i.e., 31²), and then add these three numbers together. What sum do you get?"
"Student: To calculate \(c_2^2\), \(c_1^2\), and \(c_0^2\), we will compute each square:"
1. \(c_2^2 = 10^2 = 100\)
2. \(c_1^2 = 33^2 = 1089\)
3. \(c_0^2 = 31^2 = 961\)
"Now, we can add these values together:"
\[
c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2 = 100 + 1089 + 961.
\]
Calculating the sum:
\[
"100 + 1089 = 1189,"
\]
\[
1189 + 961 = 2150.
\]
"Thus, the final result is:"
\[
c_2^2 + c_1^2 + c_0^2 = 2150.
\]
Is there anything else you would like to discuss or clarify?
Teacher: Great work calculating the squares and summing them up! You found:
• c₂² = 10² = 100  
• c₁² = 33² = 1089  
• c₀² = 31² = 961  
And then added these: 100 + 1089 + 961 = 2150.
You've reached the final answer for c₂² + c₁² + c₀². 
Final answer: 2150$
