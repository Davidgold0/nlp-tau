"Question: Find the area of a triangle with side lengths 8, 9, and 9."
"3o-mini: We can solve this problem using Heron's formula. For a triangle with side lengths a, b, and c, first compute the semiperimeter:"
  s = (a + b + c) / 2
"Given a = 8, b = 9, and c = 9:"
  s = (8 + 9 + 9) / 2 = 26 / 2 = 13
Heron's formula for the area A is:
  A = √[s(s − a)(s − b)(s − c)]
Plug in the side lengths:
  A = √[13(13 − 8)(13 − 9)(13 − 9)]
  A = √[13 × 5 × 4 × 4]
  A = √[13 × 5 × 16]
  A = √(1040)
Notice that 1040 can be factored as 16 × 65. Therefore:
  A = √(16 × 65) = 4√65
"Thus, the area of the triangle is 4√65."
