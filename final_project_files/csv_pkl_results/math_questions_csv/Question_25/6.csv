"Question: Find the area of a triangle with side lengths 8, 9, and 9."
"3o-mini: We can use Heron's formula to find the area of a triangle when all side lengths are known. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides a, b, and c is given by:"
"  Area = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)],"
where s is the semiperimeter of the triangle:
  s = (a + b + c) / 2.
"For a triangle with side lengths 8, 9, and 9:"
1. Calculate the semiperimeter:
  s = (8 + 9 + 9) / 2 = 26 / 2 = 13.
2. Substitute the values into Heron’s formula:
  Area = √[13 × (13 - 8) × (13 - 9) × (13 - 9)]
     = √[13 × 5 × 4 × 4]
     = √[13 × 80]
     = √1040.
3. Simplify √1040 by factoring out the perfect square:
"  1040 = 16 × 65,"
"  so, √1040 = √(16 × 65) = √16 × √65 = 4√65."
"Thus, the area of the triangle is 4√65."
