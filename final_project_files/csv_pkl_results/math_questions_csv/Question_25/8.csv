"Question: Find the area of a triangle with side lengths 8, 9, and 9."
"3o-mini: To find the area of a triangle with side lengths 8, 9, and 9, we can use Heron's formula. Heron's formula states that the area (A) is given by:"
  A = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]
"where a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle and s is the semi-perimeter:"
  s = (a + b + c) / 2
Step 1: Calculate the semi-perimeter.
  s = (8 + 9 + 9) / 2 = 26 / 2 = 13
Step 2: Plug the values into Heron's formula.
  A = √[13(13 - 8)(13 - 9)(13 - 9)]
  = √[13 × 5 × 4 × 4]
  = √(13 × 80)
  = √1040
Step 3: Simplify the square root.
"  Since 1040 = 16 × 65, we have:"
  A = √(16 × 65) = √16 × √65 = 4√65
"Thus, the area of the triangle is 4√65 square units."
