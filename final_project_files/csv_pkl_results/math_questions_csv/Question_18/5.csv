"Teacher: Let's begin by understanding the problem. We have a triangle with an area of 27 cm² and a base of 6 cm, and we need to find its height using the area formula of a triangle."
"First, let's recall the formula for the area of a triangle. How would you express the area in terms of the base and the height? Please share your answer for this step."
Student: The formula for the area \( A \) of a triangle in terms of the base \( b \) and the height \( h \) is given by:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
\]
"In this case, the area \( A \) is \( 27 \, \text{cm}^2 \) and the base \( b \) is \( 6 \, \text{cm} \). So we can express it as:"
\[
27 = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times h
\] 
Is that correct?
Teacher: That's correct! You properly set up the equation as 27 = (1/2) × 6 × h. 
"Now, for the next step, can you solve this equation for h? What value do you get for the height?"
"Student: Student: Sure! To solve the equation \( 27 = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times h \), we can first simplify the right side. "
"Calculating \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \) gives us \( 3 \), so the equation becomes:"
\[
27 = 3h
\]
"Next, to isolate \( h \), we can divide both sides by \( 3 \):"
\[
h = \frac{27}{3}
\]
Calculating that gives:
\[
"h = 9 \, \text{cm}"
\]
"So the height \( h \) of triangle \( PQR \) is \( 9 \, \text{cm} \). Is that correct?"
"Teacher: Great work! You correctly used the area formula for a triangle, substituted the given values, and then simplified the equation to solve for h. You computed (1/2) × 6 as 3 and then divided both sides of the equation 27 = 3h by 3 to get h = 27/3, which indeed gives h = 9 cm."
Your final answer is:
9 cm$
