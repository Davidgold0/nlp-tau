"Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem. We have a triangle with an area of 27 cm² and a base of 6 cm, and we need to find its height (h). "
A good first step is to recall the formula for the area of a triangle. Could you tell me which formula you'll use for finding the area of a triangle?
Student: Sure! The formula for the area of a triangle is given by:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
"In this case, the area is \(27\,\text{cm}^2\) and the base is \(6\,\text{cm}\). So we can use this formula to find the height \(h\). Would you like me to substitute the values into the formula?"
Teacher: Great work recalling the formula! Now let's substitute the values we know into that formula. 
"You have: Area = (1/2) × base × height, and the values are: Area = 27 cm² and base = 6 cm. "
Could you please show the substitution step and set up the equation that will help us solve for h?
"Student: Student: Sure! Substituting the values into the formula, we have:"
\[
27 = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times h
\]
"Now, we can simplify the right side of the equation. Would you like me to go ahead and simplify it?"
Teacher: Excellent! You've set up the correct equation:
27 = (1/2) × 6 × h
"Now, for the next step, simplify the right-hand side expression. What do you get when you simplify (1/2) × 6, and what does the equation look like after simplification?"
"Student: Student: When I simplify \(\frac{1}{2} \times 6\), I get \(3\). So the equation now looks like this:"
\[
27 = 3h
\]
Would you like me to solve for \(h\) from this equation?
Teacher: You're doing a great job setting up the equation! Now we have:
27 = 3h
"For the next step, how do you isolate h from this equation? What operation should be applied, and what value will you get for h?"
"Student: Student: To isolate \(h\), I need to divide both sides of the equation by \(3\). So, the operation will be:"
\[
h = \frac{27}{3}
\]
Calculating that gives me:
\[
h = 9
\]
"So the height \(h\) of triangle \(PQR\) is \(9\,\text{cm}\). Is that correct?"
Teacher: Fantastic work! Let's review what we did:
1. We started by recalling the area of a triangle formula: Area = (1/2) × base × height.
"2. We substituted the values, giving us 27 = (1/2) × 6 × h."
"3. Simplifying (1/2) × 6 resulted in 3, so our equation became 27 = 3h."
"4. Dividing both sides by 3 isolated h, leading to h = 9."
"You've followed each step correctly, so the height of the triangle is 9 cm."
