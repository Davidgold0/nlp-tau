Teacher: Great! Let's start by rephrasing the problem in our own words: We have a triangle with an area of 27 cm² and a known base length of 6 cm. We need to find the height of the triangle.
"To approach this problem, here’s a suggested outline of steps:"
1. Recall the formula for the area of a triangle.
2. Substitute the known values (area and base) into the formula.
"3. Solve for the unknown, which is the height h."
"Now, let's take it one step at a time."
Step 1: What is the formula for the area of a triangle? Please share the formula you remember and why it works.
Student: The formula for the area of a triangle is given by:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
"This formula works because it calculates the area by taking half of the product of the base and the height. The base represents one side of the triangle, and the height is the perpendicular distance from the opposite vertex to that base. By multiplying the base by the height, we find the area of a rectangle that would encompass the triangle, and since the triangle is half of that rectangle, we divide by 2. "
"Now that we've recalled the formula, what should we do next?"
"Teacher: Great job explaining the area formula! Now, let's move on to the next step."
"Step 2: Substitute the known values into the formula. We know the area is 27 cm² and the base is 6 cm, and our formula is:"
  Area = (1/2) × base × height
Can you write the equation with these values substituted (using h for height) and simplify it as much as you can?
"Student: Sure! Substituting the known values into the area formula, we have:"
\[
27 = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times h
\]
"Now, let's simplify this equation. First, we can calculate \(\frac{1}{2} \times 6\):"
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3
\]
"So, the equation simplifies to:"
\[
27 = 3 \times h
\]
What should I do next to solve for the height \(h\)?
Teacher: Great job simplifying the equation to 27 = 3h! 
"Now, please solve for h. To do so, you'll want to isolate h by getting rid of the coefficient 3. What operation should you use next? Remember to explain your reasoning as you complete this step."
"Student: Student: To isolate \(h\), I need to get rid of the coefficient 3 that is multiplying \(h\). To do this, I can divide both sides of the equation by 3. This will allow me to solve for \(h\) directly."
"So, I will divide both sides of the equation \(27 = 3h\) by 3:"
\[
h = \frac{27}{3}
\]
Now I can calculate that:
\[
h = 9
\]
"Thus, the height \(h\) of triangle \(PQR\) is \(9\) cm. "
Is there anything else I should consider or clarify?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly solved for h by dividing both sides of the equation by 3 and finding h = 9 cm. 
"Before finalizing, it's always good to review: you used the triangle area formula, substituted the known area and base, simplified the multiplication, and then divided by the coefficient to isolate h. Everything checks out."
"So, the height of triangle PQR is 9 cm."
9$
