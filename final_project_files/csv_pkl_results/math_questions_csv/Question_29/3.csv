Question: Simplify the following expression:   \[2x+3x^2+1-(6-2x-3x^2).\]
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem. We need to simplify the expression: 
  2x + 3x² + 1 − (6 − 2x − 3x²).
A good first step is to eliminate the parentheses. What does that involve? Think about how the minus sign in front of the parentheses affects each term inside.
Could you distribute the minus sign and show me what the expression looks like without parentheses?
"Student: Sure! To eliminate the parentheses, I need to distribute the minus sign to each term inside the parentheses. The expression is:"
\[ 2x + 3x^2 + 1 - (6 - 2x - 3x^2). \]
Distributing the minus sign gives me:
\[ 2x + 3x^2 + 1 - 6 + 2x + 3x^2. \]
So now the expression without parentheses is:
\[ 2x + 3x^2 + 1 - 6 + 2x + 3x^2. \]
What should I do next?
Teacher: Great job distributing the negative sign! Now that we have the expression without parentheses:
  2x + 3x² + 1 − 6 + 2x + 3x²
"the next step is to combine like terms. That means you'll group and add the coefficients for the x² terms together, the x terms together, and the constants together. "
Could you please combine the like terms and show me the resulting expression?
Student: Sure! Let's combine the like terms in the expression:
\[ 2x + 3x^2 + 1 - 6 + 2x + 3x^2. \]
"First, I'll group the like terms:"
1. **x² terms:** \(3x^2 + 3x^2 = 6x^2\)
2. **x terms:** \(2x + 2x = 4x\)
3. **Constant terms:** \(1 - 6 = -5\)
"Now, putting it all together, we have:"
\[ 6x^2 + 4x - 5. \]
So the simplified expression is:
\[ 6x^2 + 4x - 5. \]
Is there anything else you would like me to do with this expression?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly distributed the negative sign and combined like terms. Your final simplified expression is exactly right.
To summarize:
1. You distributed the negative sign to obtain 2x + 3x² + 1 - 6 + 2x + 3x².
2. You then correctly grouped and combined the like terms to achieve the final answer: 6x² + 4x - 5.
6x^2+4x-5$
