"Question: Let $P$ be a plane passing through the origin.  When $\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}$ is projected onto plane $P,$ the result is $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$  When $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}$ is projected onto plane $P,$ what is the result?"
"Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem into clear steps. We know that the projection of a vector onto a plane can be thought of as subtracting the component of the vector that is perpendicular to the plane. Since the plane passes through the origin, the difference between the original vector and its projection is parallel to the normal vector of the plane."
Here's an outline of the steps we'll take:
1. Identify the vector that is perpendicular to the plane by subtracting the given projection from the original vector. This vector will be parallel to the plane’s normal.
2. Use this normal direction to compute the projection of the second vector onto the plane. (Remember that the projection of any vector v onto a plane is given by v minus its component in the direction of the normal.)
3. Calculate the necessary dot products to determine the magnitude of the component in the normal’s direction and carry out that subtraction from the second vector to get its projection on the plane.
"For now, let’s start with the first step. You have the vector (5, 3, 5) and its projection (3, 5, 1). How would you find the vector that is perpendicular to the plane (i.e., the direction of the normal)? Please show your work for this step."
"Student: To find the vector that is perpendicular to the plane, we need to subtract the projection of the vector from the original vector. "
We have the original vector:
\[
\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and its projection onto the plane:
\[
\mathbf{p} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
"Now, we can find the vector that is perpendicular to the plane (the normal vector) by calculating:"
\[
\mathbf{n} = \mathbf{v} - \mathbf{p}
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
\mathbf{n} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 - 3 \\ 3 - 5 \\ 5 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
"So, the vector that is perpendicular to the plane, or the normal vector, is:"
\[
\mathbf{n} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Is this correct? What should I do next?
Teacher: Great work! Your calculation of the normal vector is correct. You correctly found that
"  n = (5, 3, 5) – (3, 5, 1) = (2, –2, 4)."
"Now, let’s move on to the next step. We want to project the vector v' = (4, 0, 7) onto the plane. Recall that the projection of any vector v' onto the plane is given by"
  v_proj = v' – ( (v' · n)/(n · n) ) · n.
"For now, please calculate the dot product v' · n and n · n, and set up the expression for (v' · n)/(n · n). Show your work for this step."
"Student: To find the projection of the vector \(\mathbf{v'} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}\) onto the plane, we need to calculate the dot products \(\mathbf{v'} \cdot \mathbf{n}\) and \(\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{n}\), where \(\mathbf{n} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\)."
"First, let's calculate \(\mathbf{v'} \cdot \mathbf{n}\):"
\[
\mathbf{v'} \cdot \mathbf{n} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = (4)(2) + (0)(-2) + (7)(4)
\]
Calculating this step-by-step:
\[
= 8 + 0 + 28 = 36
\]
"So, we have:"
\[
\mathbf{v'} \cdot \mathbf{n} = 36
\]
"Next, let's calculate \(\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{n}\):"
\[
\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{n} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = (2)(2) + (-2)(-2) + (4)(4)
\]
Calculating this step-by-step:
\[
= 4 + 4 + 16 = 24
\]
"So, we have:"
\[
\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{n} = 24
\]
"Now, we can set up the expression for \(\frac{\mathbf{v'} \cdot \mathbf{n}}{\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{n}}\):"
\[
\frac{\mathbf{v'} \cdot \mathbf{n}}{\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{n}} = \frac{36}{24} = \frac{3}{2}
\]
What should I do next?
Teacher: You've done an excellent job calculating the dot products and setting up the fraction. Now that we have
"  (v' · n)/(n · n) = (36)/(24) = 3/2,"
"we can move to the final step: projecting v' onto the plane. Remember, the formula for the projection of v' onto the plane is:"
  v'_proj = v' – [(v' · n)/(n · n)] · n.
"Using your values, that means:"
"  v'_proj = (4, 0, 7) – (3/2) · (2, –2, 4)."
"Please calculate this subtraction step-by-step: first, compute (3/2) · (2, –2, 4) and then subtract it from (4, 0, 7). Show your work for this step."
"Student: To find the projection of \(\mathbf{v'} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}\) onto the plane, we will first compute \((3/2) \cdot \mathbf{n}\) where \(\mathbf{n} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\)."
Calculating \((3/2) \cdot \mathbf{n}\):
\[
(3/2) \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} (3/2) \cdot 2 \\ (3/2) \cdot -2 \\ (3/2) \cdot 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}
\]
"Now, we will subtract this result from \(\mathbf{v'}\):"
\[
\mathbf{v'}_{proj} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Calculating this step-by-step:
\[
\mathbf{v'}_{proj} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 3 \\ 0 - (-3) \\ 7 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
"Thus, the projection of the vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}\) onto the plane \(P\) is:"
\[
\mathbf{v'}_{proj} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Is this the final answer?
"Teacher: Great job! Your work in every step was correct. You've determined that the normal vector is n = (2, –2, 4). Then you correctly computed (v′ · n)/(n · n) = 36/24 = 3/2, and finally found the projection of v′ = (4, 0, 7) onto the plane by subtracting (3/2)n from v′, which led you to (1, 3, 1)."
"Now that we have discussed all the steps together and confirmed your reasoning at each stage, I can summarize:"
• Start with the projection property: the difference between a vector and its projection is perpendicular to the plane.
"• For the first vector, subtracting its projection gave the normal vector."
"• For the second vector, calculate the dot products to find the component along the normal."
"• Finally, subtract that component from the vector to obtain its projection onto the plane."
Your final answer is:
"(1, 3, 1)$"
