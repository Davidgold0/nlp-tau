"Question: Let $P$ be a plane passing through the origin.  When $\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}$ is projected onto plane $P,$ the result is $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$  When $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}$ is projected onto plane $P,$ what is the result?"
"3o-mini: We are given that the projection of the vector v = (5, 3, 5) onto a plane P through the origin is (3, 5, 1). The difference between v and its projection must be along a vector perpendicular to P. In other words, the vector"
"  v – projection = (5, 3, 5) – (3, 5, 1) = (2, -2, 4)"
is normal (or parallel to the normal) of the plane P.
"Now, let n = (2, -2, 4) be a normal vector to P. Recall that for any vector x, its projection onto the plane P is"
  proj_P(x) = x – [(x • n)/(n • n)] n.
"We wish to find the projection of x = (4, 0, 7) onto the plane. Start by computing the necessary dot products:"
"  x • n = 4•2 + 0•(-2) + 7•4 = 8 + 0 + 28 = 36,"
  n • n = 2² + (-2)² + 4² = 4 + 4 + 16 = 24.
"Now, calculate the projection:"
"  proj_P(x) = (4, 0, 7) – (36/24)(2, -2, 4)"
"         = (4, 0, 7) – (3/2)(2, -2, 4)"
"         = (4, 0, 7) – (3, -3, 6)"
"         = (4 – 3, 0 – (-3), 7 – 6)"
"         = (1, 3, 1)."
"Thus, the projection of (4, 0, 7) onto the plane P is (1, 3, 1)."
