"Question: Let $P$ be a plane passing through the origin.  When $\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}$ is projected onto plane $P,$ the result is $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$  When $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}$ is projected onto plane $P,$ what is the result?"
Teacher: Let's begin by outlining the steps needed to solve this problem:
1. Rephrase the problem:  
"   We have a plane P through the origin. A vector v₁ = [5, 3, 5] projects onto the plane as [3, 5, 1]. The difference between v₁ and its projection gives a vector that is perpendicular to the plane. This perpendicular vector can serve as a normal vector (n) to P."
2. How to find n:  
"   Calculate n = v₁ - projection, which is [5, 3, 5] - [3, 5, 1]."
3. Using the normal vector:  
"   Once you have n, for any vector w = [4, 0, 7] to be projected onto the plane, you can subtract the component of w along n from w. The formula for the projection onto the plane is:  "
   Projection onto P = w - ( (w • n) / (n • n) ) * n
Let’s start with the first step:  
"Calculate the vector n by subtracting [3, 5, 1] from [5, 3, 5]. What do you get?"
"Student: To find the vector \( n \), I will subtract the projection \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) from the original vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\)."
Calculating \( n \):
\[
n = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 - 3 \\ 3 - 5 \\ 5 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
"So, the normal vector \( n \) is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\). "
Is that correct?
"Teacher: Great job! Your calculation for n is correct. Now, let’s move on to the next step. We want to calculate the projection of the vector w = [4, 0, 7] onto the plane. To do this, we first need to find the component of w along the normal vector n."
"We do this by computing the scalar (w • n) / (n • n), where ""•"" denotes the dot product."
Could you please calculate the two dot products:  
"1. w • n, where w = [4, 0, 7] and n = [2, -2, 4], and  "
"2. n • n for n = [2, -2, 4]? "
"Once you have those values, we can move on to the next step."
Student: Sure! Let's calculate the dot products as you instructed.
"1. First, I'll calculate \( w \cdot n \):"
   \[
   w \cdot n = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = (4 \cdot 2) + (0 \cdot -2) + (7 \cdot 4) = 8 + 0 + 28 = 36
   \]
"2. Now, I'll calculate \( n \cdot n \):"
   \[
   n \cdot n = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = (2 \cdot 2) + (-2 \cdot -2) + (4 \cdot 4) = 4 + 4 + 16 = 24
   \]
"So, we have:"
- \( w \cdot n = 36 \)
- \( n \cdot n = 24 \)
Is that correct?
Teacher: Great work on the dot products! You've correctly found that w • n = 36 and n • n = 24.
"Now, let’s move to the next step. We need to find the component of w along the normal vector n by computing"
  (36/24) · n.
"Since 36/24 simplifies, can you first simplify that fraction? Then, multiply n = [2, -2, 4] by the resulting fraction to get the projection of w onto n. What vector do you obtain for (w • n)/(n • n) · n?"
"Student: To simplify the fraction \( \frac{36}{24} \), we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 12:"
\[
\frac{36}{24} = \frac{36 \div 12}{24 \div 12} = \frac{3}{2}
\]
"Now, we need to multiply this result by the normal vector \( n = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \):"
\[
\frac{3}{2} \cdot n = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3}{2} \cdot 2 \\ \frac{3}{2} \cdot -2 \\ \frac{3}{2} \cdot 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}
\]
"So, the vector obtained for \( \frac{(w \cdot n)}{(n \cdot n)} \cdot n \) is \( \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} \)."
Is that correct?
"Teacher: Excellent job simplifying the fraction and carrying out the multiplication! You correctly obtained (w • n)/(n • n) · n = [3, -3, 6]."
"Now, let’s move to the next step: Recall that to find the projection of w = [4, 0, 7] onto the plane, we subtract this vector from w. That is:"
  Projection on P = w - ( (w • n)/(n • n) · n )
"Could you please calculate [4, 0, 7] minus [3, -3, 6]? What vector do you obtain?"
"Student: To find the projection of \( w = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} \) onto the plane, I will subtract the vector \( \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} \) from \( w \):"
\[
\text{Projection on } P = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 3 \\ 0 - (-3) \\ 7 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
"So, the projection of \( \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} \) onto the plane \( P \) is \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \)."
Is that correct?
Teacher: You've done an excellent job working through the problem! Your calculations are correct. To summarize:
"1. You correctly computed the normal vector n = [5, 3, 5] – [3, 5, 1] = [2, -2, 4]."
2. You then found the dot products: w • n = 36 and n • n = 24.
"3. Simplifying 36/24 gave 3/2, and multiplying this with n led to (3/2)·n = [3, -3, 6]."
"4. Finally, subtracting this from w = [4, 0, 7] resulted in [4, 0, 7] – [3, -3, 6] = [1, 3, 1]."
"The final answer is: [1, 3, 1]$"
