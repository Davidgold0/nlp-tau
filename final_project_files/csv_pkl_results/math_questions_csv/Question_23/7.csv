"Question: Let $P$ be a plane passing through the origin.  When $\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}$ is projected onto plane $P,$ the result is $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$  When $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}$ is projected onto plane $P,$ what is the result?"
"3o-mini: Let the normal vector to the plane P be n. Since the plane passes through the origin, the projection of any vector v onto the plane is given by"
"  proj_P(v) = v − proj_n(v),"
where
  proj_n(v) = [(v · n) / (n · n)] n.
"We are told that when v = (5, 3, 5) is projected onto the plane P, the result is (3, 5, 1). This means the ""lost"" part, the component along n, is"
"  (5, 3, 5) − (3, 5, 1) = (2, −2, 4)."
"Since this difference must lie in the direction of n, we can take n = (2, −2, 4) (or any nonzero scalar multiple thereof). For simplicity, we choose to use the vector (1, −1, 2) which is just n scaled by 1/2."
"Now, consider the vector u = (4, 0, 7) whose projection onto the plane we seek. First, compute the dot product of u with our chosen normal vector n = (1, −1, 2):"
  u · n = 4*(1) + 0*(−1) + 7*(2) = 4 + 0 + 14 = 18.
"Next, compute the norm squared of n:"
  n · n = 1² + (−1)² + 2² = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6.
"Thus, the projection of u onto n is"
"  proj_n(u) = (18/6)*(1, −1, 2) = 3*(1, −1, 2) = (3, −3, 6)."
The projection of u onto the plane is then
"  proj_P(u) = u − proj_n(u) = (4, 0, 7) − (3, −3, 6) = (4 − 3, 0 − (−3), 7 − 6) = (1, 3, 1)."
"Therefore, the projection of (4, 0, 7) onto the plane P is"
