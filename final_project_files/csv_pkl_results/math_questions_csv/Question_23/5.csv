"Question: Let $P$ be a plane passing through the origin.  When $\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}$ is projected onto plane $P,$ the result is $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$  When $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}$ is projected onto plane $P,$ what is the result?"
"Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the process. The problem tells us that when the vector (5, 3, 5) is projected onto a plane P through the origin, its projection is (3, 5, 1). One useful observation is that the difference between the given vector and its projection is orthogonal to the plane. In other words, this difference gives us a vector that is parallel to the normal vector of the plane."
Step 1: Find the normal vector. 
"Can you calculate the difference between (5, 3, 5) and (3, 5, 1) to determine a normal vector to the plane?"
"Student: Sure! To find the normal vector to the plane \( P \), we need to calculate the difference between the vector \( \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \) and its projection \( \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \)."
Let's perform the subtraction:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 - 3 \\ 3 - 5 \\ 5 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
"So, the difference is \( \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \). This vector is orthogonal to the plane \( P \), which means it can be considered as a normal vector to the plane."
Would you like me to proceed with the next step using this normal vector?
"Teacher: Great work finding the normal vector, n = (2, -2, 4)! "
"Now, let's move on to the next step: We need to project the vector v = (4, 0, 7) onto the plane P. A good approach is to subtract from v its projection onto the normal vector n. In other words, the projection onto the plane is given by"
  proj_P(v) = v – [(v • n)/(n • n)] n.
"For the next step, please calculate the following:"
1. Find the dot product v • n.
2. Find the dot product n • n.
Go ahead and compute these values. What do you get?
Student: Sure! Let's compute the required dot products step by step.
1. **Calculate the dot product \( v \cdot n \)** where \( v = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( n = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \):
\[
v \cdot n = 4 \cdot 2 + 0 \cdot (-2) + 7 \cdot 4 = 8 + 0 + 28 = 36.
\]
"So, \( v \cdot n = 36 \)."
2. **Calculate the dot product \( n \cdot n \)**:
\[
n \cdot n = 2 \cdot 2 + (-2) \cdot (-2) + 4 \cdot 4 = 4 + 4 + 16 = 24.
\]
"So, \( n \cdot n = 24 \)."
Now we have both dot products:
- \( v \cdot n = 36 \)
- \( n \cdot n = 24 \)
Would you like me to proceed with calculating the projection of \( v \) onto the plane \( P \) using these values?
Teacher: Great job computing the dot products!
"Our next step is to compute the scaling factor by dividing v • n by n • n and then multiplying that scalar by the normal vector n. In other words, calculate"
  (v • n) / (n • n) × n.
"You already found v • n = 36 and n • n = 24, so the scalar is 36/24. Can you simplify 36/24 and then multiply that simplified scalar by n = (2, -2, 4) to find the resulting vector? Please provide your answer for this step."
Student: Sure! Let's simplify the scalar \( \frac{36}{24} \):
\[
\frac{36}{24} = \frac{3}{2}.
\]
"Now, we will multiply this scalar by the normal vector \( n = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \):"
\[
\frac{3}{2} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3}{2} \cdot 2 \\ \frac{3}{2} \cdot (-2) \\ \frac{3}{2} \cdot 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Now we have the vector \( \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} \). 
Would you like me to proceed with the final step to find the projection of \( v \) onto the plane \( P \)?
"Teacher: Excellent work! Now that we have the scaled normal vector (3, -3, 6), the next step is to find the projection of v = (4, 0, 7) onto the plane. Remember, the projection onto the plane, projP(v), is given by"
  projP(v) = v – [(v • n)/(n • n)]n.
"You've just computed [(v • n)/(n • n)]n as (3, -3, 6). "
"For the next step, please subtract this vector from v. In other words, compute"
"  (4, 0, 7) – (3, -3, 6)."
What do you get for the resulting vector?
Student: Sure! Let's perform the subtraction step to find the projection of \( v \) onto the plane \( P \).
We need to calculate:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 3 \\ 0 - (-3) \\ 7 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
"So, the projection of \( \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} \) onto the plane \( P \) is \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \)."
Would you like me to summarize the entire solution or provide any additional information?
"Teacher: Great work! It looks like you've correctly subtracted (3, -3, 6) from (4, 0, 7) to get (1, 3, 1). "
"So, the projection of (4, 0, 7) onto the plane is (1, 3, 1)$"
