3o-mini: We start with the coordinates given by the diagram:
" • A = (0, 0)"
" • B = (4, 4)"
" • C = (12, –4)"
" • D = (4, –4)"
" • P = (4, 0)"
Notice that P is indeed the midpoint of BD since
"  midpoint of B (4, 4) and D (4, –4) = (4, (4 + (–4))/2) = (4, 0)."
"The conditions AP = BP = 4, and the various right angles, also check out with these coordinates."
"To find the perimeter of pentagon ABCDP, we need to sum the lengths of the segments:"
" AB, BC, CD, DP, and PA."
1. Length of AB:
" A = (0, 0) and B = (4, 4)"
  AB = √[(4 – 0)² + (4 – 0)²] = √(16 + 16) = √32 = 4√2.
2. Length of BC:
" B = (4, 4) and C = (12, –4)"
  BC = √[(12 – 4)² + (–4 – 4)²] = √[(8)² + (–8)²] = √(64 + 64) = √128 = 8√2.
3. Length of CD:
" C = (12, –4) and D = (4, –4)"
  CD = √[(4 – 12)² + (–4 – (–4))²] = √[(-8)² + 0²] = √64 = 8.
4. Length of DP:
" D = (4, –4) and P = (4, 0)"
  DP = √[(4 – 4)² + (0 – (–4))²] = √[0² + 4²] = 4.
5. Length of PA:
" P = (4, 0) and A = (0, 0)"
  PA = √[(0 – 4)² + (0 – 0)²] = √[(-4)²] = 4.
Now add all these lengths:
 Perimeter = AB + BC + CD + DP + PA
  = 4√2 + 8√2 + 8 + 4 + 4
  = (4√2 + 8√2) + (8 + 4 + 4)
  = 12√2 + 16.
"Thus, the perimeter of pentagon ABCDP in simple radical form is 16 + 12√2."
