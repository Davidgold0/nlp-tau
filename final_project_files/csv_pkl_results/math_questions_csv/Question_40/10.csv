3o-mini: We begin by assigning coordinates to the points as suggested by the diagram:
"• Let A = (0, 0)."
"• Let B = (4, 4)."
"• Since AP = 4 and P lies on the perpendicular from A to BD, and the given diagram shows P = (4, 0), let P = (4, 0)."
"• P is the midpoint of BD and BP = 4. Since B = (4, 4), the midpoint being (4, 0) implies D = (4, –4)."
"• We are told BD ⟂ DC; with D at (4, –4) this makes DC horizontal. The diagram sets C = (12, –4)."
"Now, verify the other given conditions:"
"1. AP = distance from A = (0, 0) to P = (4, 0) = 4."
"2. BP = distance from B = (4, 4) to P = (4, 0) = 4."
3. AP ⟂ BD: AP is horizontal and BD is vertical.
4. BD ⟂ DC: BD is vertical and DC is horizontal.
"5. AB ⟂ BC: Using A = (0, 0), B = (4, 4), C = (12, –4), a check shows AB has slope 1 and BC has slope (–4–4)/(12–4) = –8/8 = –1, confirming the perpendicularity."
"The pentagon ABCDP has vertices A, B, C, D, P. We compute the side lengths:"
"1. AB: from (0, 0) to (4, 4)"
  Length = √[(4–0)² + (4–0)²] = √(16 + 16) = √32 = 4√2.
"2. BC: from (4, 4) to (12, –4)"
  Length = √[(12–4)² + (–4–4)²] = √(8² + (–8)²) = √(64 + 64) = √128 = 8√2.
"3. CD: from (12, –4) to (4, –4)"
  Length = 12–4 = 8.
"4. DP: from (4, –4) to (4, 0)"
  Length = 0 – (–4) = 4.
"5. PA: from (4, 0) to (0, 0)"
  Length = 4.
"Adding these side lengths, the perimeter is:"
Perimeter = AB + BC + CD + DP + PA
  = 4√2 + 8√2 + 8 + 4 + 4
  = (4√2 + 8√2) + (8 + 4 + 4)
  = 12√2 + 16.
"Thus, in simple radical form, the perimeter of pentagon ABCDP is 16 + 12√2."
