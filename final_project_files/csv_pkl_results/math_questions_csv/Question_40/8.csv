3o-mini: We are given the following points and conditions (with reference to the provided diagram):
"• A = (0,0)  "
"• B = (4,4)  "
"• C = (12,–4)  "
"• D = (4,–4)  "
"• P = (4,0)"
"Notice that P is the midpoint of BD (since (4, (4 + (–4))/2) = (4, 0)), AP = BP = 4, and the various perpendicularity conditions hold as given."
"The pentagon is labeled ABCDP with the vertices in that order: A, B, C, D, and P."
We now compute the side lengths:
1. Side AB:  
"Distance from A(0,0) to B(4,4)  "
= √[(4 – 0)² + (4 – 0)²]  
= √(16 + 16) = √32 = 4√2.
2. Side BC:  
"Distance from B(4,4) to C(12,–4)  "
= √[(12 – 4)² + (–4 – 4)²]  
= √[(8)² + (–8)²]  
= √(64 + 64) = √128 = 8√2.
3. Side CD:  
"Distance from C(12,–4) to D(4,–4)  "
= √[(4 – 12)² + (–4 – (–4))²]  
= √[(-8)² + 0²]  
= √64 = 8.
4. Side DP:  
"Distance from D(4,–4) to P(4,0)  "
= √[(4 – 4)² + (0 – (–4))²]  
= √(0² + 4²) = 4.
5. Side PA:  
"Distance from P(4,0) to A(0,0)  "
= √[(0 – 4)² + (0 – 0)²]  
= √(16 + 0) = 4.
Now add these lengths to get the perimeter:
Perimeter = AB + BC + CD + DP + PA  
= 4√2 + 8√2 + 8 + 4 + 4  
= (4√2 + 8√2) + (8 + 4 + 4)  
= 12√2 + 16.
"Thus, the perimeter of pentagon ABCDP in simple radical form is 16 + 12√2."
