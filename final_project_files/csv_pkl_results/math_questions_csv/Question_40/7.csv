"3o-mini: We are given the pentagon with vertices A, B, C, D, and P in that order, where the coordinates (from the diagram) are: "
"• A = (0, 0)  "
"• B = (4, 4)  "
"• C = (12, –4)  "
"• D = (4, –4)  "
"• P = (4, 0)"
"To find the perimeter of pentagon ABCDP, we calculate the lengths of the sides (in order):"
1. Side AB:  
"Distance from A (0, 0) to B (4, 4) is  "
  AB = √[(4 – 0)² + (4 – 0)²] = √(16 + 16) = √32 = 4√2.
2. Side BC:  
"Distance from B (4, 4) to C (12, –4) is  "
  BC = √[(12 – 4)² + (–4 – 4)²] = √(8² + (–8)²] = √(64 + 64) = √128 = 8√2.
3. Side CD:  
"Distance from C (12, –4) to D (4, –4) is  "
  CD = √[(12 – 4)² + (–4 – (–4))²] = √(8² + 0²) = 8.
4. Side DP:  
"Distance from D (4, –4) to P (4, 0) is  "
  DP = √[(4 – 4)² + (0 – (–4))²] = √(0² + 4²) = 4.
5. Side PA:  
"Distance from P (4, 0) to A (0, 0) is  "
  PA = √[(4 – 0)² + (0 – 0)²] = √(4²) = 4.
"Now, add all these lengths to get the perimeter:"
Perimeter = AB + BC + CD + DP + PA  
  = 4√2 + 8√2 + 8 + 4 + 4  
  = (4√2 + 8√2) + (8 + 4 + 4)  
  = 12√2 + 16.
"Thus, in simple radical form, the perimeter of pentagon ABCDP is 16 + 12√2."
