Question: What is the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6?
"3o-mini: The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Their reciprocals are 1, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6 respectively."
"To find the sum, we add these fractions:"
  1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6
Finding a common denominator (which is 6) gives:
  6/6 + 3/6 + 2/6 + 1/6 = (6 + 3 + 2 + 1) / 6 = 12/6 = 2
"So, the sum of the reciprocals of the factors of 6 is 2."
