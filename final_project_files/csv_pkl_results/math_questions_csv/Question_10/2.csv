Question: What is the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6?
"Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem in our own words. We need to find the sum of the reciprocals of all the natural-number factors (divisors) of 6. For example, if 1 is a factor of 6, its reciprocal is 1/1. "
Hereâ€™s an outline of the steps we could follow:
1. Identify all the natural-number factors of 6.
2. Write the reciprocal of each factor.
3. Add the reciprocals together to get the final result.
What do you think should be our first step? Can you list the natural-number factors of 6?
"Student: Sure! The natural-number factors of 6 are the numbers that divide 6 without leaving a remainder. The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. "
"So, the natural-number factors of 6 are: 1, 2, 3, and 6. "
What should we do next?
Teacher: Great job listing the factors for 6! The next step is to write down the reciprocal of each factor. 
"Can you list the reciprocals for the factors 1, 2, 3, and 6?"
Student: Student: Of course! The reciprocals of the factors we listed are as follows:
- The reciprocal of 1 is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \).
- The reciprocal of 2 is \( \frac{1}{2} \).
- The reciprocal of 3 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- The reciprocal of 6 is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
"So, the reciprocals of the factors 1, 2, 3, and 6 are: 1, \( \frac{1}{2} \), \( \frac{1}{3} \), and \( \frac{1}{6} \)."
What should we do next with these reciprocals?
"Teacher: Great job writing the reciprocals! The next step is to add these reciprocals together. To do that, you'll need to combine the fractions 1, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6. Think about what common denominator you could use and how you would add these fractions together. "
Can you show me how you would add these fractions step by step?
"Student: Student: Sure! To add the fractions \( 1 \), \( \frac{1}{2} \), \( \frac{1}{3} \), and \( \frac{1}{6} \), we first need to find a common denominator. "
"The denominators we have are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is 6. So, we'll use 6 as our common denominator."
"Now, let's rewrite each fraction with the common denominator of 6:"
- \( 1 \) can be rewritten as \( \frac{6}{6} \).
- \( \frac{1}{2} \) can be rewritten as \( \frac{3}{6} \) (since \( 1 \times 3 = 3 \) and \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \)).
- \( \frac{1}{3} \) can be rewritten as \( \frac{2}{6} \) (since \( 1 \times 2 = 2 \) and \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \)).
- \( \frac{1}{6} \) stays as \( \frac{1}{6} \).
Now we have:
- \( \frac{6}{6} + \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{6} \)
"Next, we can add these fractions together:"
\[
\frac{6 + 3 + 2 + 1}{6} = \frac{12}{6}
\]
"Now, we can simplify \( \frac{12}{6} \) to get \( 2 \)."
"So, the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6 is \( 2 \). "
Is that correct?
"Teacher: Excellent work! You correctly identified the factors of 6 as 1, 2, 3, and 6, then wrote their reciprocals as 1, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6, respectively. Next, you found a common denominator of 6, rewrote each fraction, and added them to get (6 + 3 + 2 + 1) / 6 = 12/6, which simplifies to 2."
You've followed all the steps methodically. The final answer is 2$
