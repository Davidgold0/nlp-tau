Question: What is the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6?
"Teacher: Let's start by understanding what the problem is asking. We need to find the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6. To break this down, here’s how we can proceed:"
1. Identify the natural-number factors of 6.
2. Write the reciprocal of each factor.
3. Sum those reciprocals together.
Let’s start with the first step: Can you list all the natural-number factors of 6? Please provide your answer for this step.
"Student: Sure! The natural-number factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6."
"Teacher: Great job! You're correct that the natural-number factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6."
"Now, for the next step, can you write the reciprocal of each of these factors? Please share your work for this next step."
Student: Student: Okay! The reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6 are as follows:
- The reciprocal of 1 is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \).
- The reciprocal of 2 is \( \frac{1}{2} \).
- The reciprocal of 3 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
- The reciprocal of 6 is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
"So, the reciprocals are 1, \( \frac{1}{2} \), \( \frac{1}{3} \), and \( \frac{1}{6} \). What should I do next?"
"Teacher: Excellent work so far! Now that you have the reciprocals—1, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6—let's move on to the next step: adding these four fractions together. "
"Can you set up and calculate the sum 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6? Please show your work, including any way you simplify the addition (like finding a common denominator) for this step."
"Student: Sure! To add the fractions \(1\), \(\frac{1}{2}\), \(\frac{1}{3}\), and \(\frac{1}{6}\), I will first convert all the fractions to have a common denominator. "
"The denominators are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is 6. Now, I will rewrite each term with a denominator of 6:"
- \(1\) can be rewritten as \(\frac{6}{6}\).
- \(\frac{1}{2}\) can be rewritten as \(\frac{3}{6}\) (since \(1 \times 3 = 3\) and \(2 \times 3 = 6\)).
- \(\frac{1}{3}\) can be rewritten as \(\frac{2}{6}\) (since \(1 \times 2 = 2\) and \(3 \times 2 = 6\)).
- \(\frac{1}{6}\) remains \(\frac{1}{6}\).
"Now, I can add these fractions together:"
\[
\frac{6}{6} + \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{6 + 3 + 2 + 1}{6} = \frac{12}{6} = 2.
\]
"So, the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6 is \(2\)."
Teacher: You've done a fantastic job working through the problem step by step! I reviewed your work:
"• You correctly identified that the natural-number factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.  "
"• You then found their reciprocals as 1, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6.  "
"• Finally, you successfully added them by rewriting each term with a common denominator of 6:"
  6/6 + 3/6 + 2/6 + 1/6 = (6 + 3 + 2 + 1)/6 = 12/6 = 2.
Your final answer is correct.
