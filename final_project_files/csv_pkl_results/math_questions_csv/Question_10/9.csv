Question: What is the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6?
"3o-mini: The natural-number factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Their reciprocals are 1, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6, respectively. Adding these together:"
1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6
"To combine the fractions, you can use a common denominator (which is 6):"
1 = 6/6  
1/2 = 3/6  
1/3 = 2/6  
1/6 = 1/6  
Now add them:
6/6 + 3/6 + 2/6 + 1/6 = (6 + 3 + 2 + 1)/6 = 12/6 = 2
"So, the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6 is 2."
