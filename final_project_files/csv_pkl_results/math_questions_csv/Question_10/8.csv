Question: What is the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6?
"3o-mini: The natural-number factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Their reciprocals are:"
  1/1 = 1  
  1/2  
  1/3  
  1/6
"To find the sum, we add them:"
  1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6
"To add these fractions, we use the common denominator 6:"
  (6/6) + (3/6) + (2/6) + (1/6) = (6 + 3 + 2 + 1) / 6 = 12/6 = 2
"Thus, the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6 is 2."
