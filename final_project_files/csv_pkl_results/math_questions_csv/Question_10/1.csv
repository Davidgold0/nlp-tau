Question: What is the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6?
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem. We need to find the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6. 
Step 1: Identify all the natural-number factors of 6. 
Can you list the factors of 6? Please provide only this step’s answer first.
"Student: The natural-number factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6."
"Teacher: Great job! You correctly identified the natural-number factors of 6 as 1, 2, 3, and 6."
"Now, let’s move on to the next step: finding the reciprocals of these factors. Could you determine the reciprocal of each factor and provide them one by one (or all together) as your answer for this step?"
Student: The reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6 are:
- The reciprocal of 1 is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \)
- The reciprocal of 2 is \( \frac{1}{2} \)
- The reciprocal of 3 is \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- The reciprocal of 6 is \( \frac{1}{6} \)
"So, the reciprocals are 1, \( \frac{1}{2} \), \( \frac{1}{3} \), and \( \frac{1}{6} \)."
"Teacher: Great work! You've correctly identified the reciprocals of the factors as 1, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6."
"Now let's move on to the next step: summing these reciprocals. To complete this step, you need to add 1, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6 together. Could you please calculate this sum? Take your time to show your work step by step, and let's check it together."
"Student: Student: To sum the reciprocals \( 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \) and \( \frac{1}{6} \), I need to find a common denominator. "
"The least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 1, 2, 3, and 6 is 6. So, I will rewrite each term with a denominator of 6:"
- \( 1 = \frac{6}{6} \)
- \( \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{6} \)
- \( \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{6} \)
- \( \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{6} \)
Now I can add these fractions together:
\[
\frac{6}{6} + \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{6 + 3 + 2 + 1}{6} = \frac{12}{6}
\]
"Finally, simplifying \( \frac{12}{6} \) gives me 2. "
"So, the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6 is 2."
Teacher: Excellent work on adding the fractions correctly! You found that the sum is 2. 
To summarize our process: 
"1. We identified the natural-number factors of 6 as 1, 2, 3, and 6."
"2. We then found their reciprocals as 1, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6."
"3. Lastly, we added these reciprocals by rewriting them with a common denominator, resulting in 6/6 + 3/6 + 2/6 + 1/6 = 12/6, which simplifies to 2."
The final answer is 2$
