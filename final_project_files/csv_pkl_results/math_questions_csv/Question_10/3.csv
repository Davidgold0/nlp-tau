Question: What is the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6?
"Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem. We want to find the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6. To do that, we can break the task into a few clear steps:"
1. Identify all the natural-number factors of 6.
2. Write the reciprocal of each factor.
3. Sum these reciprocals.
Let's begin with step 1. Could you list all the natural-number factors of 6?
"Student: Sure! The natural-number factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Would you like me to move on to step 2 and write the reciprocal of each factor?"
Teacher: Great job listing the factors of 6! Now let's move on to step 2.
"Step 2: Write the reciprocal for each factor. Remember, the reciprocal of a number n is 1 divided by n."
"Could you please list the reciprocals for 1, 2, 3, and 6?"
Student: Student: Of course! Here are the reciprocals for each of the factors:
- The reciprocal of 1 is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \)
- The reciprocal of 2 is \( \frac{1}{2} \)
- The reciprocal of 3 is \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- The reciprocal of 6 is \( \frac{1}{6} \)
"So, the reciprocals are: 1, \( \frac{1}{2} \), \( \frac{1}{3} \), and \( \frac{1}{6} \). Would you like me to move on to step 3 and sum these reciprocals?"
"Teacher: Great work with step 2! Now let's move on to step 3: We need to sum the reciprocals you listed: 1, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6."
Could you please perform the addition of these fractions (say by finding a common denominator or any method you prefer) and provide the resulting sum?
"Student: Sure! To sum the fractions \(1\), \( \frac{1}{2} \), \( \frac{1}{3} \), and \( \frac{1}{6} \), I will first find a common denominator. The least common multiple of the denominators 1, 2, 3, and 6 is 6."
"Now, I will convert each fraction to have a denominator of 6:"
- \(1 = \frac{6}{6}\)
- \( \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{6}\) (because \(1 \times 3 = 3\) and \(2 \times 3 = 6\))
- \( \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{6}\) (because \(1 \times 2 = 2\) and \(3 \times 2 = 6\))
- \( \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{6}\)
"Now, I can add these fractions together:"
\[
\frac{6}{6} + \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{6 + 3 + 2 + 1}{6} = \frac{12}{6} = 2
\]
"So, the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6 is \(2\). Would you like me to go over any part of the process?"
Teacher: You've done a great job working through all the steps! To summarize:
"• First, you identified the natural-number factors of 6 as 1, 2, 3, and 6."
"• Then, you correctly wrote the reciprocals: 1, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6."
"• Finally, you found a common denominator (6) and added the fractions to get the total sum of 12/6, which simplifies to 2."
Final answer: 2$
