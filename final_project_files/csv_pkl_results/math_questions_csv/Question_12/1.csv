Question: Simplify_x000D_
\[\cos^2 x + \cos^2 \left( \frac{\pi}{3} + x \right) + \cos^2 \left( \frac{\pi}{3} -  x \right).\]
Teacher: Let's begin by understanding the problem and outlining the steps needed.
We need to simplify the expression:
  cos² x + cos²(x + π/3) + cos²(x – π/3).
One effective approach is to:
1. Write cos(x + π/3) and cos(x – π/3) explicitly using the cosine addition formula:  
  cos(a ± b) = cos a cos b ∓ sin a sin b.
2. Substitute known values: cos(π/3) = 1/2 and sin(π/3) = √3/2.
3. Square the results to get expressions for cos²(x + π/3) and cos²(x – π/3).
4. Add these to cos² x and simplify the sum using algebra and trigonometric identities (such as the Pythagorean identity sin² x + cos² x = 1).
Let's start with the first step: Write out the expression for cos(x + π/3) using the cosine addition formula. 
Could you please show me how you would express cos(x + π/3) using the formula and then substitute the values for cos(π/3) and sin(π/3)?
"Student: Sure! To express \(\cos(x + \frac{\pi}{3})\) using the cosine addition formula, we start with:"
\[
\cos(x + \frac{\pi}{3}) = \cos x \cos \frac{\pi}{3} - \sin x \sin \frac{\pi}{3}.
\]
"Now, substituting the known values for \(\cos(\frac{\pi}{3})\) and \(\sin(\frac{\pi}{3})\):"
- \(\cos(\frac{\pi}{3}) = \frac{1}{2}\)
- \(\sin(\frac{\pi}{3}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\)
"So, we can substitute these values into the expression:"
\[
\cos(x + \frac{\pi}{3}) = \cos x \cdot \frac{1}{2} - \sin x \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\cos(x + \frac{\pi}{3}) = \frac{1}{2} \cos x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x.
\]
"Now, could you guide me on what the next step is? Should I move on to expressing \(\cos(x - \frac{\pi}{3})\) in a similar way?"
"Teacher: Great work! You've successfully expressed cos(x + π/3) using the addition formula. Now for the next step, we need to express cos(x – π/3). Can you use the cosine subtraction formula (cos(a – b) = cos a cos b + sin a sin b) and substitute the known values for cos(π/3) and sin(π/3) to write the expression for cos(x – π/3)? Please show your work on this step."
"Student: Student: Sure! To express \(\cos(x - \frac{\pi}{3})\) using the cosine subtraction formula, we start with:"
\[
\cos(x - \frac{\pi}{3}) = \cos x \cos \frac{\pi}{3} + \sin x \sin \frac{\pi}{3}.
\]
"Now, substituting the known values for \(\cos(\frac{\pi}{3})\) and \(\sin(\frac{\pi}{3})\):"
- \(\cos(\frac{\pi}{3}) = \frac{1}{2}\)
- \(\sin(\frac{\pi}{3}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\)
"So, we can substitute these values into the expression:"
\[
\cos(x - \frac{\pi}{3}) = \cos x \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \sin x \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\cos(x - \frac{\pi}{3}) = \frac{1}{2} \cos x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x.
\]
"Now that we have both expressions for \(\cos(x + \frac{\pi}{3})\) and \(\cos(x - \frac{\pi}{3})\), what should I do next? Should I proceed to square both of these expressions?"
Teacher: Excellent work! The next step is indeed to square both expressions for cos(x + π/3) and cos(x - π/3).
"Remember, you now have:"
" cos(x + π/3) = (1/2) cos x − (√3/2) sin x, and"
 cos(x - π/3) = (1/2) cos x + (√3/2) sin x.
"Please square each expression separately. That is, compute cos²(x + π/3) and cos²(x - π/3). Once you’ve squared them, write down the resulting expressions. Could you show your work for these squares?"
Student: Sure! Let's start by squaring each expression.
1. **Squaring \(\cos(x + \frac{\pi}{3})\)**:
   \[
   \cos^2\left(x + \frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{2} \cos x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x\right)^2
   \]
   Using the formula \((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\):
   \[
   = \left(\frac{1}{2} \cos x\right)^2 - 2\left(\frac{1}{2} \cos x\right)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x\right) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x\right)^2
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{1}{4} \cos^2 x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x + \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 x
   \]
2. **Squaring \(\cos(x - \frac{\pi}{3})\)**:
   \[
   \cos^2\left(x - \frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{2} \cos x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x\right)^2
   \]
   Again using the formula \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\):
   \[
   = \left(\frac{1}{2} \cos x\right)^2 + 2\left(\frac{1}{2} \cos x\right)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x\right) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x\right)^2
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{1}{4} \cos^2 x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x + \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 x
   \]
"Now, we have the squared expressions:"
- \(\cos^2\left(x + \frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \cos^2 x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x + \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 x\)
- \(\cos^2\left(x - \frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \cos^2 x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x + \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 x\)
What should I do next with these squared expressions?
"Teacher: Great job with squaring the expressions! Now, the next step is to add all three terms in the original expression together. You have:"
 cos²x  
 + [cos²(x + π/3)] = (1/4)cos²x – (√3/2)cos x sin x + (3/4)sin²x  
 + [cos²(x – π/3)] = (1/4)cos²x + (√3/2)cos x sin x + (3/4)sin²x
"Please add these three expressions together. When you do that, take care to combine like terms (notice any cancellation that might occur). Could you show me how you'd combine and simplify these terms?"
Student: Sure! Let's add the three expressions together step by step.
We have:
1. \(\cos^2 x\)
2. \(\cos^2\left(x + \frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \cos^2 x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x + \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 x\)
3. \(\cos^2\left(x - \frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \cos^2 x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x + \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 x\)
"Now, let's add these together:"
\[
\cos^2 x + \left(\frac{1}{4} \cos^2 x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x + \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 x\right) + \left(\frac{1}{4} \cos^2 x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x + \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 x\right)
\]
"Now, let's combine like terms:"
1. **For \(\cos^2 x\)**:
   \[
   \cos^2 x + \frac{1}{4} \cos^2 x + \frac{1}{4} \cos^2 x = \cos^2 x + \frac{1}{2} \cos^2 x = \frac{2}{2} \cos^2 x + \frac{1}{2} \cos^2 x = \frac{3}{2} \cos^2 x
   \]
2. **For \(\sin^2 x\)**:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 x + \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 x = \frac{3}{2} \sin^2 x
   \]
3. **For \(\cos x \sin x\)**:
"   The terms \(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x\) and \(+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x\) cancel each other out, giving:"
   \[
   -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x = 0
   \]
"Now, combining everything together, we get:"
\[
\frac{3}{2} \cos^2 x + \frac{3}{2} \sin^2 x
\]
"Next, we can factor out \(\frac{3}{2}\):"
\[
\frac{3}{2} (\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x)
\]
"Using the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x = 1\), we find:"
\[
\frac{3}{2} \cdot 1 = \frac{3}{2}
\]
"So, the simplified expression is:"
\[
\frac{3}{2}
\]
