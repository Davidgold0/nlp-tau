Question: Simplify_x000D_
\[\cos^2 x + \cos^2 \left( \frac{\pi}{3} + x \right) + \cos^2 \left( \frac{\pi}{3} -  x \right).\]
Teacher: Let's begin by restating the problem in our own words: We need to simplify the expression
  cos²x + cos²(π/3 + x) + cos²(π/3 − x).
A good first step is to express the terms cos(π/3 ± x) using the cosine addition formulas. How would you write cos(π/3 + x) and cos(π/3 − x) using the formulas for cosine of a sum and difference? (Remember: cos(A ± B) = cos A cos B ∓ sin A sin B.) Please provide your expression for one of these terms.
"Student: Sure! To express \(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3} + x\right)\) using the cosine addition formula, we can use:"
\[
\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B.
\]
"In this case, \(A = \frac{\pi}{3}\) and \(B = x\). So we have:"
\[
\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3} + x\right) = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \cos(x) - \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \sin(x).
\]
"Now, we know that:"
\[
\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
"Substituting these values in, we get:"
\[
\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3} + x\right) = \frac{1}{2} \cos(x) - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin(x).
\]
Would you like me to do the same for \(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3} - x\right)\)?
"Teacher: Great job expressing cos(π/3 + x) using the cosine addition formula! Now, please try to express cos(π/3 − x) using the cosine difference formula. Remember that cos(A − B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B, and use the same values for cos(π/3) and sin(π/3). What expression do you get for cos(π/3 − x)?"
"Student: Sure! To express \(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3} - x\right)\) using the cosine difference formula, we can use:"
\[
\cos(A - B) = \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B.
\]
"In this case, \(A = \frac{\pi}{3}\) and \(B = x\). So we have:"
\[
\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3} - x\right) = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \cos(x) + \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \sin(x).
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
"\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},"
\]
we get:
\[
\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3} - x\right) = \frac{1}{2} \cos(x) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin(x).
\]
Now we can substitute both expressions for \(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3} + x\right)\) and \(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3} - x\right)\) back into the original equation. Would you like me to proceed with that?
"Teacher: Great work on finding both expressions! Now, let's move on to the next step. We need to substitute the expressions for cos(π/3 + x) and cos(π/3 − x) into the original expression:"
  cos²x + cos²(π/3 + x) + cos²(π/3 − x).
"Remember, we have:"
  cos(π/3 + x) = (1/2) cos x – (√3/2) sin x  
  cos(π/3 − x) = (1/2) cos x + (√3/2) sin x
Your next step is to substitute these expressions into the original formula. Can you show me how you’d write the resulting expression before simplifying?
Student: Sure! Let's substitute the expressions for \(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3} + x\right)\) and \(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3} - x\right)\) into the original expression:
\[
\cos^2 x + \cos^2\left(\frac{\pi}{3} + x\right) + \cos^2\left(\frac{\pi}{3} - x\right).
\]
We know:
\[
\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3} + x\right) = \frac{1}{2} \cos x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x
\]
and
\[
\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{3} - x\right) = \frac{1}{2} \cos x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x.
\]
"Now, substituting these into the expression, we have:"
\[
\cos^2 x + \left(\frac{1}{2} \cos x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2} \cos x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x\right)^2.
\]
Now we can simplify each of the squared terms. Would you like me to continue with that?
"Teacher: Excellent work reaching this point! Now that we've substituted, our expression looks like this:"
  cos²x + [ (⅟2 cos x – √3⁄2 sin x)² ] + [ (⅟2 cos x + √3⁄2 sin x)² ].
The next step is to expand the squared terms. Let's start with the first one: (⅟2 cos x – √3⁄2 sin x)². Remember that (a – b)² = a² – 2ab + b².
Could you go ahead and expand (⅟2 cos x – √3⁄2 sin x)²? Please show each part of your expansion.
"Student: Sure! To expand the expression \(\left(\frac{1}{2} \cos x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x\right)^2\), we will use the formula for the square of a binomial:"
\[
(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2.
\]
"In our case, we have:"
- \(a = \frac{1}{2} \cos x\)
- \(b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x\)
"Now, let's calculate each part of the expansion:"
1. **Calculate \(a^2\)**:
   \[
   a^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2} \cos x\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \cos^2 x.
   \]
2. **Calculate \(b^2\)**:
   \[
   b^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 x.
   \]
3. **Calculate \(-2ab\)**:
   \[
   -2ab = -2 \left(\frac{1}{2} \cos x\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x.
   \]
"Putting it all together, we have:"
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2} \cos x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \cos^2 x + \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x.
\]
"Would you like me to expand the second squared term, \(\left(\frac{1}{2} \cos x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x\right)^2\) next?"
"Teacher: Great job expanding the first squared term! Now, let's work on the second squared term:"
  (½ cos x + (√3)/2 sin x)²
Recall that (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b². Can you please expand this expression based on that formula? Go ahead and show each part of your expansion.
"Student: Sure! To expand the expression \(\left(\frac{1}{2} \cos x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x\right)^2\), we will use the formula for the square of a binomial:"
\[
(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.
\]
"In this case, we have:"
- \(a = \frac{1}{2} \cos x\)
- \(b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x\)
"Now, let's calculate each part of the expansion:"
1. **Calculate \(a^2\)**:
   \[
   a^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2} \cos x\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \cos^2 x.
   \]
2. **Calculate \(b^2\)**:
   \[
   b^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 x.
   \]
3. **Calculate \(2ab\)**:
   \[
   2ab = 2 \left(\frac{1}{2} \cos x\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x.
   \]
"Putting it all together, we have:"
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2} \cos x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin x\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \cos^2 x + \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x.
\]
"Now that we have expanded both squared terms, would you like me to combine them with the \(\cos^2 x\) term from the original expression?"
"Teacher: Excellent work expanding both squared terms! Now, let's combine the results with the cos²x term in the original expression."
Recall we have:
  cos²x + [⅟4 cos²x + ¾ sin²x – (√3/2) cos x sin x] + [⅟4 cos²x + ¾ sin²x + (√3/2) cos x sin x].
"Your next task is to combine like terms from these three parts. Notice what happens with the cos x sin x terms, and then add the cos²x and sin²x terms appropriately. Could you show how you would combine these terms and simplify the expression?"
Student: Sure! Let's combine the terms from the expanded expression:
\[
\cos^2 x + \left(\frac{1}{4} \cos^2 x + \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x\right) + \left(\frac{1}{4} \cos^2 x + \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x\right).
\]
"Now, let's combine the like terms:"
1. **Combine the \(\cos^2 x\) terms**:
   - From the first term: \(\cos^2 x\)
   - From the second term: \(\frac{1}{4} \cos^2 x\)
   - From the third term: \(\frac{1}{4} \cos^2 x\)
"   So, we have:"
   \[
   \cos^2 x + \frac{1}{4} \cos^2 x + \frac{1}{4} \cos^2 x = \cos^2 x + \frac{1}{2} \cos^2 x = \frac{3}{2} \cos^2 x.
   \]
2. **Combine the \(\sin^2 x\) terms**:
   - From the second term: \(\frac{3}{4} \sin^2 x\)
   - From the third term: \(\frac{3}{4} \sin^2 x\)
"   So, we have:"
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 x + \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 x = \frac{3}{2} \sin^2 x.
   \]
3. **Combine the \(\cos x \sin x\) terms**:
   - From the second term: \(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x\)
   - From the third term: \(+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x\)
"   So, we have:"
   \[
   -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos x \sin x = 0.
   \]
"Now, putting it all together, we get:"
\[
\frac{3}{2} \cos^2 x + \frac{3}{2} \sin^2 x.
\]
We can factor out \(\frac{3}{2}\):
\[
\frac{3}{2} (\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x).
\]
"Using the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x = 1\), we finally have:"
\[
\frac{3}{2} \cdot 1 = \frac{3}{2}.
\]
"Thus, the simplified expression is:"
\[
\frac{3}{2}.
\]
Would you like to discuss anything further about this problem?
Teacher: Great job working through the steps! To summarize:
• We began by using the cosine addition and subtraction formulas to rewrite cos(π/3 + x) and cos(π/3 − x) in terms of cos x and sin x.
• Then we substituted those expressions into the original formula: cos² x + cos²(π/3 + x) + cos²(π/3 − x).
"• Next, we expanded the squares, carefully applying the formulas (a ± b)² = a² ± 2ab + b²."
"• After expanding, we combined like terms: the cos x sin x terms canceled out, and the cos² x and sin² x terms combined to form a multiple of (cos² x + sin² x), which equals 1 by the Pythagorean identity."
• This ultimately simplified the expression to (3/2)(cos² x + sin² x) = 3/2.
"Thus, the final simplified expression is:"
3/2$
