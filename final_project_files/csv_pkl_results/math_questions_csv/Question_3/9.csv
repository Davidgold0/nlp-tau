"Question: The owners of a house that is assessed at $\$120,\!000$ pay $\$3,\!000$ in taxes. At the same rate, what is the tax, in dollars, for a house assessed at $\$160,\!000$?"
"3o-mini: To find the tax on the house assessed at $160,000, first determine the tax rate from the given information:"
"The tax rate = Tax / Assessed Value = $3,000 / $120,000 = 0.025."
"Now, apply this rate to the $160,000 house:"
"Tax = 0.025 Ã— $160,000 = $4,000."
"Thus, the tax on the $160,000 house is $4,000."
