"Question: The owners of a house that is assessed at $\$120,\!000$ pay $\$3,\!000$ in taxes. At the same rate, what is the tax, in dollars, for a house assessed at $\$160,\!000$?"
Teacher: Let's break down the problem step by step before we find the final answer.
Rephrasing the problem in our own words:
"• We know that a house with an assessed value of $120,000 pays $3,000 in taxes."
"• We need to find the tax for a house assessed at $160,000 using the same rate."
Here's an outline of the steps needed:
1. Determine the tax rate by finding the ratio of tax to assessed value for the first house.
"2. Use this rate to calculate the tax for the $160,000 assessed house."
"Let's begin with step 1: Could you calculate the tax rate by dividing the tax ($3,000) by the assessed value ($120,000)? Please show your work for this step."
"Student: Sure! To find the tax rate, we can divide the tax amount by the assessed value of the first house."
The formula for the tax rate is:
\[
\text{Tax Rate} = \frac{\text{Tax}}{\text{Assessed Value}}
\]
Plugging in the values we have:
\[
"\text{Tax Rate} = \frac{3,000}{120,000}"
\]
"Now, let's calculate this:"
\[
"\text{Tax Rate} = \frac{3,000 \div 3,000}{120,000 \div 3,000} = \frac{1}{40}"
\]
"So, the tax rate is \(\frac{1}{40}\) or 0.025 when expressed as a decimal. "
Is that correct?
Teacher: Great job! Your calculation and reasoning for the tax rate is correct; it is indeed 1/40 (or 0.025). 
"Now, let's move on to the next step: Using this tax rate, can you find the tax for a house assessed at $160,000? Please show your work for this calculation."
"Student: Sure! To find the tax for a house assessed at $160,000 using the tax rate we calculated, we can use the same formula:"
\[
\text{Tax} = \text{Tax Rate} \times \text{Assessed Value}
\]
"We already found the tax rate to be \(\frac{1}{40}\) or 0.025, and now we will plug in the assessed value of $160,000:"
\[
"\text{Tax} = \frac{1}{40} \times 160,000"
\]
"Now, let's calculate this:"
\[
"\text{Tax} = \frac{160,000}{40}"
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
"\text{Tax} = 4,000"
\]
"So, the tax for a house assessed at $160,000 is \(\$4,000\). "
Is that correct?
"Teacher: Excellent work! Your computation is correct. You correctly multiplied the tax rate (1/40 or 0.025) by the assessed value of $160,000 to get $4,000. "
To summarize our process:
"1. We computed the tax rate as 3,000 ÷ 120,000 = 1/40 (0.025)."
"2. We then used this rate to find the tax for the $160,000 house by calculating 1/40 × 160,000 = 4,000."
The final answer is 4000$
