"Question: The owners of a house that is assessed at $\$120,\!000$ pay $\$3,\!000$ in taxes. At the same rate, what is the tax, in dollars, for a house assessed at $\$160,\!000$?"
"3o-mini: We're given that a house assessed at $120,000 has a corresponding tax of $3,000. This means the tax rate is 3,000 / 120,000, which simplifies to 0.025 (or 2.5%)."
"For a house assessed at $160,000, the tax is calculated as 160,000 multiplied by 0.025:"
"Tax = 160,000 Ã— 0.025 = $4,000."
"So, the tax for the house assessed at $160,000 is $4,000."
