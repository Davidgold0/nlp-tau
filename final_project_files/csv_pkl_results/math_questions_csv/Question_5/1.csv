"Question: Given that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the roots of $x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0,$ find $5 \alpha^4 + 12 \beta^3.$"
Teacher: Let’s start by breaking the problem into manageable steps. 
"The question is: “Given that α and β are the roots of x² – 2x – 1 = 0, find 5α⁴ + 12β³.”"
"First, we need to understand the relationship between the roots of a quadratic equation and its coefficients. "
"Step 1: Recall that for a quadratic equation of the form x² + Bx + C = 0, the sum of the roots is –B and the product of the roots is C. "
"For our equation, x² – 2x – 1 = 0, what are the values of α + β and αβ? "
Please calculate those and share your answer for this step.
"Student: To find the values of \( \alpha + \beta \) and \( \alpha \beta \) for the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0 \), we can use the relationships provided by the coefficients of the equation."
For the equation \( x^2 + Bx + C = 0 \):
- The sum of the roots \( \alpha + \beta = -B \).
- The product of the roots \( \alpha \beta = C \).
"In our case, we have:"
- \( B = -2 \)
- \( C = -1 \)
"Now, applying the relationships:"
1. \( \alpha + \beta = -(-2) = 2 \)
2. \( \alpha \beta = -1 \)
"So, we have:"
- \( \alpha + \beta = 2 \)
- \( \alpha \beta = -1 \)
"Is that correct, Teacher?"
Teacher: That's correct! The sum is 2 and the product is –1.
"Now, let's move to the next step. Since α is a root of the quadratic equation, it satisfies α² – 2α – 1 = 0, which means we can write α² = 2α + 1."
"Next, we're looking to find expressions for higher powers of α (and later β) so that we can compute 5α⁴ + 12β³. Let’s start by finding α³."
"Using the fact that α² = 2α + 1, how can you find an expression for α³ in terms of α? (Hint: Multiply both sides of the expression for α² by α.) Please work this step out and share your answer."
"Student: To find an expression for \( \alpha^3 \) in terms of \( \alpha \), we start from the equation we derived earlier:"
\[
\alpha^2 = 2\alpha + 1.
\]
"Now, we multiply both sides of this equation by \( \alpha \):"
\[
\alpha^3 = \alpha \cdot \alpha^2.
\]
"Substituting the expression for \( \alpha^2 \) into this equation, we have:"
\[
\alpha^3 = \alpha(2\alpha + 1).
\]
Distributing \( \alpha \) gives us:
\[
\alpha^3 = 2\alpha^2 + \alpha.
\]
"Now, we can substitute \( \alpha^2 \) again using the expression we found earlier:"
\[
\alpha^3 = 2(2\alpha + 1) + \alpha.
\]
Simplifying this:
\[
\alpha^3 = 4\alpha + 2 + \alpha = 5\alpha + 2.
\]
So we have:
\[
\alpha^3 = 5\alpha + 2.
\]
"Is that correct, Teacher?"
Teacher: Good job on finding α³ = 5α + 2!
"Now, let's move to the next step: finding an expression for α⁴ in terms of α."
"Remember that α⁴ = α · α³. Using the expression you just found for α³, can you write an expression for α⁴ and simplify it using the relation α² = 2α + 1? "
Please work out this step and share your answer.
"Student: To find an expression for \( \alpha^4 \) in terms of \( \alpha \), we start with the expression we derived for \( \alpha^3 \):"
\[
\alpha^3 = 5\alpha + 2.
\]
"Now, we can express \( \alpha^4 \) as:"
\[
\alpha^4 = \alpha \cdot \alpha^3.
\]
Substituting the expression for \( \alpha^3 \) into this equation gives us:
\[
\alpha^4 = \alpha(5\alpha + 2).
\]
Distributing \( \alpha \) yields:
\[
\alpha^4 = 5\alpha^2 + 2\alpha.
\]
Now we can use the relation \( \alpha^2 = 2\alpha + 1 \) to substitute for \( \alpha^2 \):
\[
\alpha^4 = 5(2\alpha + 1) + 2\alpha.
\]
Simplifying this:
\[
\alpha^4 = 10\alpha + 5 + 2\alpha = 12\alpha + 5.
\]
"So, we have:"
\[
\alpha^4 = 12\alpha + 5.
\]
"Is that correct, Teacher?"
Teacher: That's correct! You've determined that α⁴ = 12α + 5.
"Now, let's work on finding β³ in terms of β. Recall that β also satisfies the equation β² – 2β – 1 = 0, so we can rearrange it as β² = 2β + 1."
"Using the same idea as before, how can you express β³ in terms of β? Please use the relation β² = 2β + 1 by multiplying both sides by β, and then simplify. What expression do you obtain for β³?"
"Student: To find an expression for \( \beta^3 \) in terms of \( \beta \), we start from the equation we derived for \( \beta^2 \):"
\[
\beta^2 = 2\beta + 1.
\]
"Now, we multiply both sides of this equation by \( \beta \):"
\[
\beta^3 = \beta \cdot \beta^2.
\]
Substituting the expression for \( \beta^2 \) into this equation gives us:
\[
\beta^3 = \beta(2\beta + 1).
\]
Distributing \( \beta \) yields:
\[
\beta^3 = 2\beta^2 + \beta.
\]
Now we can substitute \( \beta^2 \) again using the expression we found earlier:
\[
\beta^3 = 2(2\beta + 1) + \beta.
\]
Simplifying this:
\[
\beta^3 = 4\beta + 2 + \beta = 5\beta + 2.
\]
"Thus, we have:"
\[
\beta^3 = 5\beta + 2.
\]
"Is that correct, Teacher?"
Teacher: Great job! Your derivation for β³ = 5β + 2 is correct.
"Now let's move on to the next step. We need to compute the final expression given by the problem, which is 5α⁴ + 12β³."
We already have:
  α⁴ = 12α + 5  
  β³ = 5β + 2
Replace α⁴ and β³ in the expression:
  5α⁴ + 12β³ = 5(12α + 5) + 12(5β + 2).
"Before you simplify further, can you expand this expression and then combine any like terms? Please work through this step and share your answer."
"Student: To compute \( 5\alpha^4 + 12\beta^3 \), we will substitute the expressions we found for \( \alpha^4 \) and \( \beta^3 \):"
1. We have:
   \[
   \alpha^4 = 12\alpha + 5
   \]
   and
   \[
   \beta^3 = 5\beta + 2.
   \]
2. Now substituting these into the expression:
   \[
   5\alpha^4 + 12\beta^3 = 5(12\alpha + 5) + 12(5\beta + 2).
   \]
3. Expanding each term:
   \[
"   5(12\alpha + 5) = 60\alpha + 25,"
   \]
   and
   \[
   12(5\beta + 2) = 60\beta + 24.
   \]
4. Now we combine these results:
   \[
   5\alpha^4 + 12\beta^3 = (60\alpha + 25) + (60\beta + 24).
   \]
5. Combining like terms gives:
   \[
   5\alpha^4 + 12\beta^3 = 60\alpha + 60\beta + 25 + 24.
   \]
6. Simplifying further:
   \[
   5\alpha^4 + 12\beta^3 = 60(\alpha + \beta) + 49.
   \]
"7. We know from earlier that \( \alpha + \beta = 2 \), so substituting that in:"
   \[
   5\alpha^4 + 12\beta^3 = 60(2) + 49 = 120 + 49 = 169.
   \]
"Therefore, the final result is:"
\[
\boxed{169}.
\]
"Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly expanded and combined the terms to get 60(α + β) + 49, and then, using α + β = 2, you computed 60(2) + 49 = 120 + 49 = 169."
To summarize our process:
1. We first found that α + β = 2 and αβ = –1 from the quadratic equation.
2. Then we expressed higher powers:
"  α³ = 5α + 2, and α⁴ = 12α + 5."
"3. Similarly, we derived β³ = 5β + 2."
"4. Finally, we substituted these into 5α⁴ + 12β³, expanded, and simplified to get 60(α + β) + 49, which with α + β = 2 gave us 169."
"Thus, the final answer is 169$"
