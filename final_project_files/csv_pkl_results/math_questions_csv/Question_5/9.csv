"Question: Given that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the roots of $x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0,$ find $5 \alpha^4 + 12 \beta^3.$"
3o-mini: We are given that α and β are the roots of
  x² - 2x - 1 = 0.
Step 1. Find the roots.
"Using the quadratic formula, we have"
  x = [2 ± √(4 + 4)]/2 = [2 ± √8]/2 = [2 ± 2√2]/2 = 1 ± √2.
"Thus, one root is α = 1 + √2 and the other is β = 1 - √2."
Step 2. Compute α⁴.
"Instead of raising α to the fourth power directly, first compute (1 + √2)²:"
  (1 + √2)² = 1 + 2√2 + 2 = 3 + 2√2.
Now square that result to find α⁴:
  (3 + 2√2)² = 9 + 12√2 + 8 = 17 + 12√2.
"So, α⁴ = 17 + 12√2."
Step 3. Compute β³.
β = 1 - √2. Compute (1 - √2)² first:
  (1 - √2)² = 1 - 2√2 + 2 = 3 - 2√2.
Multiply by (1 - √2) to obtain β³:
  β³ = (1 - √2) * (3 - 2√2) = 3 - 2√2 - 3√2 + 2·2 = 3 - 5√2 + 4 = 7 - 5√2.
Step 4. Put it all together.
We need to find 5α⁴ + 12β³. Substitute the values we found:
  5(17 + 12√2) + 12(7 - 5√2)
  = 85 + 60√2 + 84 - 60√2.
Notice that the √2 terms cancel out:
  85 + 84 = 169.
"Thus, the value of 5α⁴ + 12β³ is 169."
