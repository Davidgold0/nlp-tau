"Question: Given that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the roots of $x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0,$ find $5 \alpha^4 + 12 \beta^3.$"
3o-mini: We are given that α and β are the roots of the quadratic equation
  x² - 2x - 1 = 0.
A useful observation is that both roots satisfy the equation:
  x² = 2x + 1.
We can use this relation to express higher powers of α and β in terms of lower powers.
Step 1. Find α⁴:
"• Since α² = 2α + 1, compute α³:"
  α³ = α · α² = α(2α + 1) = 2α² + α.
Now substitute α² = 2α + 1:
  α³ = 2(2α + 1) + α = 4α + 2 + α = 5α + 2.
"• Next, compute α⁴:"
  α⁴ = α · α³ = α(5α + 2) = 5α² + 2α.
Again substitute α² = 2α + 1:
  α⁴ = 5(2α + 1) + 2α = 10α + 5 + 2α = 12α + 5.
Step 2. Find β³:
"• Similarly, β² = 2β + 1 since β is also a root."
• Compute β³:
  β³ = β · β² = β(2β + 1) = 2β² + β.
Substitute β² = 2β + 1:
  β³ = 2(2β + 1) + β = 4β + 2 + β = 5β + 2.
Step 3. Compute 5α⁴ + 12β³:
• Substitute the expressions from above:
"  5α⁴ = 5(12α + 5) = 60α + 25,"
  12β³ = 12(5β + 2) = 60β + 24.
• Adding these:
  5α⁴ + 12β³ = (60α + 25) + (60β + 24) = 60(α + β) + 49.
Step 4. Find α + β using Vieta’s formulas:
"• For the quadratic x² - 2x - 1 = 0, the sum of the roots is given by:"
  α + β = 2.
Step 5. Finish the calculation:
  5α⁴ + 12β³ = 60(2) + 49 = 120 + 49 = 169.
"Thus, the final answer is 169."
