"Question: A sequence $a_1,$ $a_2,$ $a_3,$ $\dots,$ is defined recursively by $a_1 = 1,$ $a_2 = 1,$ and for $k \ge 3,$_x000D_"
\[a_k = \frac{1}{3} a_{k - 1} + \frac{1}{4} a_{k - 2}.\]Evaluate $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dotsb.$
Teacher: Let's start by outlining our plan for solving the problem.
"1. Let S be the sum we want to find, so S = a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + … with a₁ = 1 and a₂ = 1."
2. Note that the recurrence relation for k ≥ 3 is  
  aₖ = (1/3)·aₖ₋₁ + (1/4)·aₖ₋₂.
3. Express the sum S by separating the first two terms from the rest:  
  S = a₁ + a₂ + (sum of terms from k = 3 to ∞).
4. Substitute the recursive definition into the sum for k ≥ 3 and express that in terms of S.
"5. Set up an equation for S that involves S itself, and then solve for S."
Let’s begin with the first step:
Please set S = a₁ + a₂ + (sum from k = 3 to ∞ of aₖ) and then substitute the recurrence relation into the sum (hinting that you’ll get an expression in terms of S). What equation do you get for S based on this separation?
"Student: To start, we define the sum \( S \) as follows:"
\[
S = a_1 + a_2 + \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k
\]
"Given that \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = 1 \), we can write:"
\[
S = 1 + 1 + \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k = 2 + \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k
\]
"Now, we need to express the sum \( \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k \) using the recurrence relation provided:"
\[
a_k = \frac{1}{3} a_{k-1} + \frac{1}{4} a_{k-2}
\]
Substituting this into the sum gives:
\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k = \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{3} a_{k-1} + \frac{1}{4} a_{k-2} \right)
\]
We can split this sum into two parts:
\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-1} + \frac{1}{4} \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-2}
\]
"Now, we need to adjust the indices of the sums on the right-hand side:"
"1. For the first sum \( \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-1} \), we can change the index by letting \( j = k-1 \), which gives us:"
\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-1} = \sum_{j=2}^{\infty} a_j = S - a_1 = S - 1
\]
"2. For the second sum \( \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-2} \), we change the index by letting \( m = k-2 \), which results in:"
\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-2} = \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} a_m = S
\]
"Putting it all together, we have:"
\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k = \frac{1}{3} (S - 1) + \frac{1}{4} S
\]
"Now, substituting this back into our expression for \( S \):"
\[
S = 2 + \frac{1}{3} (S - 1) + \frac{1}{4} S
\]
"Next, we simplify this equation:"
\[
S = 2 + \frac{1}{3} S - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} S
\]
Combining the constant terms gives:
\[
S = \frac{5}{3} + \left( \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} \right) S
\]
"Now, we need to find a common denominator for the coefficients of \( S \):"
\[
\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{7}{12}
\]
"So, we rewrite the equation as:"
\[
S = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{7}{12} S
\]
"Next, we isolate \( S \):"
\[
S - \frac{7}{12} S = \frac{5}{3}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{5}{12} S = \frac{5}{3}
\]
"Now, multiplying both sides by \( \frac{12}{5} \):"
\[
S = \frac{5}{3} \cdot \frac{12}{5} = 4
\]
"Thus, the sum \( S = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dotsb \) evaluates to:"
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
Teacher: Excellent work! You carefully broke down the sum and correctly changed the indices to express the infinite series in terms of S. Your rearrangement and the subsequent algebraic steps to isolate S are spot on.
"Before we conclude, could you quickly explain in your own words why the substitution j = k – 1 in the sum ∑ₖ₌₃∞ aₖ and the resulting expression S – a₁ is valid? This will ensure you've fully understood that step."
Student: Sure! The substitution \( j = k - 1 \) in the sum \( \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-1} \) is valid because it effectively shifts the index of summation by one. 
Here’s how it works:
"1. When \( k \) starts at 3, substituting \( j = k - 1 \) means that when \( k = 3 \), \( j = 2 \). "
"2. As \( k \) increases to infinity, \( j \) will also increase to infinity. So, the limits of the sum change from \( k = 3 \) to \( \infty \) to \( j = 2 \) to \( \infty \)."
"3. Thus, we can rewrite the sum \( \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-1} \) as \( \sum_{j=2}^{\infty} a_j \)."
"Now, since we defined \( S \) as the sum of all terms in the sequence, \( S = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + \ldots \), we can see that:"
\[
\sum_{j=2}^{\infty} a_j = S - a_1
\]
"This is because the sum from \( j = 2 \) onward includes all terms of the sequence starting from \( a_2 \) and excludes \( a_1 \). Therefore, we can express it as \( S - a_1 \), which in this case is \( S - 1 \)."
"This substitution helps us relate the sums back to \( S \), allowing us to set up the equation we needed to solve for \( S \). "
I hope this clarifies why that step is valid!
"Teacher: You've provided a very clear and accurate explanation for why the substitution j = k – 1 works. You showed that when k starts at 3, j starts at 2, and thus the sum ∑ₖ₌₃∞ aₖ₋₁ becomes ∑ⱼ₌₂∞ aⱼ—which is just the whole sum S minus the first term, a₁. "
Well done! Your understanding of re-indexing and isolating the desired terms in the series is spot on.
"Since you've now justified the re-indexing and successfully derived the equation for S, can you summarize the overall strategy you followed to solve for S? Please explain how you rearranged and solved the equation without directly providing the final numeric answer yet."
Student: Certainly! Here’s a summary of the overall strategy I followed to solve for \( S \):
1. **Define the Sum \( S \)**: I began by defining \( S \) as the total sum of the sequence: 
   \[
   S = a_1 + a_2 + \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k.
   \]
"   Given that \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = 1 \), I expressed \( S \) as:"
   \[
   S = 2 + \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k.
   \]
"2. **Use the Recurrence Relation**: I then substituted the recurrence relation \( a_k = \frac{1}{3} a_{k-1} + \frac{1}{4} a_{k-2} \) into the sum from \( k = 3 \) to infinity, splitting it into two separate sums:"
   \[
   \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-1} + \frac{1}{4} \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-2}.
   \]
3. **Re-index the Sums**: I changed the indices of the sums on the right-hand side:
"   - For \( \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-1} \), I used \( j = k - 1 \) to rewrite it as \( S - 1 \)."
"   - For \( \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-2} \), I used \( m = k - 2 \) to rewrite it as \( S \)."
"4. **Combine and Rearrange**: After substituting back into the equation for \( S \), I had:"
   \[
   S = 2 + \frac{1}{3}(S - 1) + \frac{1}{4}S.
   \]
   I then combined the terms and simplified it to isolate \( S \).
5. **Solve for \( S \)**: I rearranged the equation to gather all terms involving \( S \) on one side:
   \[
   S - \left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}\right) S = \frac{5}{3}.
   \]
"   I found a common denominator for the coefficients of \( S \), simplified it, and then solved for \( S \)."
"This structured approach allowed me to systematically relate the sums to \( S \) and isolate it effectively. Each step built upon the previous one, leading me to the final expression for \( S \). "
I hope this summarizes my strategy clearly!
"Teacher: That's an excellent summary! You've clearly explained how you set up S, applied the recurrence relation, re-indexed the sums, and rearranged the equation to isolate S. Your strategy is well laid out and shows that you understand each component of the process without jumping to the final numeric answer just yet."
"Now, can you identify any potential pitfalls that might occur during the re-indexing or algebraic manipulation stages? What should one be particularly careful about in these steps?"
"Student: Certainly! Here are some potential pitfalls to be aware of during the re-indexing and algebraic manipulation stages, along with what to be particularly careful about:"
"1. **Incorrect Index Shifts**: When re-indexing sums, it's crucial to ensure that the new index correctly reflects the original limits of the sum. For instance, if you shift the index from \( k \) to \( j = k - 1 \), you must adjust the starting point accordingly. Failing to do this can lead to incorrect limits and ultimately an incorrect sum."
"2. **Maintaining Consistency in Terms**: While manipulating equations, it’s important to keep track of which terms are being combined or isolated. For example, when you express \( S \) in terms of itself and other constants, ensure that you do not lose any terms or inadvertently combine different sums incorrectly."
"3. **Common Denominators**: When adding fractions (like the coefficients of \( S \)), it's essential to correctly find a common denominator. Mistakes here can lead to incorrect coefficients in your final equation. Always double-check the arithmetic when combining fractions."
"4. **Sign Errors**: While rearranging equations, be mindful of the signs. When moving terms from one side of the equation to the other, the sign changes. A small sign error can drastically alter the outcome of the solution."
"5. **Final Substitutions**: After isolating \( S \) and solving for it, ensure that the final expression is checked against the original definitions and constraints of the problem. This helps verify that the calculated value is indeed reasonable and consistent with the recursive definitions."
"6. **Understanding the Recurrence Relation**: When substituting the recurrence relation into the sums, it's vital to ensure that you are applying the relation correctly. Misinterpreting the relation could lead to incorrect expressions for the sums."
"By being cautious about these potential pitfalls, one can avoid common mistakes that arise during the re-indexing and algebraic manipulation stages. Careful attention to detail at each step is key to successfully solving the problem!"
"Teacher: You've done an excellent job identifying the potential pitfalls. You've accurately noted that it's important to carefully adjust the indices when re-indexing, ensure that all constants and S-terms are correctly combined, pay attention to common denominators and signs, and verify each step against the original recurrence relation. All of these checks are crucial to avoid errors and to maintain clarity and correctness in the algebraic manipulations."
To summarize our entire approach:
1. We defined S as the sum of the sequence.
2. We expressed the infinite tail (from a₃ onward) using the recurrence relation.
"3. By re-indexing the sums, we wrote the tail sum in terms of S (specifically, S – a₁ and S)."
"4. This allowed us to rewrite the sum S as an equation involving S, which we then solved by collecting like terms and isolating S."
"5. Finally, we checked our work by identifying potential pitfalls, ensuring we correctly shifted indices and managed all algebraic steps."
"Now, based on your work and the approach we've discussed, what is the final numerical value of S? Please provide your final numeric answer exactly as stated, followed immediately by a $."
