"Question: A sequence $a_1,$ $a_2,$ $a_3,$ $\dots,$ is defined recursively by $a_1 = 1,$ $a_2 = 1,$ and for $k \ge 3,$_x000D_"
\[a_k = \frac{1}{3} a_{k - 1} + \frac{1}{4} a_{k - 2}.\]Evaluate $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dotsb.$
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem. We have a recursively defined sequence where
"  a₁ = 1, a₂ = 1, and for k ≥ 3, aₖ = (1/3)aₖ₋₁ + (1/4)aₖ₋₂."
We need to find the sum
  S = a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + · · ·
"A good first step is to write S while separating the first few terms and then express the remaining terms using the recurrence. For instance, write S as:"
  S = a₁ + a₂ + (sum from k=3 to ∞ of aₖ).
"Then, substitute the recursive formula into the sum for k ≥ 3."
Can you try setting up this equation using S? What expression would you get when you substitute the recurrence for aₖ?
Student: Sure! Let's start by writing the sum \( S \) as you suggested:
\[
S = a_1 + a_2 + \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k.
\]
"We know that \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = 1 \), so we can simplify this to:"
\[
S = 1 + 1 + \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k = 2 + \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k.
\]
"Now, for \( k \geq 3 \), we use the recursive definition of \( a_k \):"
\[
a_k = \frac{1}{3} a_{k-1} + \frac{1}{4} a_{k-2}.
\]
Substituting this into the sum gives us:
\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k = \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{3} a_{k-1} + \frac{1}{4} a_{k-2} \right).
\]
We can separate this into two sums:
\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-1} + \frac{1}{4} \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-2}.
\]
"Now, notice that:"
"- The sum \( \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-1} \) can be rewritten by changing the index of summation. If we let \( j = k - 1 \), then \( k = j + 1 \) and when \( k = 3 \), \( j = 2 \). Thus:"
\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-1} = \sum_{j=2}^{\infty} a_j = S - a_1 = S - 1.
\]
"- Similarly, for \( \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-2} \), if we let \( m = k - 2 \), then \( k = m + 2 \) and when \( k = 3 \), \( m = 1 \):"
\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-2} = \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} a_m = S.
\]
Putting these back into our equation gives:
\[
\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k = \frac{1}{3} (S - 1) + \frac{1}{4} S.
\]
"Now, substituting this back into our expression for \( S \):"
\[
S = 2 + \frac{1}{3}(S - 1) + \frac{1}{4}S.
\]
"Next, we can simplify this:"
\[
S = 2 + \frac{1}{3}S - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}S.
\]
Combining the constants gives:
\[
S = \frac{5}{3} + \left( \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} \right) S.
\]
"To combine the coefficients of \( S \), we find a common denominator for \( \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \frac{1}{4} \), which is 12:"
\[
"\frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{7}{12}."
\]
"Thus, we have:"
\[
S = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{7}{12} S.
\]
Now we can isolate \( S \):
\[
"S - \frac{7}{12} S = \frac{5}{3},"
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
\frac{5}{12} S = \frac{5}{3}.
\]
"Now, multiplying both sides by \( \frac{12}{5} \):"
\[
S = \frac{5}{3} \cdot \frac{12}{5} = 4.
\]
"So, the final result is:"
\[
\boxed{4}.
\]
"Teacher: You've done a great job setting up the series and substituting the recurrence into the sum for k ≥ 3. Now, let's focus on the next step. We reached the equation"
  S = 2 + (1/3)(S – 1) + (1/4)S.
"The next step is to simplify this equation and isolate S. Can you show how you would combine the terms, group the S terms on one side, and solve the resulting equation for S? Please work through that step-by-step."
Student: Sure! Let's take the equation we derived:
\[
S = 2 + \frac{1}{3}(S - 1) + \frac{1}{4}S.
\]
"First, let's distribute the \(\frac{1}{3}\):"
\[
S = 2 + \frac{1}{3}S - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}S.
\]
"Now, we can combine the constant terms on the right side:"
\[
S = 2 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3}S + \frac{1}{4}S.
\]
"To combine \(2 - \frac{1}{3}\), we can express \(2\) as \(\frac{6}{3}\):"
\[
2 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{6}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{3}.
\]
So now we have:
\[
S = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{1}{3}S + \frac{1}{4}S.
\]
"Next, let's combine the terms involving \(S\). We need to find a common denominator for \(\frac{1}{3}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\). The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12. Thus:"
\[
"\frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}, \quad \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}."
\]
Adding these together gives:
\[
\frac{1}{3}S + \frac{1}{4}S = \left(\frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12}\right)S = \frac{7}{12}S.
\]
Now we can rewrite our equation as:
\[
S = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{7}{12}S.
\]
"Next, we want to isolate \(S\). We can subtract \(\frac{7}{12}S\) from both sides:"
\[
S - \frac{7}{12}S = \frac{5}{3}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\left(1 - \frac{7}{12}\right)S = \frac{5}{3}.
\]
Calculating \(1 - \frac{7}{12}\):
\[
1 = \frac{12}{12} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 - \frac{7}{12} = \frac{12}{12} - \frac{7}{12} = \frac{5}{12}.
\]
So we have:
\[
\frac{5}{12}S = \frac{5}{3}.
\]
"Now, to solve for \(S\), we multiply both sides by \(\frac{12}{5}\):"
\[
S = \frac{5}{3} \cdot \frac{12}{5} = 4.
\]
"Thus, the final result is:"
\[
\boxed{4}.
\]
"Teacher: Great work! You've correctly distributed, combined like terms, and isolated S to arrive at the equation (5/12)S = 5/3, and then solved for S. Your manipulation of the fractions was spot on. "
"Since you've reached your solution, can you now clearly state your final answer as the sum S? Please provide your final answer."
"Student: Certainly! After working through the steps and solving the equation, we found that the sum \( S \) of the sequence is:"
\[
S = 4.
\]
"Thus, the final answer is:"
\[
\boxed{4}.
\]
"Teacher: You've worked through the problem step by step very well. To summarize briefly, we set up the series as S = 2 + (1/3)(S – 1) + (1/4)S, then grouped like terms and isolated S. This led us to the equation (5/12)S = 5/3, which we solved to find S = 4."
