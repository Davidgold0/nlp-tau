"Question: A sequence $a_1,$ $a_2,$ $a_3,$ $\dots,$ is defined recursively by $a_1 = 1,$ $a_2 = 1,$ and for $k \ge 3,$_x000D_"
\[a_k = \frac{1}{3} a_{k - 1} + \frac{1}{4} a_{k - 2}.\]Evaluate $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dotsb.$
Teacher: Let's begin by breaking down the problem. We need to find the sum
  S = a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + ⋯
"given that a₁ = 1, a₂ = 1, and for k ≥ 3, the sequence satisfies"
  aₖ = (1/3)aₖ₋₁ + (1/4)aₖ₋₂.
One common strategy is to write S in terms of itself by isolating the sum from the k = 3 term onward and then using the recurrence relation.
Here’s a sequence of steps to consider:
1. Write S as the sum of the first two terms plus the remainder:
  S = a₁ + a₂ + (a₃ + a₄ + a₅ + ⋯).
2. Express the tail (the sum from k = 3 to infinity) using the recurrence definition of aₖ. This will likely involve shifting the index in the sums so that the tail can be written in terms of S.
"3. Set up an equation that involves S on both sides. Then, solve the equation to determine S."
Let's start with step 1.
Can you express S as the sum of the first two terms plus the sum from k = 3 to infinity? Please provide that expression.
"Student: Sure! Following your guidance, I can express \( S \) as follows:"
\[
S = a_1 + a_2 + (a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + \cdots).
\]
"Since we know that \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = 1 \), we can substitute those values into the expression:"
\[
S = 1 + 1 + (a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + \cdots).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
S = 2 + (a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + \cdots).
\]
"Now, we can denote the tail sum \( T = a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + \cdots \), so we have:"
\[
S = 2 + T.
\]
"Next, we need to express \( T \) in terms of \( S \) using the recurrence relation. Would you like me to proceed with that?"
"Teacher: Good work! You've correctly written S as 2 plus the tail sum, T, where"
  S = 2 + T  and  T = a₃ + a₄ + a₅ + ⋯
"Now for step 2, let's use the recurrence relation for aₖ (for k ≥ 3), which is"
  aₖ = (1/3)aₖ₋₁ + (1/4)aₖ₋₂.
"Can you express the tail sum T using this recurrence? In other words, write T as a sum involving the terms of the sequence in a way that uses the recurrence definition, and then consider shifting the indices so it is in terms of S. Please show me your work on this step."
"Student: Sure! To express the tail sum \( T = a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + \cdots \) using the recurrence relation, we can write each term in the sum using the relation \( a_k = \frac{1}{3} a_{k-1} + \frac{1}{4} a_{k-2} \)."
Let's break it down:
1. For \( a_3 \):
   \[
   a_3 = \frac{1}{3} a_2 + \frac{1}{4} a_1 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{7}{12}.
   \]
2. For \( a_4 \):
   \[
   a_4 = \frac{1}{3} a_3 + \frac{1}{4} a_2 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{7}{12} + \frac{1}{4} \cdot 1 = \frac{7}{36} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{7}{36} + \frac{9}{36} = \frac{16}{36} = \frac{4}{9}.
   \]
3. For \( a_5 \):
   \[
   a_5 = \frac{1}{3} a_4 + \frac{1}{4} a_3 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{9} + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{7}{12} = \frac{4}{27} + \frac{7}{48}.
   \]
"Now, let's express \( T \) in terms of the recurrence relation:"
\[
T = a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + \cdots = \left( \frac{1}{3} a_2 + \frac{1}{4} a_1 \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3} a_3 + \frac{1}{4} a_2 \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3} a_4 + \frac{1}{4} a_3 \right) + \cdots.
\]
We can write this as:
\[
T = \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_k = \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{3} a_{k-1} + \frac{1}{4} a_{k-2} \right).
\]
"Now, we can shift the indices in the sums:"
- The first sum becomes \( \frac{1}{3} \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-1} = \frac{1}{3} T \) since \( a_{k-1} \) starts from \( a_2 \).
- The second sum becomes \( \frac{1}{4} \sum_{k=3}^{\infty} a_{k-2} = \frac{1}{4} T \) since \( a_{k-2} \) starts from \( a_1 \).
"Thus, we can express \( T \) as:"
\[
T = \frac{1}{3} T + \frac{1}{4} S.
\]
"Now, we have an equation involving \( T \) and \( S \). Would you like me to solve this equation for \( T \)?"
"Teacher: You've made a good start by writing the tail sum in terms of the recurrence. However, there's a little mix-up with the index shifts. Let's review that carefully."
We have:
  T = a₃ + a₄ + a₅ + …  
"and for k ≥ 3,  "
  aₖ = (1/3)aₖ₋₁ + (1/4)aₖ₋₂.
"So, writing T as a sum, we get:"
  T = ∑ₖ₌₃∞ aₖ = ∑ₖ₌₃∞ [(1/3)aₖ₋₁ + (1/4)aₖ₋₂].
"Now, you'll split this sum into two parts:"
  T = (1/3)∑ₖ₌₃∞ aₖ₋₁ + (1/4)∑ₖ₌₃∞ aₖ₋₂.
"For the first sum, let j = k − 1. Then when k = 3, j = 2; when k = 4, j = 3; and so on. That sum becomes:"
  ∑₍ₖ₌₃∞₎ aₖ₋₁ = ∑₍ⱼ₌₂∞₎ aⱼ = (a₂ + a₃ + a₄ + …) = S − a₁ = S − 1.
"For the second sum, let m = k − 2. Then when k = 3, m = 1; when k = 4, m = 2; and so on. That sum becomes:"
  ∑₍ₖ₌₃∞₎ aₖ₋₂ = ∑₍ₘ₌₁∞₎ aₘ = S.
"So substituting these into our expression for T, we get:"
  T = (1/3)(S − 1) + (1/4)S.
Can you now simplify this equation for T using your values for S and see how this relates to T and S? Please show your work.
Student: Sure! Let's simplify the equation for \( T \) using the substitutions you've outlined.
We have:
\[
T = \frac{1}{3}(S - 1) + \frac{1}{4}S.
\]
"Now, let's distribute the terms on the right side:"
\[
T = \frac{1}{3}S - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}S.
\]
"Next, we need to combine the terms involving \( S \). To do that, we can find a common denominator for the coefficients of \( S \). The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12, so we convert the fractions:"
\[
\frac{1}{3}S = \frac{4}{12}S \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{4}S = \frac{3}{12}S.
\]
"Now, we can combine these:"
\[
T = \left(\frac{4}{12}S + \frac{3}{12}S\right) - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7}{12}S - \frac{1}{3}.
\]
"Next, we can convert \( \frac{1}{3} \) into twelfths as well:"
\[
\frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}.
\]
So now we have:
\[
T = \frac{7}{12}S - \frac{4}{12} = \frac{7}{12}S - \frac{4}{12}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
T = \frac{7}{12}S - \frac{4}{12}.
\]
Now we can substitute this expression for \( T \) back into our earlier equation for \( S \):
\[
S = 2 + T.
\]
Substituting \( T \):
\[
S = 2 + \left(\frac{7}{12}S - \frac{4}{12}\right).
\]
"Now, let's simplify this equation:"
\[
S = 2 + \frac{7}{12}S - \frac{4}{12}.
\]
We can express 2 as \( \frac{24}{12} \):
\[
S = \frac{24}{12} - \frac{4}{12} + \frac{7}{12}S.
\]
Combining the constants gives:
\[
S = \frac{20}{12} + \frac{7}{12}S.
\]
"Now, we can isolate \( S \) by moving the \( \frac{7}{12}S \) term to the left side:"
\[
S - \frac{7}{12}S = \frac{20}{12}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{5}{12}S = \frac{20}{12}.
\]
"Now, multiplying both sides by \( \frac{12}{5} \) to solve for \( S \):"
\[
S = \frac{20}{12} \cdot \frac{12}{5} = \frac{20}{5} = 4.
\]
"Thus, the sum \( S = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots \) evaluates to:"
\[
\boxed{4}.
\]
Teacher: You've done a great job so far! Let's review your work step by step.
1. You correctly wrote the sum S as
  S = a₁ + a₂ + (a₃ + a₄ + a₅ + …)
"which, with a₁ = 1 and a₂ = 1, becomes"
"  S = 2 + T,"
with T = a₃ + a₄ + a₅ + ….
"2. For the tail sum T, you set up"
  T = Σₖ₌₃∞ aₖ = Σₖ₌₃∞ [(1/3)aₖ₋₁ + (1/4)aₖ₋₂].
"Then, by shifting indices:"
"  ∑ₖ₌₃∞ aₖ₋₁ becomes ∑ⱼ₌₂∞ aⱼ = S – a₁ = S – 1,"
and
  ∑ₖ₌₃∞ aₖ₋₂ becomes ∑ₘ₌₁∞ aₘ = S.
"Thus, you obtained"
  T = (1/3)(S – 1) + (1/4)S.
3. You then simplified this expression to:
  T = (1/3)S – (1/3) + (1/4)S = (7/12)S – (1/3).
"Using that in S = 2 + T, you set up:"
"  S = 2 + (7/12)S – (1/3),"
"which, after expressing 2 as 24/12 and 1/3 as 4/12, gave:"
  S = (24/12 – 4/12) + (7/12)S = (20/12) + (7/12)S.
Subtracting (7/12)S from both sides led you to:
"  (5/12)S = 20/12,"
so that
  S = (20/12) · (12/5) = 4.
"Your solution is correct. If you’re satisfied with your reasoning, please state your final answer."
"Student: Yes, I am satisfied with my reasoning and the steps we've taken to arrive at the solution. The sum \( S = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots \) evaluates to:"
\[
\boxed{4}.
\]
Teacher: Great job! Your final answer is 4$.
