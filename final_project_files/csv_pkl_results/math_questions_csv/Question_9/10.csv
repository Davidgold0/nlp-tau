"Question: A sequence $a_1,$ $a_2,$ $a_3,$ $\dots,$ is defined recursively by $a_1 = 1,$ $a_2 = 1,$ and for $k \ge 3,$_x000D_"
\[a_k = \frac{1}{3} a_{k - 1} + \frac{1}{4} a_{k - 2}.\]Evaluate $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dotsb.$
3o-mini: We are given the recursive sequence
"  a₁ = 1, a₂ = 1, and for k ≥ 3, aₖ = (1/3)aₖ₋₁ + (1/4)aₖ₋₂."
We wish to evaluate the infinite sum
  S = a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + a₄ + ⋯.
Step 1. Write the sum starting from k = 3:
  S = a₁ + a₂ + (a₃ + a₄ + a₅ + ⋯).
"So, S = 1 + 1 + Σₖ₌₃∞ aₖ = 2 + Σₖ₌₃∞ aₖ."
Step 2. Express Σₖ₌₃∞ aₖ using the recurrence.
"Notice that for k ≥ 3, aₖ = (1/3)aₖ₋₁ + (1/4)aₖ₋₂. Thus,"
  Σₖ₌₃∞ aₖ = (1/3) Σₖ₌₃∞ aₖ₋₁ + (1/4) Σₖ₌₃∞ aₖ₋₂.
Change the index of summation for each part:
"- For the first sum, let j = k − 1. Then as k goes from 3 to ∞, j goes from 2 to ∞, so:"
  Σₖ₌₃∞ aₖ₋₁ = Σⱼ₌₂∞ aⱼ = S − a₁ = S − 1.
"- For the second sum, let m = k − 2. Then as k goes from 3 to ∞, m goes from 1 to ∞, so:"
  Σₖ₌₃∞ aₖ₋₂ = Σₘ₌₁∞ aₘ = S.
"Thus, we obtain:"
  Σₖ₌₃∞ aₖ = (1/3)(S − 1) + (1/4)S.
Step 3. Substitute this back into the expression for S:
  S = 2 + (1/3)(S − 1) + (1/4)S.
Step 4. Solve for S:
  S = 2 + (1/3)S − 1/3 + (1/4)S  
    S = (2 − 1/3) + [(1/3) + (1/4)]S  
    S = (6/3 − 1/3) + [(4/12) + (3/12)]S  
    S = (5/3) + (7/12)S.
Subtract (7/12)S from both sides:
  S − (7/12)S = 5/3  
  (5/12)S = 5/3.
"Now, multiply both sides by 12/5:"
  S = (5/3) × (12/5) = 12/3 = 4.
"Thus, the sum of the infinite sequence is 4."
Answer: 4.
