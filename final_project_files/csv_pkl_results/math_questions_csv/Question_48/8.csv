Question: What is the value of $82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3$?  (No calculators!  And see if you can do it in your head!)
"3o-mini: Notice that the expression has the form of a binomial expansion. In general, (a + b)³ expands to:"
  a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³
"Comparing with the given problem, we have a = 82 and b = 18. Therefore, the expression becomes:"
  (82 + 18)³
"Since 82 + 18 = 100, we have:"
"  100³ = 100 × 100 × 100 = 1,000,000"
"Thus, the value is 1,000,000."
