Question: What is the value of $82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3$?  (No calculators!  And see if you can do it in your head!)
"3o-mini: Notice that the expression follows the binomial expansion for (a + b)³. In general, (a + b)³ expands to:"
 a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³.
"Here, a = 82 and b = 18. So the expression is simply (82 + 18)³ = 100³, which equals 1,000,000."
