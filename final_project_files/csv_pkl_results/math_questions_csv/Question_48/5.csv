Question: What is the value of $82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3$?  (No calculators!  And see if you can do it in your head!)
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem into smaller steps. The expression 
  82³ + 3(82²)(18) + 3(82)(18²) + 18³
looks like it might be an expansion of a binomial expression raised to a power. 
"Step 1: Can you identify which binomial expansion formula this expression fits, and what the values of a and b are in that formula? Please explain your reasoning."
Student: The expression \( 82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3 \) resembles the binomial expansion of \( (a + b)^3 \). 
"In the binomial expansion formula, \( (a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3 \), we can see that:"
- The term \( a^3 \) corresponds to \( 82^3 \).
- The term \( b^3 \) corresponds to \( 18^3 \).
- The terms \( 3a^2b \) and \( 3ab^2 \) correspond to \( 3(82^2)(18) \) and \( 3(82)(18^2) \) respectively.
"From this, we can identify:"
- \( a = 82 \)
- \( b = 18 \)
"So, the expression is indeed the expansion of \( (82 + 18)^3 \). "
Does that reasoning make sense?
"Teacher: Great work in identifying the pattern and matching it with the (a + b)³ expansion, where a = 82 and b = 18!"
"Now for Step 2: Since we have recognized the expansion, we see that"
  82³ + 3(82²)(18) + 3(82)(18²) + 18³ = (82 + 18)³
Can you calculate what 82 + 18 equals? Please show your work and reasoning for that step.
Student: To calculate \( 82 + 18 \):
1. Start with the number 82.
2. Add 18 to it.
Breaking it down:
- \( 82 + 18 \) can be thought of as \( 82 + 10 + 8 \).
"- First, add 10 to 82: "
  \[
  82 + 10 = 92
  \]
"- Then, add 8 to 92:"
  \[
  92 + 8 = 100
  \]
"So, \( 82 + 18 = 100 \)."
"Now that we have \( 82 + 18 = 100 \), we can substitute this back into our expression:"
\[
(82 + 18)^3 = 100^3
\]
Does this make sense? Would you like me to continue with calculating \( 100^3 \)?
"Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly found that 82 + 18 equals 100, and so the expression becomes (82 + 18)³ = 100³."
"Step 3: Now, can you calculate what 100³ is? Please show how you work through that multiplication, and let me know your answer for 100³."
"Student: To calculate \( 100^3 \), we can use the property of exponents that states \( (a \cdot b)^n = a^n \cdot b^n \). In this case, we can express \( 100 \) as \( 10^2 \):"
\[
100^3 = (10^2)^3
\]
"Using the exponent multiplication rule, we have:"
\[
(10^2)^3 = 10^{2 \cdot 3} = 10^6
\]
"Now, \( 10^6 \) means 1 followed by 6 zeros, which gives us:"
\[
"10^6 = 1,000,000"
\]
"Therefore, \( 100^3 = 1,000,000 \)."
"So, the value of \( 82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3 \) is \( 1,000,000 \). "
Does that answer your question?
"Teacher: Great job working through the steps! Your reasoning was correct, and you've successfully calculated that the original expression simplifies to (82 + 18)³, which is 100³. "
"Now, please double-check your multiplication and exponent work for 100³ to ensure everything is correct before we confirm the final answer. Could you carefully explain how you arrived at 100³ = 1,000,000?"
Student: Sure! Let's double-check the calculation of \( 100^3 \) step-by-step to ensure everything is accurate.
1. **Understanding \( 100^3 \)**:
   We know that \( 100^3 \) means \( 100 \times 100 \times 100 \).
2. **Breaking it down**:
   We can first calculate \( 100 \times 100 \):
   \[
"   100 \times 100 = 10,000"
   \]
3. **Now multiply by 100 again**:
"   Next, we take that result and multiply it by 100:"
   \[
"   10,000 \times 100 = 1,000,000"
   \]
4. **Using the exponent rule**:
"   Alternatively, we can also express \( 100 \) as \( 10^2 \) and use the exponent rule:"
   \[
   100^3 = (10^2)^3 = 10^{2 \times 3} = 10^6
   \]
"   And \( 10^6 \) is indeed \( 1,000,000 \)."
"Both methods confirm that \( 100^3 = 1,000,000 \)."
"So, the value of \( 82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3 \) is indeed \( 1,000,000 \). "
Thank you for guiding me through the verification process! Does this look good for the final answer?
Teacher: You've done a wonderful job working through the problem! To summarize our steps:
1. We recognized that the given expression is the expansion of (a + b)³ with a = 82 and b = 18.
2. We computed 82 + 18 to obtain 100.
"3. We then computed 100³, confirming that 100 multiplied by itself three times equals 1,000,000."
Final answer:
1000000$
