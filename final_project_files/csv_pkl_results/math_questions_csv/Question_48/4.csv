Question: What is the value of $82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3$?  (No calculators!  And see if you can do it in your head!)
Teacher: Let's work together on this! Look at the expression: 
  82³ + 3(82²)(18) + 3(82)(18²) + 18³
It resembles the pattern from the Binomial Theorem. One of the key formulas you might recall is the expansion of (a + b)³. 
"Step 1: Can you identify how this expression relates to (a + b)³? In other words, if we set up (a + b)³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³, what values of a and b would match our expression? Please share your thoughts for this step."
Student: Sure! The expression \( 82^3 + 3(82^2)(18) + 3(82)(18^2) + 18^3 \) does resemble the expansion of \( (a + b)^3 \). 
"In the formula \( (a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3 \), I can see that:"
"- The term \( a^3 \) corresponds to \( 82^3 \), so I can set \( a = 82 \)."
"- The term \( b^3 \) corresponds to \( 18^3 \), so I can set \( b = 18 \)."
This means we can identify \( a = 82 \) and \( b = 18 \). 
"So, the expression can be rewritten as \( (82 + 18)^3 \). "
What should we do next?
Teacher: Great job identifying a = 82 and b = 18 and rewriting the expression as (82 + 18)³!
"Step 2: Now, please find the sum of 82 and 18. What do you get when you add these numbers?"
"Student: Student: When I add \( 82 \) and \( 18 \), I get:"
\[
82 + 18 = 100.
\]
"So, we have \( (82 + 18)^3 = 100^3 \). "
What should we do next?
Teacher: Excellent work! You correctly computed 82 + 18 = 100. 
Step 3: Now let's find the value of 100³. Please calculate 100³. What result do you get?
"Student: Student: To find \( 100^3 \), I can use the fact that \( 100 = 10^2 \). Therefore:"
\[
100^3 = (10^2)^3 = 10^{2 \times 3} = 10^6.
\]
Calculating \( 10^6 \) gives me:
\[
"10^6 = 1,000,000."
\]
"So, the value of \( 100^3 \) is \( 1,000,000 \). "
Is that correct?
"Teacher: Great job! Your computation is perfectly correct. You showed that the expression 82³ + 3(82²)(18) + 3(82)(18²) + 18³ can be expressed as (82 + 18)³, which you then simplified by adding to get 100. Then you found 100³ = 1,000,000."
"So, the final answer is 1,000,000$"
