Question: Mary and James each sit in a row of 7 chairs.  They choose their seats at random.  What is the probability that they don't sit next to each other?
"3o-mini: There are 7 chairs in total. Mary can choose any of the 7 chairs, and then James has 6 remaining choices, giving 7 × 6 = 42 total possible seating arrangements."
"Now, count the arrangements where Mary and James sit next to each other. In a row of 7 chairs, there are 6 pairs of adjacent seats (chairs 1-2, 2-3, …, 6-7). For each pair, there are 2 ways to seat Mary and James (Mary in the first seat and James in the second or vice versa), so there are 6 × 2 = 12 arrangements where they sit next to each other."
"Thus, the number of arrangements in which they do NOT sit next to each other is 42 − 12 = 30."
The probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total outcomes:
  Probability = 30/42 = 5/7.
"So, the probability is 5/7."
