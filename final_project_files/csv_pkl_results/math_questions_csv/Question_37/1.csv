Question: Mary and James each sit in a row of 7 chairs.  They choose their seats at random.  What is the probability that they don't sit next to each other?
Teacher: Let's begin by outlining the steps needed to solve this problem:
1. Restate the problem in your own words.
2. Determine the total number of ways Mary and James can choose their seats in the row of 7 chairs.
3. Compute the number of arrangements in which Mary and James sit next to each other.
"4. Subtract the number of ""adjacent seating"" arrangements from the total to find the number of ways they do not sit next to each other."
5. Divide the favorable (non-adjacent) arrangements by the total arrangements to obtain the desired probability.
6. Simplify the result.
"Let's start with the first step: Determine the total number of ways Mary and James can choose their seats in the row. How many ways do you think they can be seated, and why?"
"Student: To restate the problem in my own words: Mary and James are choosing seats from a row of 7 chairs, and we need to find the probability that they do not sit next to each other."
"Now, for the first step, the total number of ways Mary and James can choose their seats in the row of 7 chairs is determined by how many different pairs of seats they can occupy. "
"Since there are 7 chairs, Mary can choose any one of the 7 chairs. After Mary has chosen her seat, James can choose any of the remaining 6 chairs. Therefore, the total number of ways they can be seated is:"
\[ 
7 \text{ (choices for Mary)} \times 6 \text{ (choices for James)} = 42 \text{ total arrangements} 
\]
Is this correct?
Teacher: Great job on finding the total number of seating arrangements correctly! You’ve identified that there are 42 ways for Mary and James to choose their seats.
"Now, let’s tackle the next step: Counting the number of arrangements in which Mary and James sit next to each other. "
"Think about it this way: in a row of 7 chairs, how many pairs of adjacent seats are there? Once you find that, consider that Mary and James can sit in either order within each pair. "
Please work on this next step and let me know your reasoning and calculations.
"Student: Student: Thank you! Now, to find the number of arrangements where Mary and James sit next to each other, I will first identify the pairs of adjacent seats in the row of 7 chairs."
"If we label the chairs as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, the pairs of adjacent seats are:"
"- (1, 2)"
"- (2, 3)"
"- (3, 4)"
"- (4, 5)"
"- (5, 6)"
"- (6, 7)"
This gives us a total of 6 pairs of adjacent seats.
"Next, for each of these pairs, Mary and James can sit in either order. So, for each pair, there are 2 arrangements (Mary in the first seat and James in the second, or vice versa). "
"Thus, the total number of arrangements where Mary and James sit next to each other is:"
\[ 
6 \text{ (pairs)} \times 2 \text{ (arrangements per pair)} = 12 \text{ arrangements} 
\]
Is this calculation correct?
"Teacher: Great work! Your calculation for the adjacent seating arrangements is spot on. There are indeed 6 adjacent pairs, and with 2 orders for Mary and James in each pair, that gives 12 arrangements where they sit next to each other."
"Now, let's move to the next step: determining the number of seating arrangements where Mary and James do NOT sit next to each other and then computing the probability."
To do this:
1. Subtract the 12 adjacent arrangements from the total of 42 arrangements.
2. Express the probability as the number of non-adjacent arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements.
3. Simplify the fraction if possible.
Please work through these calculations and show me your reasoning for how you obtained the number of non-adjacent seating arrangements and the probability.
"Student: Student: Thank you for the guidance! Now, I will follow the steps you outlined to find the number of arrangements where Mary and James do NOT sit next to each other."
1. We already know the total number of arrangements is 42.
2. The number of arrangements where they sit next to each other is 12.
"To find the number of arrangements where they do not sit next to each other, I will subtract the number of adjacent arrangements from the total arrangements:"
\[
42 \text{ (total arrangements)} - 12 \text{ (adjacent arrangements)} = 30 \text{ (non-adjacent arrangements)}
\]
"Now, to find the probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other, I will divide the number of non-adjacent arrangements by the total arrangements:"
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of non-adjacent arrangements}}{\text{Total arrangements}} = \frac{30}{42}
\]
"Next, I will simplify the fraction:"
\[
\frac{30}{42} = \frac{5}{7} \quad \text{(by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 6)}
\]
"So, the probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other is \(\frac{5}{7}\)."
Is this correct?
Teacher: Excellent work! You've subtracted 12 from 42 to get 30 non-adjacent arrangements and correctly simplified the fraction 30/42 to 5/7.
Let's review your process:
1. Found the total arrangements: 42.
2. Counted the adjacent arrangements: 12.
3. Calculated non-adjacent arrangements: 42 - 12 = 30.
"4. Computed the probability: 30/42, which simplifies to 5/7."
Your final answer is 5/7$.
