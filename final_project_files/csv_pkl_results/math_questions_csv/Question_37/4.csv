Question: Mary and James each sit in a row of 7 chairs.  They choose their seats at random.  What is the probability that they don't sit next to each other?
Teacher: Let's start by outlining the steps for solving the problem:
1. Restate the problem in your own words: We have 7 chairs in a row and Mary and James choose seats at random. We need to find the probability that they do not sit next to each other.
2. Determine the total number of possible seating arrangements for Mary and James.
3. Calculate the number of seating arrangements where Mary and James are sitting next to each other.
"4. Subtract the number of ""next to each other"" arrangements from the total arrangements to find the number of arrangements where they are not next to each other."
5. Compute the probability by dividing the number from step 4 by the total number of arrangements.
Let's begin with the first step: Can you explain or calculate the total number of ways Mary and James can choose their seats from the 7 chairs? Please work on this step and share your calculation.
Student: Sure! 
"To find the total number of ways Mary and James can choose their seats from the 7 chairs, we can think of it in two parts:"
"1. **Choose a seat for Mary:** There are 7 available chairs, so Mary has 7 options."
"2. **Choose a seat for James:** After Mary has chosen her seat, there are still 6 chairs left for James to choose from."
"So, the total number of ways for Mary and James to choose their seats is calculated by multiplying the number of choices each has:"
Total arrangements = Number of choices for Mary × Number of choices for James
Total arrangements = 7 × 6 = 42
"Therefore, there are 42 possible seating arrangements for Mary and James. "
Is this calculation correct?
"Teacher: Great job! Your explanation for the total seating arrangements is perfect. Now, let's move on to figuring out how many ways Mary and James could choose seats such that they are sitting next to each other."
"Thinking about it, consider the following:"
1. Look at the row of chairs and identify the possible pairs of adjacent chairs.
"2. For each adjacent pair, how many ways are there to assign Mary and James to those two chairs?"
Please work on describing and calculating the number of seating arrangements where they sit next to each other. What are your thoughts on this next step?
"Student: Thank you for your guidance! To calculate the number of seating arrangements where Mary and James are sitting next to each other, I’ll follow your hints."
"1. **Identify the pairs of adjacent chairs:** In a row of 7 chairs, the possible pairs of adjacent chairs are:"
"   - (1, 2)"
"   - (2, 3)"
"   - (3, 4)"
"   - (4, 5)"
"   - (5, 6)"
"   - (6, 7)"
   This gives us a total of 6 pairs of adjacent chairs.
"2. **Assigning Mary and James to these pairs:** For each pair of adjacent chairs, Mary and James can occupy those chairs in two different ways (Mary in the first chair and James in the second, or vice versa). "
"So, for each of the 6 pairs, there are 2 arrangements. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of arrangements where they sit next to each other as follows:"
Total arrangements where they sit next to each other = Number of adjacent pairs × Ways to arrange Mary and James in each pair
Total arrangements = 6 pairs × 2 arrangements per pair = 12
"Thus, there are 12 ways for Mary and James to sit next to each other. "
Is this reasoning and calculation correct?
Teacher: Great job! Your reasoning and calculation for the seating arrangements where Mary and James sit next to each other is spot on.
"Now, let's move on to the next step:"
"1. Determine the number of seating arrangements where Mary and James are not sitting next to each other (hint: subtract the 12 ""next to each other"" arrangements from the total 42 arrangements)."
"2. Then, calculate the probability by dividing the number from step 1 by the total number of arrangements."
Can you work through these two points and share your calculation for the probability that Mary and James don't sit next to each other?
Student: Sure! Let's work through the two points you've outlined:
1. **Calculate the number of arrangements where Mary and James are not sitting next to each other:**
"   We found that the total number of arrangements for Mary and James is 42, and the number of arrangements where they sit next to each other is 12. To find the number of arrangements where they are not sitting next to each other, we can subtract the ""next to each other"" arrangements from the total arrangements:"
   \[
   \text{Arrangements not next to each other} = \text{Total arrangements} - \text{Arrangements next to each other}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Arrangements not next to each other} = 42 - 12 = 30
   \]
2. **Calculate the probability that Mary and James don't sit next to each other:**
   The probability is given by the number of arrangements where they are not sitting next to each other divided by the total number of arrangements:
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Arrangements not next to each other}}{\text{Total arrangements}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{30}{42}
   \]
"   To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 6:"
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{30 \div 6}{42 \div 6} = \frac{5}{7}
   \]
"So, the probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other is \(\frac{5}{7}\)."
Is this calculation correct?
"Teacher: Excellent work! Your calculation is spot on: there are 30 seating arrangements where Mary and James do not sit next to each other, and dividing that by the total of 42 arrangements gives a probability of 30/42, which simplifies to 5/7."
"Thus, the final answer is:"
5/7$
