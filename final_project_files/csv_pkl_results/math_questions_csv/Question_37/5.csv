Question: Mary and James each sit in a row of 7 chairs.  They choose their seats at random.  What is the probability that they don't sit next to each other?
"Teacher: Let's begin by understanding the problem. We have 7 chairs in a row, and Mary and James choose their seats at random. We need to find the probability that they do not sit next to each other."
Here’s an outline of the steps we might take to solve the problem:
"1. First, determine the total number of seating arrangements for Mary and James."
"2. Then, calculate the number of arrangements where Mary and James end up sitting next to each other."
3. Subtract the count of adjacent arrangements from the total to find the number of arrangements where they are not sitting next to each other.
"4. Finally, determine the probability by dividing the number of non-adjacent arrangements by the total number of arrangements."
Let's start with step 1:
What is the total number of ways Mary and James can choose seats from 7 chairs? Please show your reasoning for this step.
"Student: To find the total number of ways Mary and James can choose seats from 7 chairs, we can think of it as follows:"
"1. **Choosing a seat for Mary**: Mary can choose any one of the 7 chairs. So, there are 7 options for Mary."
"2. **Choosing a seat for James**: After Mary has chosen her seat, James can choose from the remaining 6 chairs. So, there are 6 options for James."
"Now, to find the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of choices for Mary by the number of choices for James:"
Total arrangements = (Number of choices for Mary) × (Number of choices for James)  
Total arrangements = 7 × 6 = 42.
"So, there are 42 different ways for Mary and James to choose their seats from the 7 chairs. "
Is this reasoning correct?
Teacher: Great job! Your reasoning is spot on—the total number of seating arrangements is indeed 42.
"Now, let's move on to step 2: determining the number of arrangements where Mary and James sit next to each other. Can you work out how many seating arrangements have Mary and James sitting in adjacent seats? Please show your reasoning for this step."
"Student: Student: To determine the number of arrangements where Mary and James sit next to each other, we can think of them as a single unit or block since they are adjacent. "
"1. **Creating the block**: If we consider Mary and James as one block, we can label this block as ""MJ"" (Mary and James together). "
"2. **Counting the blocks**: With the ""MJ"" block, we now have 6 units to arrange: the ""MJ"" block and the 5 remaining chairs. "
"3. **Arranging the blocks**: The number of ways to arrange these 6 units (the ""MJ"" block + 5 chairs) is 6! (factorial of 6), but since we have two people in the block (Mary and James), we also have to consider that they can switch positions within the block. So, we have 2! arrangements for Mary and James within their block."
"Now, let's calculate:"
- The number of ways to arrange the 6 units: 6! = 720.
- The number of ways to arrange Mary and James within their block: 2! = 2.
"So, the total number of arrangements where Mary and James are sitting next to each other is:"
Total adjacent arrangements = 6! × 2! = 720 × 2 = 1440.
Is this calculation correct?
"Teacher: Your approach using a block arrangement would be appropriate in some permutation problems, but here the chairs are fixed (each chair is distinguishable). That means we need to think a bit differently."
"Hint: In a row of 7 chairs, consider how many pairs of adjacent chairs there are. Once you find that number, remember that Mary and James can switch seats in each pair. "
"So, how many adjacent pairs of seats are there in a row of 7 chairs? Please show your reasoning for this step."
Student: Student: Thank you for the hint! Let's think about how many pairs of adjacent chairs there are in a row of 7 chairs.
"In a row of 7 chairs, we can identify the pairs of adjacent chairs as follows:"
1. The first pair consists of chairs 1 and 2.
2. The second pair consists of chairs 2 and 3.
3. The third pair consists of chairs 3 and 4.
4. The fourth pair consists of chairs 4 and 5.
5. The fifth pair consists of chairs 5 and 6.
6. The sixth pair consists of chairs 6 and 7.
"So, we can see that there are a total of 6 pairs of adjacent chairs."
"Now, for each of these pairs, Mary and James can switch places. Therefore, for each pair, there are 2 arrangements (Mary can sit in the first chair of the pair, or James can sit in the first chair of the pair)."
"Now, to find the total number of arrangements where Mary and James sit next to each other, we can calculate:"
Total adjacent arrangements = Number of adjacent pairs × Number of arrangements per pair  
Total adjacent arrangements = 6 pairs × 2 arrangements per pair = 12.
"So, there are 12 different arrangements where Mary and James are sitting next to each other. Is this reasoning correct?"
Teacher: Great work on identifying that there are 6 adjacent pairs and 12 arrangements where Mary and James sit next to each other!
"Now, let's move on to step 3. We already know the total number of seating arrangements is 42 and there are 12 arrangements where they sit adjacent. "
"For step 3, please determine the number of arrangements where Mary and James are not sitting next to each other. What is 42 minus 12? Please show your reasoning for this step."
"Student: To find the number of arrangements where Mary and James are not sitting next to each other, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where they are sitting next to each other from the total number of arrangements."
We already established that:
- Total arrangements = 42
- Arrangements where they sit next to each other = 12
"Now, we can calculate the arrangements where they are not sitting next to each other:"
Arrangements where they are not adjacent = Total arrangements - Arrangements where they are adjacent  
Arrangements where they are not adjacent = 42 - 12 = 30.
"So, there are 30 different arrangements where Mary and James do not sit next to each other. Is this correct?"
Teacher: That's correct—the number of arrangements where Mary and James are not sitting next to each other is 30.
"Now, let's move to the final step: finding the probability that they don't sit next to each other. In this step, we take the number of non-adjacent arrangements (30) and divide it by the total number of arrangements (42)."
Could you please work out this division and simplify the fraction? Show your reasoning for how you simplify 30⁄42.
"Student: To find the probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other, we need to divide the number of arrangements where they are not adjacent by the total number of arrangements."
We have:
- Arrangements where they are not adjacent = 30
- Total arrangements = 42
"So, the probability \( P \) is given by:"
\[
P = \frac{\text{Number of non-adjacent arrangements}}{\text{Total arrangements}} = \frac{30}{42}
\]
"Now, we need to simplify the fraction \( \frac{30}{42} \). "
"To simplify, we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 30 and 42. The GCD is 6, since both numbers can be divided by 6:"
- \( 30 \div 6 = 5 \)
- \( 42 \div 6 = 7 \)
"Thus, we can simplify \( \frac{30}{42} \) to:"
\[
\frac{30}{42} = \frac{5}{7}
\]
"Therefore, the probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other is \( \frac{5}{7} \). "
Is this simplification correct?
"Teacher: Excellent work! Your simplification is correct, and you've arrived at the final step. The probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other is 5/7$."
