Question: Mary and James each sit in a row of 7 chairs.  They choose their seats at random.  What is the probability that they don't sit next to each other?
"Teacher: Let's start by rephrasing the problem in our own words: Mary and James will each choose one chair out of a row of 7 chairs, and we want to know the probability that they do not end up in adjacent chairs."
"To tackle this problem, we can break it into these steps:"
1. Determine the total number of ways Mary and James can sit in the 7 chairs.
2. Determine the number of ways they can sit so that they are next to each other.
3. Use these two results to find the number of seating arrangements where they are not next to each other.
"4. Finally, compute the probability by dividing the non-adjacent arrangements by the total arrangements."
Let's begin with the first step.
Step 1: How many total seating arrangements are there if Mary and James choose their seats from 7 chairs? Please share your calculation and reasoning for this step.
"Student: To find the total number of seating arrangements for Mary and James in 7 chairs, we can think about the choices each person has when selecting a chair."
1. **Choosing a Chair for Mary**: Mary can choose any of the 7 chairs.
"2. **Choosing a Chair for James**: After Mary has chosen her chair, James can choose from the remaining 6 chairs."
"So, the total number of ways they can sit in the 7 chairs is calculated as follows:"
\[
\text{Total arrangements} = 7 \times 6 = 42
\]
This means there are 42 different ways for Mary and James to choose their seats in the row of 7 chairs. 
"Is this calculation correct, and should we move on to step 2?"
Teacher: Your calculation for the total seating arrangements is correct – there are indeed 42 possible ways for Mary and James to choose their seats. Great work!
"Now, let's move on to the next step."
Step 2: We need to determine how many seating arrangements result in Mary and James sitting next to each other. Think about the following:
• How many pairs of adjacent chairs are there in a row of 7 chairs?
"• For each pair of adjacent chairs, how many ways can Mary and James be arranged in those two chairs?"
Please share your calculation and reasoning for this step.
"Student: To find the number of seating arrangements where Mary and James sit next to each other, we can follow these steps:"
"1. **Identify the Pairs of Adjacent Chairs**: In a row of 7 chairs, the pairs of adjacent chairs are:"
   - Chairs 1 and 2
   - Chairs 2 and 3
   - Chairs 3 and 4
   - Chairs 4 and 5
   - Chairs 5 and 6
   - Chairs 6 and 7
   This gives us a total of 6 pairs of adjacent chairs.
"2. **Arranging Mary and James in Each Pair**: For each pair of adjacent chairs, Mary and James can sit in 2 different ways. For example, if they are in chairs 1 and 2, Mary can sit in chair 1 and James in chair 2, or vice versa."
"   Therefore, for each of the 6 pairs, there are 2 arrangements."
Now we can calculate the total number of arrangements where Mary and James sit next to each other:
\[
\text{Total arrangements next to each other} = \text{Number of pairs} \times \text{Arrangements per pair} = 6 \times 2 = 12
\]
"So, there are 12 different ways for Mary and James to sit next to each other. "
"Is this reasoning correct, and should we proceed to step 3?"
"Teacher: Great job on step 2! Your reasoning is spot on: there are 6 pairs of adjacent chairs, and in each pair there are 2 possible arrangements for Mary and James, giving a total of 12 adjacent seating arrangements."
"Now, let's move on to step 3."
"Step 3: We need to determine the number of seating arrangements where Mary and James do NOT sit next to each other. Given that we already know the total number of arrangements (42) and the number of adjacent arrangements (12), how can you find the number of non-adjacent arrangements? Please share your calculation and reasoning."
"Student: Student: To find the number of seating arrangements where Mary and James do not sit next to each other, we can use the results from the previous steps."
We have:
- Total arrangements (from Step 1): 42
- Arrangements where they sit next to each other (from Step 2): 12
"Now, we can calculate the number of arrangements where they do not sit next to each other by subtracting the number of adjacent arrangements from the total arrangements:"
\[
\text{Non-adjacent arrangements} = \text{Total arrangements} - \text{Adjacent arrangements} = 42 - 12 = 30
\]
"So, there are 30 different ways for Mary and James to sit such that they do not sit next to each other."
"Is this calculation correct, and should we move on to the final step?"
Teacher: Your calculation for step 3 is absolutely correct! There are 30 seating arrangements where Mary and James do not sit next to each other.
"Now, let's move on to the final step."
"Step 4: To find the probability that Mary and James don't sit next to each other, you need to divide the number of non-adjacent arrangements by the total seating arrangements. Could you please work through this calculation and simplify the fraction if possible? Share your reasoning and result for this step."
"Student: To find the probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other, we will use the results from the previous steps:"
1. **Non-adjacent arrangements**: 30 (from Step 3)
2. **Total arrangements**: 42 (from Step 1)
The probability can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of non-adjacent arrangements}}{\text{Total arrangements}} = \frac{30}{42}
\]
"Next, we can simplify the fraction:"
"1. Both 30 and 42 can be divided by their greatest common divisor, which is 6."
   - \(30 \div 6 = 5\)
   - \(42 \div 6 = 7\)
"So, the simplified fraction is:"
\[
\frac{30}{42} = \frac{5}{7}
\]
"Thus, the probability that Mary and James do not sit next to each other is:"
\[
\frac{5}{7}
\]
"Is this correct, and is there anything else you would like me to add?"
Teacher: Excellent work! Your reasoning throughout each step was clear and accurate. To summarize:
1. You correctly determined that there are 42 total seating arrangements (7 choices for Mary multiplied by 6 choices for James).
"2. You then found that there are 12 arrangements where Mary and James sit next to each other (6 pairs of adjacent chairs, each with 2 orders)."
"3. By subtracting the adjacent arrangements from the total, you determined that there are 30 non-adjacent arrangements."
"4. Finally, by dividing 30 non-adjacent arrangements by 42 total arrangements and simplifying by dividing both numerator and denominator by 6, you obtained 5/7."
"Thus, the probability that Mary and James don't sit next to each other is 5/7$"
