Question: Mary and James each sit in a row of 7 chairs.  They choose their seats at random.  What is the probability that they don't sit next to each other?
"3o-mini: There are 7 chairs, and Mary and James each pick one of the chairs without sitting in the same one. "
"Total ways: 7 choices for Mary and 6 remaining choices for James, giving 7 × 6 = 42 ordered pairs."
"Next, count the ordered pairs where they are sitting next to each other. There are 6 pairs of adjacent chairs (chairs 1-2, 2-3, …, 6-7). For each such pair, there are 2 arrangements (Mary in the first chair and James in the second and vice versa), resulting in 6 × 2 = 12 ordered pairs."
"Thus, the number of ways they do NOT sit next to each other = 42 - 12 = 30."
"The probability they don't sit next to each other is 30/42, which simplifies to 5/7."
"So, the answer is 5/7."
