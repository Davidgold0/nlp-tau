"Question: The first term of a geometric sequence is 729, and the 7th term is 64. What is the positive, real value for the 5th term?"
"3o-mini: In a geometric sequence, the nth term is given by the formula:"
  aₙ = a₁ × r^(n-1)
We are given:
  a₁ = 729
  a₇ = 64
Using the formula for the 7th term:
  729 × r^(7-1) = 64
  729 × r⁶ = 64
Solve for r⁶:
  r⁶ = 64 / 729
Recognize that:
  64 = 2⁶  and  729 = 3⁶
Thus:
  r⁶ = (2⁶) / (3⁶)
Taking the sixth root of both sides:
"  r = 2/3  (or r = -2/3, but we take the positive value as requested)"
"Now, find the 5th term (a₅):"
  a₅ = 729 × r^(5-1)
  a₅ = 729 × (2/3)⁴
Calculate (2/3)⁴:
  (2/3)⁴ = 16/81
Then:
  a₅ = 729 × (16/81)
Divide 729 by 81:
  729 / 81 = 9
Therefore:
  a₅ = 9 × 16 = 144
"So, the positive, real value for the 5th term is 144."
