"Question: The first term of a geometric sequence is 729, and the 7th term is 64. What is the positive, real value for the 5th term?"
3o-mini: We start with the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence:
  aₙ = a₁ · r^(n – 1)
"Given a₁ = 729 and a₇ = 64, we substitute into the formula for a₇:"
  729 · r^(7 – 1) = 64  
  729 · r⁶ = 64
Solve for r⁶:
  r⁶ = 64 / 729
"Recognize that 64 = 2⁶ and 729 = 3⁶, so:"
  r⁶ = (2⁶) / (3⁶) = (2/3)⁶
"Since r is positive and real, we take the sixth root:"
  r = 2/3
"Now, to find the 5th term (a₅):"
  a₅ = 729 · r^(5 – 1) = 729 · (2/3)⁴
Calculate (2/3)⁴:
  (2/3)⁴ = (2⁴)/(3⁴) = 16/81
Then:
  a₅ = 729 · (16/81)
Since 729 divided by 81 equals 9:
  a₅ = 9 × 16 = 144
"Therefore, the positive, real value for the 5th term is 144."
