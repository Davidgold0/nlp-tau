"Question: The first term of a geometric sequence is 729, and the 7th term is 64. What is the positive, real value for the 5th term?"
"Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem into manageable steps. We have a geometric sequence with a first term of 729 and a 7th term of 64, and we want to find the positive, real value for the 5th term."
Step 1: Write the general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence and set up the equation using the given information (first term and the 7th term). 
"Could you please write down the general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence and then express the equation that relates the first term, the common ratio r, and the 7th term?"
Student: Sure! The general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is given by:
\[ a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{(n-1)} \]
"where \( a_n \) is the nth term, \( a_1 \) is the first term, \( r \) is the common ratio, and \( n \) is the term number."
"Given that the first term \( a_1 = 729 \) and the 7th term \( a_7 = 64 \), we can express the equation for the 7th term as follows:"
\[ a_7 = a_1 \cdot r^{(7-1)} \]
Substituting the values we have:
\[ 64 = 729 \cdot r^{6} \]
Now we can use this equation to solve for the common ratio \( r \). Would you like me to proceed with finding \( r \) from this equation?
"Teacher: Great job setting up the equation correctly! Now, let's move on to the next step."
Step 2: We need to solve for the common ratio r. Please do the following:
a. Isolate r^6 by dividing both sides of the equation 64 = 729 · r^6 by 729.
"b. Once you have r^6 expressed, take the sixth root of both sides to solve for r."
Could you please carry out these calculations and tell me what r equals?
Student: Sure! Let's follow the steps you've outlined.
Starting with the equation we set up:
\[ 64 = 729 \cdot r^{6} \]
"**Step a:** To isolate \( r^{6} \), I will divide both sides by 729:"
\[
r^{6} = \frac{64}{729}
\]
"**Step b:** Now, I will take the sixth root of both sides to solve for \( r \):"
\[
r = \sqrt[6]{\frac{64}{729}}
\]
"Now, let's simplify \( \frac{64}{729} \):"
- The sixth root of 64 is \( 2 \) (since \( 2^6 = 64 \)).
- The sixth root of 729 is \( 3 \) (since \( 3^6 = 729 \)).
"So, we have:"
\[
r = \frac{2}{3}
\]
Would you like me to proceed to find the 5th term using this value for \( r \)?
Teacher: Excellent work solving for the common ratio r! Now let's move on to the next step.
"Step 3: We need to find the 5th term of the sequence. Remember, the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is"
  aₙ = a₁ · r^(n - 1)
"For the 5th term (n = 5), the formula becomes:"
  a₅ = 729 · r^(5 - 1) = 729 · r⁴
"Since you've found r = 2/3, could you please substitute this value into the equation and simplify to find a₅? Go step by step and let me know your calculation."
Student: Sure! Let's find the 5th term step by step using the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence.
We have:
\[ a_5 = a_1 \cdot r^{(5 - 1)} \]
Substituting the values we know:
- \( a_1 = 729 \)
- \( r = \frac{2}{3} \)
"So, the equation for the 5th term becomes:"
\[ a_5 = 729 \cdot r^{4} \]
"Now, let's calculate \( r^{4} \):"
\[
r^{4} = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{4} = \frac{2^4}{3^4} = \frac{16}{81}
\]
"Now, substituting this back into the equation for \( a_5 \):"
\[
a_5 = 729 \cdot \frac{16}{81}
\]
"Next, we can simplify this expression. Since \( 729 \) can be divided by \( 81 \):"
\[
729 \div 81 = 9
\]
So we have:
\[
a_5 = 9 \cdot 16
\]
"Now, calculating \( 9 \cdot 16 \):"
\[
a_5 = 144
\]
"Thus, the positive, real value for the 5th term is:"
\[
\boxed{144}
\] 
Would you like me to clarify anything further?
Teacher: Excellent work! Your step-by-step process was perfect. To summarize what we did:
"1. We started with the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence, aₙ = a₁ · r^(n - 1), and set up the equation 64 = 729 · r⁶ using the 7th term."
2. You correctly isolated r⁶ by dividing both sides by 729 to get r⁶ = 64/729 and then found r = 2/3 by taking the sixth root.
"3. You then substituted r = 2/3 into the formula for the 5th term, yielding a₅ = 729 · (2/3)⁴ = 729 · 16/81, which simplified nicely to 144."
Great job verifying each step! Your final answer is:
144$
