"Question: The first term of a geometric sequence is 729, and the 7th term is 64. What is the positive, real value for the 5th term?"
3o-mini: The nth term of a geometric sequence is given by the formula:
  an = a₁ · r⁽ⁿ⁻¹⁾
"Here, a₁ = 729 and the 7th term is a₇ = 64, so:"
  729 · r⁶ = 64
Solving for r⁶:
  r⁶ = 64 / 729
Notice that 64 and 729 are perfect sixth powers:
  64 = 2⁶  and  729 = 3⁶
Thus:
  r⁶ = (2⁶) / (3⁶) = (2/3)⁶
"Taking the sixth root of both sides (with a positive, real r), we get:"
  r = 2/3
"Now, we want to find the 5th term:"
  a₅ = 729 · r⁴ = 729 · (2/3)⁴
Calculating (2/3)⁴:
  (2/3)⁴ = 16/81
Thus:
  a₅ = 729 · (16/81)
"Since 729 ÷ 81 = 9, we have:"
  a₅ = 9 · 16 = 144
"So the positive, real value for the 5th term is 144."
