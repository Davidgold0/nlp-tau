"Question: The first term of a geometric sequence is 729, and the 7th term is 64. What is the positive, real value for the 5th term?"
"Teacher: Alright, let’s tackle this problem step by step. To begin, let’s rephrase the problem in our own words: We have a geometric sequence where the first term is 729 and the 7th term is 64. We need to find the positive, real value of the 5th term."
Here’s an outline of the steps we’ll take:
1. Write down the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence.
2. Use the given values for the 1st and 7th terms to set up an equation to find the common ratio (r).
3. Solve the equation for r.
"4. Once we have r, use the formula to find the 5th term."
5. Simplify to get the final answer.
"Now, for the first step, can you write down the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence and then write the equation that represents the 7th term based on the given information? (Remember: the first term is 729 and the 7th term is 64.)"
Student: Sure! The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is given by:
\[ a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{(n-1)} \]
"where \( a_n \) is the nth term, \( a_1 \) is the first term, \( r \) is the common ratio, and \( n \) is the term number."
"Given that the first term \( a_1 \) is 729 and the 7th term \( a_7 \) is 64, we can set up the equation for the 7th term:"
\[ a_7 = a_1 \cdot r^{(7-1)} \]
\[ 64 = 729 \cdot r^6 \]
Now we have the equation:
\[ 64 = 729 \cdot r^6 \]
Would you like me to proceed with solving for the common ratio \( r \)?
"Teacher: Great job on setting up the equation correctly! Now, let's move on to the next step. We have the equation"
  64 = 729 · r⁶
"To solve for r, you should isolate r⁶ first and then take the appropriate root. Can you solve for the positive, real value of r (i.e., isolate r⁶ and then take the 6th root) and share your working?"
"Student: Student: Sure! To isolate \( r^6 \) in the equation \( 64 = 729 \cdot r^6 \), we can divide both sides by 729:"
\[
r^6 = \frac{64}{729}
\]
"Next, we can simplify \( \frac{64}{729} \). We know that \( 64 = 2^6 \) and \( 729 = 3^6 \), so we can rewrite the fraction as:"
\[
r^6 = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^6
\]
"Now, to find \( r \), we take the 6th root of both sides:"
\[
r = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)
\]
"So, the positive, real value for the common ratio \( r \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \). Would you like me to proceed with finding the 5th term using this value of \( r \)?"
Teacher: Great work on finding the common ratio! Now let's move on to finding the 5th term.
Recall that the nth term of a geometric sequence is given by:
  aₙ = a₁ · r^(n–1)
"For the 5th term, n = 5, so we have:"
  a₅ = 729 · r^(5–1) = 729 · r⁴
"Since we determined r = 2/3, write out the expression for a₅ using this value."
"Please calculate a₅ = 729 · (2/3)⁴, showing your steps in simplifying the exponent and then the multiplication. What's your next step?"
Student: Sure! We need to find the 5th term \( a_5 \) using the formula:
\[
a_5 = a_1 \cdot r^{(5-1)} = 729 \cdot r^4
\]
"Since we found \( r = \frac{2}{3} \), we can substitute this value into our equation:"
\[
a_5 = 729 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^4
\]
"Now, let's simplify \( \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^4 \):"
\[
\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^4 = \frac{2^4}{3^4} = \frac{16}{81}
\]
Now we can substitute this back into the equation for \( a_5 \):
\[
a_5 = 729 \cdot \frac{16}{81}
\]
"Next, we can simplify \( 729 \div 81 \):"
\[
729 \div 81 = 9
\]
So we have:
\[
a_5 = 9 \cdot 16
\]
"Now, multiplying these together gives:"
\[
a_5 = 144
\]
"Thus, the positive, real value for the 5th term is \( 144 \). Would you like me to summarize everything we've done?"
Teacher: Excellent work! Let's briefly go over the steps you followed:
1. You correctly wrote the nth term formula for a geometric sequence: aₙ = a₁ · r^(n – 1).
2. You set up the equation for the 7th term using a₇ = 729 · r⁶ and found:
  r⁶ = 64/729.
"3. Recognizing that 64 = 2⁶ and 729 = 3⁶, you deduced that r⁶ = (2/3)⁶, leading to the positive common ratio r = 2/3."
"4. Finally, you substituted r into the formula for the 5th term:"
"  a₅ = 729 · (2/3)⁴ = 729 · (16/81),"
"  simplified 729 ÷ 81 = 9, and computed a₅ = 9 · 16 = 144."
Final answer: 144$
