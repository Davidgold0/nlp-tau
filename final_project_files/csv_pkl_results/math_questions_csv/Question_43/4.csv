"Question: One of the following four-digit numbers is not divisible by 4: 3544, 3554, 3564, 3572, 3576. What is the product of the units digit and the tens digit of that number?"
Teacher: Let's start by breaking this problem down.
"We are given five four-digit numbers (3544, 3554, 3564, 3572, 3576) and asked to identify the one that is not divisible by 4. Then, once we find that number, we need to calculate the product of its tens digit and its units digit."
"To guide you, here’s the first step:"
"1. Using the rule of divisibility by 4 (remember, a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number that’s divisible by 4), check the last two digits of each of the five numbers to see which one is not divisible by 4."
Please work on that step: list the last two digits of each number and determine which number fails the divisibility test by checking if the two-digit number is divisible by 4. What do you get?
"Student: Okay, I will start by listing the last two digits of each number and then check if those two-digit numbers are divisible by 4."
"1. For 3544, the last two digits are **44**."
"2. For 3554, the last two digits are **54**."
"3. For 3564, the last two digits are **64**."
"4. For 3572, the last two digits are **72**."
"5. For 3576, the last two digits are **76**."
"Now, I will check the divisibility of each of these numbers by 4:"
- **44**: \( 44 \div 4 = 11 \) (divisible)
- **54**: \( 54 \div 4 = 13.5 \) (not divisible)
- **64**: \( 64 \div 4 = 16 \) (divisible)
- **72**: \( 72 \div 4 = 18 \) (divisible)
- **76**: \( 76 \div 4 = 19 \) (divisible)
"From this, I can see that **3554** is the number that is not divisible by 4. "
What should I do next?
Teacher: Great job! You correctly identified that 3554 is the only number that isn't divisible by 4. 
"Now, for the next step, can you determine the tens digit and the units digit of 3554, and then calculate their product? Please show your reasoning for this step."
"Student: Student: Sure! For the number **3554**, I will identify the tens digit and the units digit."
- The **units digit** is **4** (the last digit of the number).
- The **tens digit** is **5** (the second-to-last digit of the number).
"Now, to find the product of the tens digit and the units digit, I will multiply them together:"
\[
\text{Product} = \text{Tens digit} \times \text{Units digit} = 5 \times 4 = 20.
\]
"So, the product of the tens digit and the units digit of the number 3554 is **20**. "
Is there anything else you would like me to do?
Teacher: Great work! You correctly identified that 3554 is the number that isn't divisible by 4 and then determined that the tens digit is 5 and the units digit is 4. Multiplying these gives you:
5 × 4 = 20
"So, the final answer is 20$"
