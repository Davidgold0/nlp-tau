"Question: One of the following four-digit numbers is not divisible by 4: 3544, 3554, 3564, 3572, 3576. What is the product of the units digit and the tens digit of that number?"
Teacher: Let's start by rephrasing the problem:
"We have five four-digit numbers: 3544, 3554, 3564, 3572, and 3576. One of these numbers is not divisible by 4. Once we identify that number, we need to determine the product of its tens digit and its units digit."
Hereâ€™s the general plan to solve the problem:
Step 1: Recall that a number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.  
Step 2: List the last two digits of each number and check which set of digits is not divisible by 4.  
"Step 3: Once you identify the number that is not divisible by 4, determine its tens digit and units digit.  "
Step 4: Calculate the product of those two digits.
Let's begin with the first step. Can you list the last two digits for each of the given numbers and then determine which pair is not divisible by 4? Please provide your reasoning for one of the numbers first.
Student: Sure! Let's list the last two digits for each of the given numbers:
"1. For **3544**, the last two digits are **44**."
"2. For **3554**, the last two digits are **54**."
"3. For **3564**, the last two digits are **64**."
"4. For **3572**, the last two digits are **72**."
"5. For **3576**, the last two digits are **76**."
"Now, I will check if each pair is divisible by 4:"
- **44**: \( 44 \div 4 = 11\) (divisible by 4)
- **54**: \( 54 \div 4 = 13.5\) (not divisible by 4)
- **64**: \( 64 \div 4 = 16\) (divisible by 4)
- **72**: \( 72 \div 4 = 18\) (divisible by 4)
- **76**: \( 76 \div 4 = 19\) (divisible by 4)
"From this, I can see that **3554** is the number that is not divisible by 4. "
Would you like me to proceed with determining the tens digit and units digit of 3554?
"Teacher: Great work! You correctly identified that the number 3554 is not divisible by 4, because its last two digits, 54, do not divide evenly by 4. "
"Now, let's move to the next step. Please determine the tens digit and the units digit of 3554. What are those digits, and what reasoning do you use to extract them?"
"Student: Student: Thank you! The last two digits of 3554 are **54**, so we can extract the tens digit and the units digit from there. "
- The **tens digit** is **5** (the first digit of 54).
- The **units digit** is **4** (the second digit of 54).
"To summarize, the tens digit of 3554 is **5**, and the units digit is **4**. "
Shall I now calculate the product of these two digits?
"Teacher: Good job identifying the tens digit as 5 and the units digit as 4 from the number 3554. Now, please calculate the product of these two digits. What is 5 multiplied by 4? Explain your reasoning step-by-step."
"Student: Student: Sure! To calculate the product of the tens digit (5) and the units digit (4), I will perform the multiplication step-by-step:"
1. Start with the tens digit: **5**.
2. Multiply it by the units digit: **4**.
"3. So, the calculation is: \( 5 \times 4 \)."
"Now, performing the multiplication:"
- \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \).
"Therefore, the product of the tens digit and the units digit of the number 3554 is **20**. "
Is there anything else you would like me to clarify or do?
"Teacher: Excellent work! You correctly determined that 3554 is the number not divisible by 4, extracted the tens digit (5) and units digit (4), and then calculated their product. Your reasoning throughout the steps was clear and accurate."
The final answer is 20$
