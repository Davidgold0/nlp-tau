"Question: One of the following four-digit numbers is not divisible by 4: 3544, 3554, 3564, 3572, 3576. What is the product of the units digit and the tens digit of that number?"
"3o-mini: To determine whether a number is divisible by 4, check if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4."
"• For 3544, the last two digits are 44. Since 44 ÷ 4 = 11, it is divisible by 4."
"• For 3554, the last two digits are 54. Since 54 ÷ 4 = 13.5, it is not divisible by 4."
"• For 3564, the last two digits are 64. Since 64 ÷ 4 = 16, it is divisible by 4."
"• For 3572, the last two digits are 72. Since 72 ÷ 4 = 18, it is divisible by 4."
"• For 3576, the last two digits are 76. Since 76 ÷ 4 = 19, it is divisible by 4."
So the number that is not divisible by 4 is 3554.
"Now, the tens digit of 3554 is 5 (the second digit from the right) and the units digit is 4. Their product is 5 × 4 = 20."
