"Question: One of the following four-digit numbers is not divisible by 4: 3544, 3554, 3564, 3572, 3576. What is the product of the units digit and the tens digit of that number?"
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down what the problem is asking:
"We are given five four-digit numbers: 3544, 3554, 3564, 3572, and 3576. One of these numbers is not divisible by 4. After identifying that number, we need to take its tens digit and its units digit and multiply them together."
Here are the steps to solve the problem:
1. Understand Divisibility by 4: A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.
"2. For each of the five numbers, look at its last two digits and determine whether that two-digit number is divisible by 4."
3. Identify the number that is not divisible by 4.
4. Extract the tens digit and the units digit from that number.
5. Calculate the product of these two digits.
Let’s begin with step 1. Can you explain the rule for divisibility by 4 and then apply that rule to one of the numbers by checking its last two digits? Please share your thought process for this step.
Student: Sure! The rule for divisibility by 4 states that a number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4. 
"Now, let’s apply this rule to the first number, which is 3544. The last two digits are 44. "
"To check if 44 is divisible by 4, I can divide 44 by 4:"
44 ÷ 4 = 11
"Since 11 is a whole number, this means that 44 is divisible by 4. Therefore, 3544 is divisible by 4."
"What should I do next? Would you like me to check the next number, 3554?"
"Teacher: Great work explaining the divisibility rule and applying it to 3544! Now, let's move on to the next number: 3554. "
For 3554:
1. Identify the last two digits.
2. Determine if these two digits form a number divisible by 4.
3. Show your calculation and explain your reasoning.
Please go ahead and work through this step.
"Student: Student: Thank you! For the number 3554, the last two digits are 54."
"Now, I'll check if 54 is divisible by 4 by dividing it by 4:"
54 ÷ 4 = 13.5
"Since 13.5 is not a whole number, this means that 54 is not divisible by 4. Therefore, 3554 is not divisible by 4."
What should I do next? Should I continue checking the remaining numbers or focus on 3554 since we found the one that is not divisible by 4?
Teacher: Great job identifying that 3554 is not divisible by 4 by checking its last two digits!
"Now, let's move on to the next step: we need to extract the tens digit and the units digit of 3554, and then find the product of these two digits."
What are the tens and units digits of 3554? Please show your thought process on extracting these digits and calculating their product.
Student: Student: Thank you for your guidance! The number 3554 has the following digits:
- The tens digit is 5 (the second to last digit).
- The units digit is 4 (the last digit).
"Now, to find the product of the tens digit and the units digit, I will multiply them together:"
5 (tens digit) × 4 (units digit) = 20.
"So, the product of the tens digit and the units digit of the number 3554 is 20. "
Is there anything else you would like me to do?
"Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly identified that 3554 is not divisible by 4, and then correctly extracted the tens digit (5) and the units digit (4) to calculate their product as 20."
To summarize our approach:
1. We used the rule for divisibility by 4 (checking if the number formed by the last two digits is divisible by 4).
2. We applied this rule to each number until we found that 3554 was not divisible by 4.
3. We then extracted the tens and units digits of 3554 and calculated their product (5 × 4 = 20).
The final answer is 20$
