"Question: One of the following four-digit numbers is not divisible by 4: 3544, 3554, 3564, 3572, 3576. What is the product of the units digit and the tens digit of that number?"
"3o-mini: To check if a number is divisible by 4, we only need to look at its last two digits. A number is divisible by 4 if and only if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4."
"• For 3544, the last two digits are 44, and 44 ÷ 4 = 11, so it's divisible by 4."
"• For 3554, the last two digits are 54, and 54 ÷ 4 = 13.5, which is not an integer, so it's not divisible by 4."
"• The remaining numbers (3564, 3572, 3576) are all divisible by 4 because:"
"  - 3564 → 64 ÷ 4 = 16,"
"  - 3572 → 72 ÷ 4 = 18,"
  - 3576 → 76 ÷ 4 = 19.
"Since 3554 is the only number not divisible by 4, we consider its tens and units digits. The tens digit is the second-to-last digit and the units digit is the last digit."
For 3554:
  - Tens digit = 5
  - Units digit = 4
Their product is 5 × 4 = 20.
"Thus, the answer is 20."
