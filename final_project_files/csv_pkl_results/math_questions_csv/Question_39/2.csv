Question: Let $S$ be the increasing sequence of positive integers whose binary representation has exactly $8$ ones. Let $N$ be the 1000th number in $S$. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.
"Teacher: Let’s start by understanding the structure of the problem. We are given the sequence S of all positive integers whose binary representations have exactly 8 ones. In increasing order the first few numbers come from numbers with 8 bits, then 9 bits, etc. Our goal is to find the 1000th such number N and then compute N mod 1000."
Here is a plan of attack:
"1. Determine for each possible bit‐length (starting with 8 bits, since that’s the minimum needed for 8 ones) how many numbers with exactly 8 ones there are. (Remember: For a number with i bits, the most significant bit is always 1, so you only choose the remaining 7 ones among the i–1 lower positions.)"
"2. Sum these counts until you go past 1000. This determines the bit‐length of the 1000th number. Then, determine the “offset” of the 1000th number within the block of numbers with that many bits."
"3. Once you know that the 1000th number is, say, an i-bit number and its position among the numbers with i bits, set up a method (using the idea of “combinatorial ranking” or the “greedy digit determination” process) to determine which positions (among the lower i–1 bits) are 1’s."
"4. Finally, compute the value of the number and then find its remainder when divided by 1000."
"Now, let’s begin with the first step."
"Step 1: Determine how many i‑bit numbers (i ≥ 8) have exactly 8 one’s. For an i‑bit number, since the most significant bit is fixed to 1, you are choosing the remaining 7 one’s among the remaining i – 1 positions."
 
"What is the number (the count) for i = 8, then for i = 9, and so on? Please go ahead and compute the count for i = 8 and i = 9, and then share your answer."
"Student: To find the number of \(i\)-bit integers with exactly 8 ones, we will use the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\), which counts the ways to choose \(k\) positions from \(n\). "
### Step 1: Count for \(i = 8\)
For \(i = 8\):
"- Since the most significant bit is fixed as 1, we need to choose the remaining 7 ones from the remaining \(8 - 1 = 7\) positions."
"- Therefore, the count is given by:"
\[
\text{Count for } i = 8 = \binom{7}{7} = 1
\]
### Step 2: Count for \(i = 9\)
For \(i = 9\):
"- The most significant bit is still 1, and we choose 7 ones from the remaining \(9 - 1 = 8\) positions."
"- Therefore, the count is given by:"
\[
\text{Count for } i = 9 = \binom{8}{7} = 8
\]
### Summary of Counts
- For \(i = 8\): 1 number
- For \(i = 9\): 8 numbers
"Next, we need to continue this process for \(i = 10\) and \(i = 11\) to see how many more numbers we can count until we exceed 1000. Would you like me to proceed with those calculations?"
Teacher: Great work on computing the counts for i = 8 and i = 9! Your answers—1 for i = 8 and 8 for i = 9—are correct.
"Now, let’s move on to the next step in our plan. We need to similarly compute the count for numbers with 10 bits and 11 bits."
"Remember, for an i‑bit number with exactly 8 ones, the most significant bit is fixed as 1 and you choose the remaining 7 ones from the remaining i – 1 positions. "
Could you please calculate:
1. The count for i = 10 (using the appropriate binomial coefficient)
2. The count for i = 11
Take your time with these calculations and then share your results.
Student: Sure! Let's continue with the calculations for \(i = 10\) and \(i = 11\).
### Step 3: Count for \(i = 10\)
For \(i = 10\):
"- The most significant bit is fixed as 1, so we need to choose 7 ones from the remaining \(10 - 1 = 9\) positions."
- The count is given by:
\[
\text{Count for } i = 10 = \binom{9}{7} = \binom{9}{2} = \frac{9 \times 8}{2 \times 1} = 36
\]
### Step 4: Count for \(i = 11\)
For \(i = 11\):
"- The most significant bit is fixed as 1, and we choose 7 ones from the remaining \(11 - 1 = 10\) positions."
- The count is given by:
\[
\text{Count for } i = 11 = \binom{10}{7} = \binom{10}{3} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 120
\]
### Summary of Counts
- For \(i = 8\): 1 number
- For \(i = 9\): 8 numbers
- For \(i = 10\): 36 numbers
- For \(i = 11\): 120 numbers
"Now, let’s sum these counts to see how many numbers we have so far:"
- Total for \(i = 8\) to \(i = 9\): \(1 + 8 = 9\)
- Total for \(i = 10\): \(9 + 36 = 45\)
- Total for \(i = 11\): \(45 + 120 = 165\)
"Next, we need to calculate for \(i = 12\) and \(i = 13\) to see when we exceed 1000. Would you like me to proceed with those calculations?"
Teacher: Great work so far! You've correctly computed and summed the counts for i = 8 through i = 11. Now we'll move to the next step.
Step 2 now involves adding more counts from numbers with higher bit-lengths until we exceed 1000 total numbers. Please continue by computing:
"1. The count for i = 12 (remember, it will be C(11, 7))."
"2. The count for i = 13 (which will be C(12, 7))."
"After obtaining these, add them to your previous cumulative total (which is 165 for i = 8 through i = 11) to see how many numbers have been counted so far."
Please work out these calculations and share your results.
Student: Sure! Let's compute the counts for \(i = 12\) and \(i = 13\).
### Step 5: Count for \(i = 12\)
For \(i = 12\):
"- The most significant bit is fixed as 1, so we need to choose 7 ones from the remaining \(12 - 1 = 11\) positions."
- The count is given by:
\[
\text{Count for } i = 12 = \binom{11}{7} = \binom{11}{4} = \frac{11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 330
\]
### Step 6: Count for \(i = 13\)
For \(i = 13\):
"- The most significant bit is fixed as 1, and we choose 7 ones from the remaining \(13 - 1 = 12\) positions."
- The count is given by:
\[
\text{Count for } i = 13 = \binom{12}{7} = \binom{12}{5} = \frac{12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 792
\]
### Summary of Counts
- For \(i = 12\): 330 numbers
- For \(i = 13\): 792 numbers
### Cumulative Total
"Now, let's add these counts to our previous cumulative total of 165:"
- Total for \(i = 12\): \(165 + 330 = 495\)
- Total for \(i = 13\): \(495 + 792 = 1287\)
"At this point, we have 1287 numbers when we include the counts up to \(i = 13\), which exceeds 1000. Therefore, the 1000th number must be one of the numbers with 13 bits."
### Next Steps
"Since we know the 1000th number is an \(i = 13\) bit number, we need to find its position among the numbers with 13 bits. The count of numbers with 12 bits is 495, so the offset of the 1000th number within the 13-bit numbers is:"
\[
1000 - 495 = 505
\]
Now we need to find the 505th number among the 13-bit integers with exactly 8 ones. Would you like me to proceed with finding that number?
"Teacher: Great! Your calculations are perfect, and you've identified that the 1000th number is a 13‑bit number. We also correctly determined its offset: the 1000th number is the 505th number among the 13‑bit numbers (since we had 495 numbers with fewer than 13 bits)."
"Now we move to the next step: finding the actual binary structure of the 13‑bit number. Remember, for a 13‑bit number with exactly 8 ones, its most significant bit is fixed as 1. This leaves us 12 remaining bit positions in which we must place 7 ones. We need to determine which 7 positions (out of these 12) are 1’s such that the number is the 505th in the increasing order of these combinations."
"To do this, we can use a combinatorial ranking (or ""greedy digit determination"") method. Here’s how you might approach it:"
1. Consider the 12 positions (from left to right) where we can place our 7 ones.
"2. For the first (leftmost) of these 12 positions, check how many combinations would be formed if that position were 0 (i.e., we skip placing a 1 there). That number is given by the binomial coefficient C(remaining positions after this, still need 7 ones).  "
3. Compare that count with the offset (505).  
"   - If the number of combinations with a 0 in that position is at least 505, then the 1 does not go into that position.  "
"   - Otherwise, it means that the first digit must be 1, so subtract the count from the offset and reduce the number of ones required, and then move to the next position."
4. Continue this process for each of the remaining 12 positions until you have chosen all 7 positions for the ones.
For our first decision:  
"- The current parameters are: 12 available positions, 7 ones to place, offset = 505.  "
- Look at the leftmost position (position 12 if we number positions 1 to 12 from the left).  
"- If we set this bit to 0, then the number of ways to choose 7 ones from the remaining 11 positions is C(11,7). Can you compute C(11,7) and then decide whether the 1 should be placed here or not based on the offset of 505? "
Please give that computation and explain your reasoning for the decision on the leftmost of the 12 positions.
"Student: To determine whether we should place a 1 in the leftmost position (position 12) of our 13-bit number, we need to compute the number of combinations of placing 7 ones in the remaining positions if we set the leftmost position to 0."
"### Step 1: Calculate \(C(11, 7)\)"
We want to find the number of ways to choose 7 ones from 11 positions:
\[
"C(11, 7) = C(11, 4) = \frac{11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}"
\]
Calculating this:
\[
"C(11, 4) = \frac{11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8}{24} = \frac{7920}{24} = 330"
\]
### Step 2: Compare with the Offset
Now we compare this count (330) with our current offset (505):
"- Since \(330 < 505\), this means that if we set the leftmost position (position 12) to 0, there are not enough combinations to reach the 505th number. Thus, we must place a 1 in this position."
### Update the Parameters
"Now that we have placed a 1 in the leftmost position (position 12), we update our parameters:"
"- We have used one 1, so we now need to place 6 ones in the remaining 11 positions."
- The new offset will be:
\[
505 - 330 = 175
\]
### Step 3: Move to the Next Position
"We now look at the next position (position 11) and need to compute \(C(10, 6)\) to see how many combinations we can form if we set this position to 0."
"### Calculate \(C(10, 6)\)"
Calculating:
\[
"C(10, 6) = C(10, 4) = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}"
\]
Calculating this:
\[
"C(10, 4) = \frac{5040}{24} = 210"
\]
### Step 4: Compare with the Updated Offset
Now we compare this count (210) with our updated offset (175):
"- Since \(210 > 175\), we do not place a 1 in position 11. We set this position to 0."
### Update the Parameters Again
"Now we move to position 10. We still need to place 6 ones in the remaining 10 positions, and the offset remains 175."
### Step 5: Move to Position 10
"Now we compute \(C(9, 6)\) to see how many combinations we can form if we set position 10 to 0."
"### Calculate \(C(9, 6)\)"
Calculating:
\[
"C(9, 6) = C(9, 3) = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{504}{6} = 84"
\]
### Step 6: Compare with the Updated Offset
Now we compare this count (84) with our offset (175):
"- Since \(84 < 175\), we must place a 1 in position 10."
### Update the Parameters Again
"Now we have placed a 1 in position 10, so we need to place 5 ones in the remaining 9 positions. The new offset is:"
\[
175 - 84 = 91
\]
### Step 7: Move to Position 9
"Next, we compute \(C(8, 5)\) to see how many combinations we can form if we set position 9 to 0."
"### Calculate \(C(8, 5)\)"
Calculating:
\[
"C(8, 5) = C(8, 3) = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{336}{6} = 56"
\]
### Step 8: Compare with the Updated Offset
Now we compare this count (56) with our updated offset (91):
"- Since \(56 < 91\), we must place a 1 in position 9."
### Update the Parameters Again
Now we have placed a 1 in position 9. We need to place 4 ones in the remaining 8 positions. The new offset is:
\[
91 - 56 = 35
\]
### Step 9: Move to Position 8
"Next, we compute \(C(7, 4)\) to see how many combinations we can form if we set position 8 to 0."
"### Calculate \(C(7, 4)\)"
Calculating:
\[
"C(7, 4) = C(7, 3) = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{210}{6} = 35"
\]
### Step 10: Compare with the Updated Offset
Now we compare this count (35) with our updated offset (35):
"- Since \(35 = 35\), we can set position 8 to 0."
### Update the Parameters Again
Now we have placed a 1 in position 8. We need to place 3 ones in the remaining 7 positions. The new offset is:
\[
35 - 35 = 0
\]
### Step 11: Move to Position 7
"Next, we compute \(C(6, 3)\) to see how many combinations we can form if we set position 7 to 0."
"### Calculate \(C(6, 3)\)"
Calculating:
\[
"C(6, 3) = \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{120}{6} = 20"
\]
### Step 12: Compare with the Updated Offset
Now we compare this count (20) with our updated offset (0):
"- Since \(0 < 20\), we must place a 1 in position 7."
### Update the Parameters Again
Now we have placed a 1 in position 7. We need to place 2 ones in the remaining 6 positions. The offset remains 0.
### Step 13: Move to Position 6
"Next, we compute \(C(5, 2)\) to see how many combinations we can form if we set position 6 to 0."
"### Calculate \(C(5, 2)\)"
Calculating:
\[
"C(5, 2) = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10"
\]
### Step 14: Compare with the Updated Offset
Now we compare this count (10) with our updated offset (0):
"- Since \(0 < 10\), we must place a 1 in position 6."
### Update the Parameters Again
Now we have placed a 1 in position 6. We need to place 1 one in the remaining 5 positions. The offset remains 0.
### Step 15: Move to Position 5
"Next, we compute \(C(4, 1)\) to see how many combinations we can form if we set position 5 to 0."
"### Calculate \(C(4, 1)\)"
Calculating:
\[
"C(4, 1) = 4"
\]
### Step 16: Compare with the Updated Offset
Now we compare this count (4) with our updated offset (0):
"- Since \(0 < 4\), we must place a 1 in position 5."
### Update the Parameters Again
Now we have placed a 1 in position 5. We need to place 0 ones in the remaining 4 positions. The offset remains 0.
### Step 17: Move to Position 4
"Next, we compute \(C(3, 0)\) to see how many combinations we can form if we set position 4 to 0."
"### Calculate \(C(3, 0)\)"
Calculating:
\[
"C(3, 0) = 1"
\]
### Step 18: Compare with the Updated Offset
Now we compare this count (1) with our updated offset (0):
"- Since \(0 < 1\), we must place a 1 in position 4."
### Final Positions
"At this stage, we have determined the positions of the 1's in the 13-bit number:"
"- Positions with 1's: 12, 10, 9, 7, 6, 5, 4"
"- Positions with 0's: 11, 8, 3, 2, 1, 0"
### Constructing the Binary Number
Now we construct the binary number from the positions identified:
"- The binary number has 13 bits, with 1's in positions 12, 10, 9, 7, 6, 5, and 4."
"Writing it out, we have:"
- 1 (at position 12)
- 0 (at position 11)
- 1 (at position 10)
- 1 (at position 9)
- 0 (at position 8)
- 1 (at position 7)
- 1 (at position 6)
- 1 (at position 5)
- 0 (at position 4)
- 0 (at position 3)
- 0 (at position 2)
- 0 (at position 1)
- 0 (at position 0)
This gives us the binary representation:
\[
N = 1011101100000_2
\]
### Convert to Decimal
Now we convert \(N\) to decimal:
\[
N = 1 \cdot 2^{12} + 0 \cdot 2^{11} + 1 \cdot 2^{10} + 1 \cdot 2^{9} + 0 \cdot 2^{8} + 1 \cdot 2^{7} + 1 \cdot 2^{6} + 1 \cdot 2^{5} + 0 \cdot 2^{4} + 0 \cdot 2^{3} + 0 \cdot 2^{2} + 0 \cdot 2^{1} + 0 \cdot 2^{0}
\]
Calculating:
\[
N = 4096 + 0 + 1024 + 512 + 0 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4096 + 1024 + 512 + 128 + 64 + 32 = 5856
\]
### Final Step: Find \(N \mod 1000\)
"Finally, we find the remainder when \(N\) is divided by 1000:"
\[
5856 \mod 1000 = 856
\]
"Thus, the remainder when \(N\) is divided by 1000 is:"
\[
\boxed{856}
\]
"Teacher: You did a lot of work here, and many of your initial steps were correct. However, when you reached the stage of “greedy digit determination” for the 13‐bit number, the decisions for some bit placements seem inconsistent. Remember our overall plan:"
"• We have a 13‑bit number with its most significant bit fixed as 1. That leaves 12 positions (from left to right, corresponding to bit‑positions 11 down to 0) in which we must choose 7 ones.  "
"• We are looking for the 505th combination (when counted in increasing order by value) among these 792 (that is, 12 choose 7) possibilities.  "
"• In our 1‑indexed ranking process, for each available bit we do the following:  "
"  – Compute count = C(remaining positions, ones still needed).  "
"  – If the current offset is greater than count, then we set the current bit to 1, subtract the count from the offset, and reduce the number of ones needed; otherwise, we set the bit to 0 and continue with the same offset and ones needed."
"Let’s review the first few decisions together using this method (with the available 12 positions, ones needed = 7, and initial offset = 505):"
1. For the very first available bit (the leftmost of the 12 positions):  
" – Available positions = 11, ones needed = 7.  "
" – Count = C(11,7) = 330.  "
"  Since 505 > 330, we set this bit to 1 and update offset to 505 – 330 = 175 (ones remaining become 6)."
2. For the next available bit:  
" – Now available positions = 10, ones needed = 6.  "
" – Count = C(10,6) = 210.  "
"  Since 175 ≤ 210, we set this bit to 0 (offset remains 175, ones still 6)."
3. Next available bit:  
" – Available positions = 9, ones needed = 6.  "
" – Count = C(9,6) = 84.  "
"  Since 175 > 84, we set this bit to 1, subtract 84 making offset = 175 – 84 = 91, and decrease ones needed to 5."
4. Next available bit:  
" – Now available positions = 8, ones needed = 5.  "
" – Count = C(8,5) = 56.  "
"  Since 91 > 56, set this bit to 1, update offset = 91 – 56 = 35, ones needed become 4."
"Now when you reach the next available bit (fifth in the order, corresponding to the next highest unused bit), you’ll want to carefully compare the updated offset with the corresponding binomial coefficient. (For example, with available positions = 7 and ones needed = 4, the count is C(7,4) = 35.) Notice here that if the offset is exactly equal to that count, then according to our 1‑indexed rule, you do NOT choose the 0 branch (since the rule is “if offset > count then choose 1; otherwise, choose 0”). In this case, offset 35 is not greater than 35, so you should set that bit to 0 and keep offset = 35 with ones still = 4."
Please go back over your decisions from this point onward (starting at the fifth available bit) using the following template for each bit:
 a. Note the number of remaining positions and the ones still needed.
" b. Compute count = C(remaining positions, ones still needed)."
" c. If your current offset > count, then set the bit to 1, subtract count from the offset, and reduce the ones needed."
" d. Otherwise, set the bit to 0 (with no change to the offset or ones needed)."
Could you please rework the bit–by–bit determination for the 12 available positions (after the fixed MSB) using this method and then share your updated binary string for the 13‐bit number?
"Student: Sure! Let's carefully re-evaluate the positions of the bits in the 13-bit number step by step, following the method you've outlined."

    - Offset remains 1 (ones still needed = 0).
### Final Bit Positions
Now we have the positions of the 1's:
"- Set bits: 12, 10, 9, 7, 6, 5, 4"
"- Unset bits: 11, 8, 3, 2, 1, 0"
### Constructing the Binary Number
The binary representation of the number is:
- 1 (at position 12)
- 0 (at position 11)
- 1 (at position 10)
- 1 (at position 9)
- 0 (at position 8)
- 1 (at position 7)
- 1 (at position 6)
- 1 (at position 5)
- 0 (at position 4)
- 0 (at position 3)
- 0 (at position 2)
- 0 (at position 1)
- 0 (at position 0)
"Thus, the binary number is:"
\[
N = 1011101100000_2
\]
### Convert to Decimal
Now we convert \(N\) to decimal:
\[
N = 1 \cdot 2^{12} + 0 \cdot 2^{11} + 1 \cdot 2^{10} + 1 \cdot 2^{9} + 0 \cdot 2^{8} + 1 \cdot 2^{7} + 1 \cdot 2^{6} + 1 \cdot 2^{5} + 0 \cdot 2^{4} + 0 \cdot 2^{3} + 0 \cdot 2^{2} + 0 \cdot 2^{1} + 0 \cdot 2^{0}
\]
Calculating:
\[
N = 4096 + 0 + 1024 + 512 + 0 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 5856
\]
### Final Step: Find \(N \mod 1000\)
"Finally, we find the remainder when \(N\) is divided by 1000:"
\[
5856 \mod 1000 = 856
\]
"Thus, the remainder when \(N\) is divided by 1000 is:"
\[
\boxed{856}
\]
Teacher: Excellent effort in re‐working the procedure! Let’s make sure we’re clear on the method before proceeding:
"We have a 13‐bit number whose most significant bit (bit 12) is fixed to 1. That leaves 12 available positions (bits 11 down to 0) in which we must choose exactly 7 ones. We want the 505th combination (when the 13‑bit numbers are listed in increasing order) among the C(12, 7) = 792 possibilities."
"The method is as follows, and we will work bit by bit through the 12 available positions:"
" 1. Begin with offset = 505, ones needed = 7, and positions remaining = 12 (starting from bit 11—the next bit after the fixed MSB—down to bit 0)."
 2. For each available position (from bit 11 down to bit 0) do:
"  a. Compute count = C(remaining positions – 1, ones needed). (This count gives the number of combinations if we set the current bit to 0.)"
"  b. If your current offset is greater than this count, then you “use up” those combinations by setting the current bit to 1. In that case, subtract count from the offset and reduce the ones needed by 1."
  c. Otherwise (if the offset is less than or equal to count) set the current bit to 0 and do not change the offset or the ones needed.
  d. Decrease the number of positions remaining by 1.
Let’s apply this step by step starting from bit 11:
Step 1 (bit 11):
 - Positions remaining after this: 11
 - Ones needed = 7
" - Compute count = C(11, 7) = 330."
" - Since 505 > 330, set bit 11 = 1."
 - Update offset: 505 – 330 = 175.
 - New ones needed = 6.
Step 2 (bit 10):
" - Now positions remaining = 10, ones needed = 6."
" - Compute count = C(10, 6) = 210."
" - Since 175 ≤ 210, set bit 10 = 0."
" - Offset remains 175, ones needed still 6."
Step 3 (bit 9):
" - Positions remaining = 9, ones needed = 6."
" - Compute count = C(9, 6) = 84."
" - Since 175 > 84, set bit 9 = 1."
 - Update offset: 175 – 84 = 91.
 - New ones needed = 5.
Step 4 (bit 8):
" - Positions remaining = 8, ones needed = 5."
" - Compute count = C(8, 5) = 56."
" - Since 91 > 56, set bit 8 = 1."
 - Update offset: 91 – 56 = 35.
 - New ones needed = 4.
Step 5 (bit 7):
" - Positions remaining = 7, ones needed = 4."
" - Compute count = C(7, 4) = 35."
" - Now, since the offset (35) is NOT greater than 35 (it is equal), you set bit 7 = 0."
" - Offset remains 35, and ones needed remains 4."
Step 6 (bit 6):
" - Positions remaining = 6, ones needed = 4."
" - Compute count = C(6, 4) = 15."
" - Since 35 > 15, set bit 6 = 1."
 - Update offset: 35 – 15 = 20.
 - New ones needed = 3.
Step 7 (bit 5):
" - Positions remaining = 5, ones needed = 3."
" - Compute count = C(5, 3) = 10."
" - Since 20 > 10, set bit 5 = 1."
 - Update offset: 20 – 10 = 10.
 - New ones needed = 2.
Step 8 (bit 4):
" - Positions remaining = 4, ones needed = 2."
" - Compute count = C(4, 2) = 6."
" - Since 10 > 6, set bit 4 = 1."
 - Update offset: 10 – 6 = 4.
 - New ones needed = 1.
Step 9 (bit 3):
" - Positions remaining = 3, ones needed = 1."
" - Compute count = C(3, 1) = 3."
" - Since 4 > 3, set bit 3 = 1."
 - Update offset: 4 – 3 = 1.
 - New ones needed = 0.
"For the remaining bits (bit 2, bit 1, and bit 0) there are no ones left to place; they will all be 0."
"Now, remember to include the fixed most significant bit (bit 12, which is 1). So the complete 13‑bit binary number is made up as follows:"
 • Bit 12: 1 (fixed)
 • Bit 11: 1  
 • Bit 10: 0  
 • Bit 9: 1  
 • Bit 8: 1  
 • Bit 7: 0  
 • Bit 6: 1  
 • Bit 5: 1  
 • Bit 4: 1  
 • Bit 3: 1  
 • Bit 2: 0  
 • Bit 1: 0  
 • Bit 0: 0
This gives the binary representation:  
  1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0
"Now, I’d like you to carefully verify these steps and then convert this binary number to its decimal form. Finally, compute the remainder when that decimal number is divided by 1000."
Please work through the conversion and the final modulo calculation. Let me know your result and reasoning for that final step.
Student: Sure! Let's convert the binary representation \(N = 1101101111000_2\) to decimal and then compute the remainder when that decimal number is divided by 1000.
### Step 1: Convert Binary to Decimal
"To convert the binary number \(1101101111000_2\) to decimal, we evaluate each bit as follows:"
\[
N = 1 \cdot 2^{12} + 1 \cdot 2^{11} + 0 \cdot 2^{10} + 1 \cdot 2^{9} + 1 \cdot 2^{8} + 0 \cdot 2^{7} + 1 \cdot 2^{6} + 1 \cdot 2^{5} + 1 \cdot 2^{4} + 0 \cdot 2^{3} + 0 \cdot 2^{2} + 0 \cdot 2^{1} + 0 \cdot 2^{0}
\]
Calculating each term:
- \(1 \cdot 2^{12} = 4096\)
- \(1 \cdot 2^{11} = 2048\)
- \(0 \cdot 2^{10} = 0\)
- \(1 \cdot 2^{9} = 512\)
- \(1 \cdot 2^{8} = 256\)
- \(0 \cdot 2^{7} = 0\)
- \(1 \cdot 2^{6} = 64\)
- \(1 \cdot 2^{5} = 32\)
- \(1 \cdot 2^{4} = 16\)
- \(0 \cdot 2^{3} = 0\)
- \(0 \cdot 2^{2} = 0\)
- \(0 \cdot 2^{1} = 0\)
- \(0 \cdot 2^{0} = 0\)
"Now, summing these values:"
\[
N = 4096 + 2048 + 0 + 512 + 256 + 0 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0
\]
Calculating the total:
\[
N = 4096 + 2048 + 512 + 256 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 5856
\]
### Step 2: Compute \(N \mod 1000\)
"Now, we need to find the remainder when \(N = 5856\) is divided by 1000:"
\[
5856 \mod 1000 = 856
\]
### Final Answer
"Thus, the remainder when \(N\) is divided by 1000 is:"
\[
\boxed{856}
\]
Teacher: Great work on following the method step by step! Let's review your conversion carefully to ensure we get the correct decimal value.
Your determined 13‑bit binary number (with the fixed MSB at bit 12) was:
 Bit 12: 1  
 Bit 11: 1  
 Bit 10: 0  
 Bit 9: 1  
 Bit 8: 1  
 Bit 7: 0  
 Bit 6: 1  
 Bit 5: 1  
 Bit 4: 1  
 Bit 3: 1  
 Bit 2: 0  
 Bit 1: 0  
 Bit 0: 0  
This gives the binary string: 1101101111000₂
"Now, to convert this to decimal we need to add the value of each bit that is 1. Recall that the leftmost bit (bit 12) corresponds to 2¹², the next to 2¹¹, and so on. Let’s list the contributions:"
 • Bit 12 (1): 2¹² = 4096  
 • Bit 11 (1): 2¹¹ = 2048  
 • Bit 10 (0): contributes 0  
 • Bit 9 (1): 2⁹ = 512  
 • Bit 8 (1): 2⁸ = 256  
 • Bit 7 (0): contributes 0  
 • Bit 6 (1): 2⁶ = 64  
 • Bit 5 (1): 2⁵ = 32  
 • Bit 4 (1): 2⁴ = 16  
 • Bit 3 (1): 2³ = 8  
" • Bits 2, 1, 0 (0’s): contribute 0"
Adding these together:
 4096 + 2048 = 6144  
 6144 + 512 = 6656  
 6656 + 256 = 6912  
 6912 + 64 = 6976  
 6976 + 32 = 7008  
 7008 + 16 = 7024  
 7024 + 8 = 7032
So the decimal value of your number is 7032.
"Finally, to get N mod 1000, we compute:"
 7032 mod 1000 = 32
Your final answer should be 32.

\]
Calculating each term:
- \(1 \cdot 2^{12} = 4096\)
- \(1 \cdot 2^{11} = 2048\)

- \(1 \cdot 2^{6} = 64\)
- \(1 \cdot 2^{5} = 32\)
- \(1 \cdot 2^{4} = 16\)
- \(0 \cdot 2^{3} = 0\)
- \(0 \cdot 2^{2} = 0\)
- \(0 \cdot 2^{1} = 0\)
- \(0 \cdot 2^{0} = 0\)
"Now, summing these values:"
\[
N = 4096 + 2048 + 0 + 512 + 256 + 0 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0
\]
Calculating the total:
\[
N = 4096 + 2048 = 6144  
6144 + 512 = 6656  
6656 + 256 = 6912  
6912 + 64 = 6976  
6976 + 32 = 7008  
7008 + 16 = 7024  
7024 + 8 = 7032
\]
"Thus, the decimal value of \(N\) is \(7032\)."
### Step 2: Compute \(N \mod 1000\)
"Now, we need to find the remainder when \(N = 7032\) is divided by 1000:"
\[
7032 \mod 1000 = 32
\]
### Final Answer
"Thus, the correct remainder when \(N\) is divided by 1000 is:"
\[
\boxed{32}
\]

"Thus, the final answer is: 32$"
