Question: Let $S$ be the increasing sequence of positive integers whose binary representation has exactly $8$ ones. Let $N$ be the 1000th number in $S$. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.
3o-mini: We are given that S is the increasing sequence of all positive integers whose binary expansion contains exactly 8 ones. Let N be the 1000th number in S. We wish to compute N mod 1000.
Step 1. Count by bit‐length.
Any positive integer with m binary digits (i.e. with a 1 in the m‑1st position) and exactly 8 ones must have its most significant bit equal to 1 and exactly 7 ones among the remaining m – 1 bits. Hence for a fixed length m the number of such numbers is
"  C(m – 1, 7)."
"Numbers with fewer than 8 ones are impossible, so the minimum number of digits is 8 (which gives 11111111₂)."
"Now, count for increasing m until the cumulative count exceeds 1000:"
"• m = 8: Count = C(7, 7) = 1  "
"• m = 9: Count = C(8, 7) = 8      Cumulative = 1 + 8 = 9  "
"• m = 10: Count = C(9, 7) = 36      Cumulative = 9 + 36 = 45  "
"• m = 11: Count = C(10, 7) = 120     Cumulative = 45 + 120 = 165  "
"• m = 12: Count = C(11, 7) = 330     Cumulative = 165 + 330 = 495  "
"• m = 13: Count = C(12, 7) = 792     Cumulative = 495 + 792 = 1287  "
"Since 495 < 1000 ≤ 1287, the 1000th number appears among the 13‑digit numbers."
"Among the 13‑digit numbers, the 1000th number overall is the (1000 – 495) = 505th smallest 13‑digit number having exactly 8 ones."
Step 2. Locate the 505th 13‑digit number with 8 ones.
"A 13‑digit number in binary has its most significant bit (at position 12, if we label positions 12 down to 0) equal to 1. The remaining 12 positions (positions 11 to 0) must then contain exactly 7 ones (because 1 + 7 = 8). There are C(12, 7) = 792 such numbers, and they are naturally listed in increasing order when we consider the bits from most significant to least (a “0” in a high‐position makes the number smaller)."
"Let k = 505. Our task is to “build” the binary number from bit position 11 down to 0 using a greedy algorithm. At each bit we decide whether to set the bit to 0 or 1. At each step, if there are n positions left (not counting the current decision) and we need to place r ones, then if we set the current bit to 0 the number of ways to fill the remaining bits is C(n, r); if k is more than that number, it means that the target number does not lie among those with the current bit 0, so we must set the bit to 1 and subtract that count from k, and also decrease r by 1."
Recall that initially we have 12 positions (positions 11 to 0) and 7 ones to place.
"Let the bits in positions 11 down to 0 be b11, b10, …, b0."
1. Position 11:
" • If b11 = 0, then ways = C(11, 7) = 330."
" • Since k = 505 > 330, we set b11 = 1."
"  Now, update: k = 505 – 330 = 175 and remaining ones r = 7 – 1 = 6; positions left = 11 (positions 10 to 0)."
2. Position 10:
" • If b10 = 0, ways = C(10, 6) = 210."
" • k = 175 ≤ 210, so we choose b10 = 0."
"  (r remains 6; positions left now 10, positions 9 to 0; k still 175.)"
3. Position 9:
" • If b9 = 0, ways = C(9, 6) = 84."
" • k = 175 > 84, so choose b9 = 1."
  Update: k = 175 – 84 = 91; r becomes 6 – 1 = 5; positions left become 9 (positions 8 to 0).
4. Position 8:
" • If b8 = 0, ways = C(8, 5) = 56."
" • k = 91 > 56, so choose b8 = 1."
  Update: k = 91 – 56 = 35; r becomes 5 – 1 = 4; positions left become 8 (positions 7 to 0).
5. Position 7:
" • If b7 = 0, ways = C(7, 4) = 35."
" • k = 35 ≤ 35, so choose b7 = 0."
  (r remains 4; positions left = 7 (positions 6 to 0); k remains 35.)
6. Position 6:
" • If b6 = 0, ways = C(6, 4) = 15."
" • k = 35 > 15, so choose b6 = 1."
  Update: k = 35 – 15 = 20; r becomes 4 – 1 = 3; positions left = 6 (positions 5 to 0).
7. Position 5:
" • If b5 = 0, ways = C(5, 3) = 10."
" • k = 20 > 10, so choose b5 = 1."
  Update: k = 20 – 10 = 10; r becomes 3 – 1 = 2; positions left = 5 (positions 4 to 0).
8. Position 4:
" • If b4 = 0, ways = C(4, 2) = 6."
" • k = 10 > 6, so choose b4 = 1."
  Update: k = 10 – 6 = 4; r becomes 2 – 1 = 1; positions left = 4 (positions 3 to 0).
9. Position 3:
" • If b3 = 0, ways = C(3, 1) = 3."
" • k = 4 > 3, so choose b3 = 1."
"  Update: k = 4 – 3 = 1; r becomes 1 – 1 = 0; positions left = 3 (positions 2, 1, 0)."
"10. With r = 0, the remaining bits must all be 0:"
"  Set b2 = 0, b1 = 0, b0 = 0."
"Now, recall that the 13‑digit binary number has its fixed most significant bit b12 = 1. Putting all positions together (from bit 12 down to 0):"
 b12 b11 b10 b9 b8 b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1 b0  
  1  1  0  1  1  0  1  1  1  1  0  0  0
Step 3. Compute the Integer N and the Remainder Mod 1000.
Now convert the binary number to decimal. The positions (with their corresponding powers of 2) that are 1 are:
 • b12 = 2^12 = 4096
 • b11 = 2^11 = 2048
 • b9  = 2^9  = 512
 • b8  = 2^8  = 256
 • b6  = 2^6  = 64
 • b5  = 2^5  = 32
 • b4  = 2^4  = 16
 • b3  = 2^3  = 8
Add them:
 4096 + 2048 = 6144  
 6144 + 512 = 6656  
 6656 + 256 = 6912  
 6912 + 64 = 6976  
 6976 + 32 = 7008  
 7008 + 16 = 7024  
 7024 + 8 = 7032
"Thus, N = 7032. Finally, we compute 7032 mod 1000. Since 7032 = 7000 + 32, the remainder is 32."
Answer: 32.
