"Question: What is the average of all positive integers that have three digits when written in base $5$, but two digits when written in base $8$? Write your answer in base $10$."
"3o-mini: To have three digits in base 5, a number must be at least 100₅ and at most 444₅. Converting these to base 10 gives:"
  100₅ = 1×5² + 0×5 + 0 = 25  
  444₅ = 4×5² + 4×5 + 4 = 100 + 20 + 4 = 124
So the number must be between 25 and 124 in base 10.
"To have two digits in base 8, a number must be at least 10₈ and at most 77₈. Converting these:"
  10₈ = 1×8 + 0 = 8  
  77₈ = 7×8 + 7 = 56 + 7 = 63
"Thus, the number must be between 8 and 63 in base 10."
"Taking the intersection of the two ranges, we need numbers between 25 and 63 (inclusive)."
"Since this is a series of consecutive integers from 25 to 63, the average is the mean of the smallest and largest values:"
  Average = (25 + 63) / 2 = 88 / 2 = 44
"So, the average of all positive integers that satisfy the conditions is 44 in base 10."
