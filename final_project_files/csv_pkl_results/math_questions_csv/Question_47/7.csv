"Question: What is the average of all positive integers that have three digits when written in base $5$, but two digits when written in base $8$? Write your answer in base $10$."
"3o-mini: To solve the problem, we first determine the conditions for the number n:"
1. Three digits in base 5:
" • The smallest three-digit number in base 5 is 100₅, which equals 1·25 + 0·5 + 0 = 25 in base 10."
" • The largest three-digit number in base 5 is 444₅, which equals 4·25 + 4·5 + 4 = 100 + 20 + 4 = 124 in base 10."
" So, n must satisfy: 25 ≤ n ≤ 124."
2. Two digits in base 8:
" • The smallest two-digit number in base 8 is 10₈, which equals 8 in base 10."
" • The largest two-digit number in base 8 is 77₈, which equals 7·8 + 7 = 56 + 7 = 63 in base 10."
" So, n must satisfy: 8 ≤ n ≤ 63."
"Now, n must satisfy both conditions. The overlapping range is:"
 25 ≤ n ≤ 63.
The average of all integers from 25 to 63 is calculated as:
 Average = (first term + last term) / 2 = (25 + 63) / 2 = 88 / 2 = 44.
"Thus, the average of all such numbers is 44 (in base 10)."
