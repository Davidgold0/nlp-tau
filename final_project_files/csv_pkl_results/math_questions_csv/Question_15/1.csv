Question: Find all values of $k$ so that the domain of_x000D_
\[b(x) = \frac{kx^2 + 2x - 5}{-5x^2 + 2x + k}\]is the set of all real numbers.
Teacher: Let's begin by understanding the problem. We need the function
  b(x) = (kx² + 2x – 5) / (–5x² + 2x + k)
"to be defined for every real number x. For that to happen, the denominator must never be zero for any real x. "
Here’s a plan for how to tackle the problem:
1. Identify the quadratic in the denominator: –5x² + 2x + k.  
2. Recall that a quadratic has no real roots when its discriminant (b² – 4ac) is less than 0.  
3. Write down the discriminant for this quadratic in terms of k.  
4. Set up and solve the inequality that ensures the discriminant is negative.  
"Let's start with the first step: Please write down the expression for the denominator polynomial, identify the coefficients a, b, and c, and then set up the expression for the discriminant. What are your values for a, b, c, and what is the discriminant expression?"
Student: Sure! The denominator of the function \( b(x) \) is 
\[
-5x^2 + 2x + k.
\]
"Now, we can identify the coefficients for the quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c \):"
- \( a = -5 \)
- \( b = 2 \)
- \( c = k \)
"Next, we can set up the expression for the discriminant \( D \) of a quadratic, which is given by:"
\[
D = b^2 - 4ac.
\]
"Substituting in our values for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):"
\[
D = (2)^2 - 4(-5)(k) = 4 + 20k.
\]
"So, the discriminant expression is "
\[
D = 4 + 20k.
\]
What should we do next?
"Teacher: Great work identifying the coefficients and writing down the discriminant as D = 4 + 20k. The next step is to ensure that the denominator never equals zero for any real x. For the quadratic in the denominator to have no real roots, its discriminant must be less than 0."
"So, we set up the inequality:"
  4 + 20k < 0
"Now, please solve this inequality for k. What value (or range of values) of k do you obtain from this inequality?"
Student: Sure! Let's solve the inequality \( 4 + 20k < 0 \).
"First, we can isolate \( k \):"
1. Subtract 4 from both sides:
   \[
   20k < -4
   \]
"2. Next, divide both sides by 20:"
   \[
   k < -\frac{4}{20}
   \]
3. Simplifying \(-\frac{4}{20}\) gives:
   \[
   k < -\frac{1}{5}
   \]
"So, the solution to the inequality is:"
\[
k < -\frac{1}{5}.
\]
"This means that for the function \( b(x) \) to be defined for all real numbers, \( k \) must be less than \(-\frac{1}{5}\). "
"Is this the correct direction, or do you have any further guidance?"
"Teacher: You've done a great job setting up and solving the inequality 4 + 20k < 0, arriving at k < -1/5. "
"Now, before we conclude, let’s take one more step to double-check our reasoning: Can you explain why we don’t need to consider any other restrictions (such as conditions from the numerator) to ensure that the domain of b(x) is all real numbers? Please explain your thinking."
Student: Student: Absolutely! The reason we only need to focus on the denominator for determining the domain of the function \( b(x) \) is that the function is defined as long as the denominator is not equal to zero. 
"In this case, the numerator \( kx^2 + 2x - 5 \) can take any real value since it is a polynomial, which is defined for all real \( x \). Therefore, it doesn't impose any restrictions on the domain."
"However, the denominator \( -5x^2 + 2x + k \) must not equal zero for any real \( x \) in order for \( b(x) \) to be defined for all real numbers. As we established earlier, to ensure that the denominator never equals zero, its discriminant must be negative, which we solved to find that \( k < -\frac{1}{5} \)."
"In summary, the only restriction on \( k \) comes from the requirement that the denominator does not have real roots, leading us to the conclusion that \( k < -\frac{1}{5} \) is sufficient for the function \( b(x) \) to be defined for all real numbers. "
Does that clarify the reasoning?
"Teacher: Excellent explanation! You've correctly reasoned that the numerator being a polynomial doesn't restrict the domain, so our only concern is ensuring the denominator never equals zero. Since having no real roots in the denominator requires the discriminant to be negative, our solution k < -1/5 guarantees that condition. "
You've successfully completed all the steps. The final answer is:
k < -1/5$
