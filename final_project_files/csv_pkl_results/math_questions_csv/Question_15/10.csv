Question: Find all values of $k$ so that the domain of_x000D_
\[b(x) = \frac{kx^2 + 2x - 5}{-5x^2 + 2x + k}\]is the set of all real numbers.
"3o-mini: To ensure the domain of b(x) is all real numbers, we must guarantee that the denominator"
  –5x² + 2x + k
never equals zero for any real value of x.
"A quadratic expression ax² + bx + c is never zero if its discriminant, D = b² – 4ac, is negative."
"For the denominator, we have:"
"  a = –5, b = 2, c = k."
Calculate the discriminant:
  D = 2² – 4(–5)(k) = 4 + 20k.
"For the quadratic to have no real roots, we require:"
  4 + 20k < 0.
Solve for k:
  20k < -4 ⟹ k < -4/20 ⟹ k < -1/5.
"Thus, the domain of b(x) will be all real numbers if and only if k < -1/5."
