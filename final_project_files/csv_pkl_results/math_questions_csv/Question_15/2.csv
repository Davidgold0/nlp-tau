Question: Find all values of $k$ so that the domain of_x000D_
\[b(x) = \frac{kx^2 + 2x - 5}{-5x^2 + 2x + k}\]is the set of all real numbers.
Teacher: Let's begin by breaking down the problem. We want the domain of
  b(x) = (kx² + 2x – 5)⁄(–5x² + 2x + k)
"to be all real numbers. This will happen if the denominator is never 0 for any real x. Since the denominator is a quadratic in x, we need to ensure it has no real roots."
A quadratic ax² + bx + c has no real roots when its discriminant (b² – 4ac) is less than 0.
"Step 1: Apply this idea to the denominator, –5x² + 2x + k. "
Please calculate the discriminant of this quadratic (in terms of k). What expression do you obtain for the discriminant?
"Student: To find the discriminant of the quadratic \(-5x^2 + 2x + k\), we can use the formula for the discriminant, which is given by:"
\[
D = b^2 - 4ac
\]
"In our case, the coefficients are:"
- \(a = -5\)
- \(b = 2\)
- \(c = k\)
"Now, substituting these values into the discriminant formula:"
\[
D = (2)^2 - 4(-5)(k)
\]
Calculating this step by step:
1. Calculate \(b^2\):
   \[
   (2)^2 = 4
   \]
2. Calculate \(-4ac\):
   \[
   -4(-5)(k) = 20k
   \]
"Now, putting it all together:"
\[
D = 4 + 20k
\]
"So, the expression for the discriminant in terms of \(k\) is:"
\[
D = 4 + 20k
\] 
Is this correct?
Teacher: That's correct! You computed the discriminant correctly as 4 + 20k. 
"Now, let's move on to the next step. To ensure the denominator never equals zero, the quadratic must have no real roots. This means the discriminant must be less than 0. "
Step 2: Write and solve the inequality 4 + 20k < 0. 
What values of k do you obtain from solving this inequality?
"Student: To solve the inequality \(4 + 20k < 0\), we will isolate \(k\)."
1. Start by subtracting 4 from both sides:
   \[
   20k < -4
   \]
"2. Next, divide both sides by 20:"
   \[
   k < -\frac{4}{20}
   \]
3. Simplifying \(-\frac{4}{20}\) gives:
   \[
   k < -\frac{1}{5}
   \]
"Thus, the values of \(k\) that satisfy the inequality are:"
\[
k < -\frac{1}{5}
\]
"This means that for the function \(b(x)\) to have a domain of all real numbers, \(k\) must be less than \(-\frac{1}{5}\)."
Teacher: Great job solving the inequality! You've correctly obtained k < -1/5 for the denominator's discriminant to be negative. 
"Before we move on, let's reflect on this step together. Can you explain why it's important that the inequality is strict (i.e., using ""<"" instead of ""≤"")? What would happen if k were exactly –1/5? Please share your thoughts on that."
"Student: Student: Thank you for the guidance! It's important that the inequality is strict (using ""<"" instead of ""≤"") because we want to ensure that the quadratic in the denominator, \(-5x^2 + 2x + k\), has no real roots at all. "
"If \(k\) were exactly \(-\frac{1}{5}\), the discriminant would be zero:"
\[
D = 4 + 20\left(-\frac{1}{5}\right) = 4 - 4 = 0
\]
"When the discriminant is zero, it means that the quadratic has exactly one real root. In this case, the denominator would equal zero at that specific real root, which would make the function \(b(x)\) undefined at that point. Therefore, the domain would not be all real numbers, as there would be a value of \(x\) that we couldn't use."
"By requiring \(k < -\frac{1}{5}\), we ensure that the quadratic has no real roots, and thus the function \(b(x)\) is defined for all real \(x\). This is why the strict inequality is necessary."
Teacher: Great explanation! You've clearly shown why we require the strict inequality to avoid any real roots in the denominator and how k must be less than –1/5 for the function to be defined for all real numbers.
"Now, before we wrap up, could you please summarize the entire reasoning process in your own words and then state the final answer for k? Remember to include only your conclusion for k at the very end."
Student: Sure! 
To determine the values of \(k\) for which the function 
\[
b(x) = \frac{kx^2 + 2x - 5}{-5x^2 + 2x + k}
\]
"has a domain of all real numbers, we need to ensure that the denominator, \(-5x^2 + 2x + k\), never equals zero for any real \(x\). This can be achieved by ensuring that the quadratic in the denominator has no real roots, which occurs when its discriminant is less than zero."
"We calculated the discriminant \(D\) of the quadratic \(-5x^2 + 2x + k\) using the formula \(D = b^2 - 4ac\). Substituting in the appropriate values, we found:"
\[
D = 4 + 20k.
\]
"Next, we set up the inequality \(4 + 20k < 0\) to ensure the discriminant is negative. Solving this inequality, we isolated \(k\) and found:"
1. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives \(20k < -4\).
2. Dividing by 20 results in \(k < -\frac{1}{5}\).
This means that \(k\) must be less than \(-\frac{1}{5}\) for the quadratic to have no real roots. 
"It's important to note that we require a strict inequality because if \(k\) were exactly \(-\frac{1}{5}\), the discriminant would equal zero, indicating that the quadratic would have one real root, thus making the function undefined at that point."
"In conclusion, the values of \(k\) that allow the function \(b(x)\) to have a domain of all real numbers are:"
\[
k < -\frac{1}{5}.
\]
"Teacher: Great job summarizing the entire process! You've clearly explained that to make sure the denominator – namely, the quadratic – has no real roots (and therefore never equals zero), we require its discriminant to be negative. Calculating the discriminant, we obtained 4 + 20k, and setting up 4 + 20k < 0 led us to the inequality k < -1/5. This strict inequality is needed because if k were exactly -1/5, the discriminant would be zero, yielding one real root and exposing a point where the function is undefined."
"Based on our reasoning, the final answer for k is:"
k < -1/5$
