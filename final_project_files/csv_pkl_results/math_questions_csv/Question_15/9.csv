Question: Find all values of $k$ so that the domain of_x000D_
\[b(x) = \frac{kx^2 + 2x - 5}{-5x^2 + 2x + k}\]is the set of all real numbers.
3o-mini: We are given the function
  b(x) = (kx² + 2x − 5) / (−5x² + 2x + k).
"To ensure that the domain is all real numbers, the denominator must never be zero for any real x. That is, the quadratic"
  d(x) = −5x² + 2x + k
must have no real roots.
A quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 has no real roots if its discriminant (b² − 4ac) is negative.
"For d(x), we have:"
"  a = −5,"
"  b = 2,"
  c = k.
Calculate the discriminant D:
  D = b² − 4ac = 2² − 4(−5)(k) = 4 + 20k.
We need D < 0:
  4 + 20k < 0
  20k < −4
  k < −4/20
  k < −1/5.
"Thus, for all values k < −1/5, the quadratic denominator has no real roots, and the domain of b(x) is all real numbers."
So the final answer is: all k such that k < −1/5.
