Question: Find all values of $k$ so that the domain of_x000D_
\[b(x) = \frac{kx^2 + 2x - 5}{-5x^2 + 2x + k}\]is the set of all real numbers.
3o-mini: The domain of a rational function is all real numbers x for which the denominator is not zero. For the function
"  b(x) = (kx² + 2x − 5) / (−5x² + 2x + k),"
we need the denominator −5x² + 2x + k to be nonzero for every real x.
"Since −5x² + 2x + k is a quadratic in x, it will be nonzero for all x if and only if it has no real roots. To ensure that a quadratic has no real roots, its discriminant must be less than zero."
Step 1. Write the quadratic:
  −5x² + 2x + k = 0.
"Step 2. Compute the discriminant. For a quadratic ax² + bx + c, the discriminant is b² − 4ac. Here:"
"  a = −5, b = 2, c = k."
"So, the discriminant is:"
  D = 2² − 4(−5)(k) = 4 + 20k.
Step 3. Set the discriminant less than zero:
  4 + 20k < 0.
Step 4. Solve for k:
  20k < −4  
  k < −4/20  
  k < −1/5.
"Thus, for all k < −1/5, the quadratic in the denominator has no real roots. This means the denominator is never zero, and b(x) is defined for all real x."
Answer: The domain of b(x) is all real numbers if and only if k < −1/5.
