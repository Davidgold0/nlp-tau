Question: Find all values of $k$ so that the domain of_x000D_
\[b(x) = \frac{kx^2 + 2x - 5}{-5x^2 + 2x + k}\]is the set of all real numbers.
3o-mini: We start with the function
  b(x) = (kx² + 2x - 5) / (–5x² + 2x + k).
"The domain of b(x) is all real numbers if and only if the denominator is never zero for any real x. In other words, the quadratic equation"
  –5x² + 2x + k = 0
must have no real solutions.
A quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 has no real solutions when its discriminant D = b² – 4ac is negative.
"For our denominator, a = –5, b = 2, and c = k. So the discriminant is"
  D = (2)² – 4(–5)(k) = 4 + 20k.
We need
  4 + 20k < 0.
Solving this inequality:
  20k < –4  
  k < –4/20  
  k < –1/5.
"Thus, for any value of k less than –1/5, the denominator –5x² + 2x + k will never equal zero, and the function b(x) will be defined for all real numbers."
"Therefore, the answer is all k such that k < –1/5."
