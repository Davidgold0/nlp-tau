Question: Find all values of $k$ so that the domain of_x000D_
\[b(x) = \frac{kx^2 + 2x - 5}{-5x^2 + 2x + k}\]is the set of all real numbers.
Teacher: Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given a function
  b(x) = (kx² + 2x – 5) / (–5x² + 2x + k).
"For the domain of b(x) to be all real numbers, the denominator must never be zero for any real x. "
"Step 1: Write down the condition that ensures the quadratic expression in the denominator has no real roots (i.e., it never equals zero). Can you explain what condition on a quadratic’s discriminant will guarantee that it has no real roots, and then apply that condition to the denominator –5x² + 2x + k? Please show your reasoning for this step."
"Student: To ensure that the quadratic expression in the denominator, \(-5x^2 + 2x + k\), has no real roots, we need to look at the discriminant of the quadratic. "
"The general form of a quadratic equation is given by \(ax^2 + bx + c\), where the discriminant \(D\) is calculated as:"
\[
D = b^2 - 4ac
\]
"For the quadratic to have no real roots, the discriminant must be less than zero:"
\[
D < 0
\]
"In our case, the coefficients are:"
- \(a = -5\)
- \(b = 2\)
- \(c = k\)
"Now, let's calculate the discriminant for our specific quadratic:"
\[
D = (2)^2 - 4(-5)(k) = 4 + 20k
\]
"To ensure that the denominator has no real roots, we need:"
\[
4 + 20k < 0
\]
"Now, we can solve this inequality for \(k\):"
1. Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
20k < -4
\]
2. Divide both sides by 20:
\[
k < -\frac{4}{20} = -\frac{1}{5}
\]
"So, the condition for \(k\) is:"
\[
k < -\frac{1}{5}
\]
"This means that for the function \(b(x)\) to have a domain of all real numbers, \(k\) must be less than \(-\frac{1}{5}\). "
"Does this reasoning align with what you were thinking, or would you like me to clarify any part of it?"
"Teacher: Great work! You've correctly set up the inequality using the discriminant and solved for k by ensuring that 4 + 20k is less than 0, arriving at k < –1/5."
"Now, before we conclude this step, let’s consider one more thing: sometimes in rational functions, the numerator and denominator might have a common factor that could cancel out. However, even if a common factor exists, the original function’s domain is determined by the values for which the denominator itself is zero."
Step 2: Please explain whether or not a cancellation due to a common factor between the numerator and the denominator would affect the domain of the original function. Can you describe your reasoning on this point?
"Student: Student: Thank you for the guidance! To address your question about whether a cancellation due to a common factor between the numerator and denominator would affect the domain of the original function, we need to consider how rational functions work."
"In a rational function like \( b(x) = \frac{kx^2 + 2x - 5}{-5x^2 + 2x + k} \), the domain is determined by the values of \( x \) for which the denominator is not zero. If there is a common factor between the numerator and denominator, it means that there are specific values of \( x \) that would make both the numerator and denominator equal to zero. "
"If we were to cancel this common factor, those specific values of \( x \) would no longer appear in the simplified version of the function, but they would still be points where the original function is undefined. Therefore, even if we simplify the function by canceling a common factor, we must still exclude those points from the domain."
"In summary, cancellation does not change the fact that the original function is undefined at those points where the denominator is zero. So, the domain of the original function is still determined by the values that make the denominator zero, regardless of any common factors that may exist."
Does this explanation align with your expectations? Would you like me to elaborate further?
"Teacher: Great explanation on the cancellation! You correctly pointed out that even if there is a common factor between the numerator and the denominator, the original function’s domain is still determined by the values of x that make the denominator zero."
"Now, for the final step, please combine your insights. Considering that for the denominator –5x² + 2x + k to have no real roots we needed 4 + 20k < 0, which led to k < –1/5, and noting that any common factor cancellation does not remove the need to exclude the zeros of the original denominator, what is the final condition on k so that the domain of b(x) is all real numbers? Please state your final answer and explain briefly how both steps contribute to your result."
Student: To summarize our findings:
"1. We established that for the function \( b(x) = \frac{kx^2 + 2x - 5}{-5x^2 + 2x + k} \) to have a domain of all real numbers, the denominator \(-5x^2 + 2x + k\) must not have any real roots. This is determined by ensuring that the discriminant \( D \) of the quadratic is less than zero."
2. We calculated the discriminant:
   \[
   D = 4 + 20k
   \]
   and set up the inequality:
   \[
   4 + 20k < 0
   \]
   Solving this led us to the condition:
   \[
   k < -\frac{1}{5}
   \]
"3. Additionally, we discussed that even if there were common factors between the numerator and denominator, the original function’s domain would still be affected by the zeros of the denominator. This means that we must ensure the denominator does not equal zero for any real \( x \)."
"Combining these insights, the final condition that ensures the domain of \( b(x) \) is all real numbers is:"
\[
k < -\frac{1}{5}
\]
"This condition guarantees that the quadratic in the denominator has no real roots, thus ensuring that \( b(x) \) is defined for all real values of \( x \). Therefore, the final answer is:"
**The values of \( k \) such that the domain of \( b(x) \) is all real numbers are \( k < -\frac{1}{5} \).** 
Does this final answer and explanation meet your expectations?
"Teacher: Excellent work! Your reasoning is spot on. You correctly recognized that the denominator must not have any real roots, leading you to using the discriminant 4 + 20k < 0, which simplifies to k < -1/5, and you also correctly noted that any cancellation of common factors does not affect the domain determined by the original denominator. "
"Thus, your final answer is:"
k < -1/5$
