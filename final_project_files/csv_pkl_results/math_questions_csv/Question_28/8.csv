Question: Find the minimum value of_x000D_
\[\frac{\left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^6 - \left( x^6 + \dfrac{1}{x^6} \right) - 2}{\left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^3 + \left( x^3 + \dfrac{1}{x^3} \right)}\]for $x > 0.$
3o-mini: We start with the expression
"  E = [ (x + 1/x)⁶ – (x⁶ + 1/x⁶) – 2 ] / [ (x + 1/x)³ + (x³ + 1/x³) ],"
for x > 0.
Step 1. Let u = x + 1/x. Then note the identities
  x³ + 1/x³ = u³ – 3u
and
  x⁶ + 1/x⁶ = (x³ + 1/x³)² – 2 = (u³ – 3u)² – 2.
Step 2. Express the numerator in terms of u:
  Numerator = u⁶ – [(u³ – 3u)² – 2] – 2
         = u⁶ – (u⁶ – 6u⁴ + 9u² – 2) – 2
         = u⁶ – u⁶ + 6u⁴ – 9u² + 2 – 2
         = 6u⁴ – 9u².
Step 3. Express the denominator in terms of u:
  Denom = u³ + (u³ – 3u) = 2u³ – 3u.
Step 4. Simplify the whole expression:
  E = (6u⁴ – 9u²) / (2u³ – 3u).
Factor u and common factors from numerator and denominator:
  Numerator = 3u² (2u² – 3)
  Denom = u (2u² – 3).
"Since u = x + 1/x is at least 2 for x > 0 (by the AM–GM inequality), the factor (2u² – 3) is nonzero. Therefore, we can cancel it to obtain:"
  E = [3u²] / u = 3u.
"Thus, the expression reduces to"
  E = 3(x + 1/x).
Step 5. Minimize 3(x + 1/x) for x > 0:
"By the AM–GM inequality, we have"
"  x + 1/x ≥ 2,"
with equality when x = 1.
"Thus,"
"  E ≥ 3·2 = 6,"
and the minimum value is achieved when x = 1.
Answer: The minimum value of the given expression is 6.
