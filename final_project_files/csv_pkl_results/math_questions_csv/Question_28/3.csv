Question: Find the minimum value of_x000D_
\[\frac{\left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^6 - \left( x^6 + \dfrac{1}{x^6} \right) - 2}{\left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^3 + \left( x^3 + \dfrac{1}{x^3} \right)}\]for $x > 0.$
Teacher: Let's begin by understanding and rephrasing the problem in our own words. We need to find the minimum value (for x > 0) of this expression:
  [ (x + 1/x)^6 – (x^6 + 1/x^6) – 2 ]  divided by  [ (x + 1/x)^3 + (x^3 + 1/x^3) ].
A useful strategy here is to introduce a substitution to simplify the expression. One common choice is to let u = x + 1/x. This substitution can help us rewrite the parts involving powers of x in terms of u.
Here’s an outline of the steps we might follow:
1. Substitute u = x + 1/x.
2. Express x^3 + 1/x^3 in terms of u. (Hint: Try to find a relation between u^3 and x^3 + 1/x^3.)
"3. Similarly, express x^6 + 1/x^6 using the result from step 2."
4. Rewrite both the numerator and denominator in terms of u.
5. Simplify the resulting expression and determine the minimum value for allowed values of u (keeping in mind x > 0 gives a restriction on u).
Let’s take it one step at a time.
"For the first step, please express x^3 + 1/x^3 in terms of u = x + 1/x. What relation do you get?"
"Student: To express \( x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} \) in terms of \( u = x + \frac{1}{x} \), we can use the identity:"
\[
x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} = \left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right)^3 - 3\left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right)
\]
"Substituting \( u \) into this identity, we have:"
\[
x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} = u^3 - 3u
\]
"So, \( x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} \) can be expressed as \( u^3 - 3u \). "
Is this correct? What should we do next?
Teacher: That's exactly right! You correctly showed that
  x³ + 1/x³ = u³ – 3u.
Well done.
"Now for the next step, we need to express x⁶ + 1/x⁶ in terms of u. A helpful idea is to use the relation you just derived. Notice that"
  (x³ + 1/x³)² = x⁶ + 1/x⁶ + 2.
"Given that x³ + 1/x³ = u³ – 3u, can you square this and then solve for x⁶ + 1/x⁶? Please work through that calculation."
Student: Sure! Let's start by squaring the expression for \( x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} \):
\[
(x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3})^2 = (u^3 - 3u)^2
\]
"Expanding the right side, we get:"
\[
(u^3 - 3u)^2 = u^6 - 6u^4 + 9u^2
\]
"Now, we know from the identity that:"
\[
(x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3})^2 = x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6} + 2
\]
Setting these two expressions equal gives us:
\[
x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6} + 2 = u^6 - 6u^4 + 9u^2
\]
"To isolate \( x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6} \), we subtract 2 from both sides:"
\[
x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6} = u^6 - 6u^4 + 9u^2 - 2
\]
Now we have expressed \( x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6} \) in terms of \( u \). 
What should we do next?
Teacher: Great job on expressing x³ + 1/x³ and x⁶ + 1/x⁶ in terms of u!
Let's now proceed to the next step. Recall that our original expression is
  [ (x + 1/x)⁶ – (x⁶ + 1/x⁶) – 2 ]  divided by  [ (x + 1/x)³ + (x³ + 1/x³) ].
"Using u = x + 1/x, we already have:"
"  (x + 1/x)⁶ = u⁶,"
"  x⁶ + 1/x⁶ = u⁶ – 6u⁴ + 9u² – 2, and"
  x³ + 1/x³ = u³ – 3u.
Your task now is to rewrite both the numerator and the denominator completely in terms of u. 
Take the numerator first. Substitute your expressions for (x + 1/x)⁶ and for x⁶ + 1/x⁶ into the numerator:
  Numerator = u⁶ – [u⁶ – 6u⁴ + 9u² – 2] – 2.
Go ahead and simplify this expression. What do you get for the numerator in terms of u?
"Student: To simplify the numerator, we start with the expression:"
\[
\text{Numerator} = u^6 - \left( u^6 - 6u^4 + 9u^2 - 2 \right) - 2.
\]
"Distributing the negative sign inside the brackets, we have:"
\[
\text{Numerator} = u^6 - u^6 + 6u^4 - 9u^2 + 2 - 2.
\]
"The \( u^6 \) terms cancel out, and the \( +2 \) and \( -2 \) also cancel, leaving us with:"
\[
\text{Numerator} = 6u^4 - 9u^2.
\]
Now we have the numerator expressed in terms of \( u \):
\[
\text{Numerator} = 6u^4 - 9u^2.
\]
"Next, let's move on to the denominator. We need to substitute our expression for \( x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} \) into the denominator:"
\[
\text{Denominator} = u^3 + (u^3 - 3u).
\]
Combining the terms gives us:
\[
\text{Denominator} = u^3 + u^3 - 3u = 2u^3 - 3u.
\]
Now we have both the numerator and the denominator in terms of \( u \):
- Numerator: \( 6u^4 - 9u^2 \)
- Denominator: \( 2u^3 - 3u \)
What should we do next with these expressions?
"Teacher: Excellent work simplifying the numerator and denominator in terms of u. Now, the next step is to simplify the entire expression by canceling any common factors."
We have:
  Numerator = 6u⁴ – 9u²
  Denominator = 2u³ – 3u
Can you factor both the numerator and the denominator and then simplify the fraction? Please show your work for this next step.
Student: Sure! Let's start by factoring both the numerator and the denominator.
**Numerator:**
We have:
\[
6u^4 - 9u^2.
\]
We can factor out \( 3u^2 \):
\[
3u^2(2u^2 - 3).
\]
**Denominator:**
Now for the denominator:
\[
2u^3 - 3u.
\]
We can factor out \( u \):
\[
u(2u^2 - 3).
\]
Now we can rewrite the entire expression:
\[
\frac{6u^4 - 9u^2}{2u^3 - 3u} = \frac{3u^2(2u^2 - 3)}{u(2u^2 - 3)}.
\]
"Assuming \( 2u^2 - 3 \neq 0 \) (which we will check later), we can cancel \( 2u^2 - 3 \) from the numerator and denominator:"
\[
\frac{3u^2}{u} = 3u.
\]
"So, the simplified expression is:"
\[
3u.
\]
"Next, we need to find the minimum value of \( 3u \) for \( u = x + \frac{1}{x} \) with \( x > 0 \). "
"We know that \( u \) reaches its minimum value when \( x = 1 \), giving us:"
\[
u = 1 + 1 = 2.
\]
"Thus, the minimum value of \( 3u \) is:"
\[
3 \times 2 = 6.
\]
"Finally, we should confirm that \( 2u^2 - 3 = 0 \) does not affect the minimum value. Setting \( 2u^2 - 3 = 0 \) gives:"
\[
u^2 = \frac{3}{2} \implies u = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \text{ or } u = -\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}.
\]
"Since \( u = x + \frac{1}{x} \) is always greater than or equal to 2 for \( x > 0 \), \( 2u^2 - 3 = 0 \) does not occur for our valid range of \( u \)."
"Therefore, the minimum value of the original expression is:"
\[
\boxed{6}.
\]
Teacher: Excellent work! You clearly and correctly simplified the expression step by step. To summarize what we did:
1. We set u = x + 1/x.
2. We expressed x³ + 1/x³ as u³ – 3u.
3. We then squared that to find x⁶ + 1/x⁶ = u⁶ – 6u⁴ + 9u² – 2.
"4. Substituting these into the original expression turned the numerator into u⁶ – (u⁶ – 6u⁴ + 9u² – 2) – 2, which simplified to 6u⁴ – 9u², and the denominator into u³ + (u³ – 3u) = 2u³ – 3u."
"5. Factoring gave us 3u²(2u² – 3) in the numerator and u(2u² – 3) in the denominator, allowing cancellation to yield 3u."
"6. Since u = x + 1/x is minimized for x > 0 when x = 1 (i.e. u = 2), the minimum value of the expression is 3×2 = 6."
Your reasoning and calculations throughout were spot-on.
