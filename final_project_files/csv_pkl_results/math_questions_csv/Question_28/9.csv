Question: Find the minimum value of_x000D_
\[\frac{\left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^6 - \left( x^6 + \dfrac{1}{x^6} \right) - 2}{\left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^3 + \left( x^3 + \dfrac{1}{x^3} \right)}\]for $x > 0.$
3o-mini: Let
  y = x + 1/x.
"Notice that by a well-known identity, we have"
  x³ + 1/x³ = y³ – 3y
and
  x⁶ + 1/x⁶ = (x³ + 1/x³)² – 2 = (y³ – 3y)² – 2 = y⁶ – 6y⁴ + 9y² – 2.
"Now, rewrite the original expression in terms of y:"
  E = { (x + 1/x)⁶ – [x⁶ + 1/x⁶] – 2 } / { (x + 1/x)³ + [x³ + 1/x³] }
   = { y⁶ – [y⁶ – 6y⁴ + 9y² – 2] – 2 } / { y³ + (y³ – 3y) }
   = { y⁶ – y⁶ + 6y⁴ – 9y² + 2 – 2 } / { 2y³ – 3y }
   = (6y⁴ – 9y²) / (2y³ – 3y).
Factor out common terms:
"  Numerator: 6y⁴ – 9y² = 3y²(2y² – 3),"
  Denominator: 2y³ – 3y = y(2y² – 3).
"Thus, for y such that 2y² – 3 ≠ 0 (note that for x > 0, y = x + 1/x ≥ 2 so 2y² – 3 is always positive):"
  E = [3y²(2y² – 3)] / [y(2y² – 3)] = 3y.
"Now, we want the minimum of E = 3y subject to x > 0 (which implies y = x + 1/x)."
By the AM–GM inequality:
"  x + 1/x ≥ 2  (for x > 0),"
"with equality when x = 1. Hence, the smallest possible value of y is 2."
Substituting back:
  Minimum E = 3 × 2 = 6.
"Thus, the minimum value of the given expression for x > 0 is 6."
