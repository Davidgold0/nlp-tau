Question: Find the minimum value of_x000D_
\[\frac{\left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^6 - \left( x^6 + \dfrac{1}{x^6} \right) - 2}{\left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^3 + \left( x^3 + \dfrac{1}{x^3} \right)}\]for $x > 0.$
"Teacher: Let's start by outlining an approach to this problem step by step. Notice that both the numerator and the denominator involve expressions like x + 1/x, x³ + 1/x³, and even x⁶ + 1/x⁶. A good strategy is to express everything in terms of a single substitution. Here’s one way to break down the problem:"
"Step 1: Introduce a substitution. Often, in problems with x and 1/x, letting u = x + 1/x is very helpful. This lets you express both x³ + 1/x³ and x⁶ + 1/x⁶ in terms of u. Can you tell me what x³ + 1/x³ becomes in terms of u?"
Please solve this first step and show your work.
Student: Sure! Let's start by using the substitution \( u = x + \frac{1}{x} \).
"To find \( x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} \) in terms of \( u \), we can use the identity:"
\[
x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} = \left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right)^3 - 3\left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right)
\]
"Now, substituting \( u \) into the equation, we have:"
\[
x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} = u^3 - 3u
\]
"So, \( x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} \) can be expressed as \( u^3 - 3u \)."
"Next, we can also find \( x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6} \) using the identity:"
\[
x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6} = \left( x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} \right)^2 - 2
\]
Substituting \( x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} = u^3 - 3u \) into this identity gives:
\[
x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6} = (u^3 - 3u)^2 - 2
\]
Now we have both expressions in terms of \( u \):
1. \( x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} = u^3 - 3u \)
2. \( x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6} = (u^3 - 3u)^2 - 2 \)
"With these expressions, we can proceed to substitute them into the original problem. What would you like me to do next?"
Teacher: Great work on rewriting x³ + 1/x³ and x⁶ + 1/x⁶ in terms of u! Your work is correct. Now let's move on to the next step.
"Step 2: Substitute these identities into the original expression. That means, replace"
"  x + 1/x with u,"
"  x³ + 1/x³ with u³ – 3u, and"
  x⁶ + 1/x⁶ with (u³ – 3u)² – 2.
"Then, rewrite the given expression"
  [(x + 1/x)^6 – (x⁶ + 1/x⁶) – 2] / [(x + 1/x)^3 + (x³ + 1/x³)]
entirely in terms of u.
"Please, show me how you would substitute these and simplify the numerator and the denominator as much as possible. What do you get for each part?"
Student: Sure! Let's substitute the expressions we found into the original problem step by step.
We start with the expression:
\[
\frac{\left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right)^6 - \left( x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6} \right) - 2}{\left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right)^3 + \left( x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} \right)}
\]
"Now, substituting \( u = x + \frac{1}{x} \), we have:"
1. For the numerator:
   - \( \left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right)^6 = u^6 \)
   - \( x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6} = (u^3 - 3u)^2 - 2 \)
So the numerator becomes:
\[
u^6 - \left( (u^3 - 3u)^2 - 2 \right) - 2
\]
"Now, simplifying this:"
\[
= u^6 - (u^3 - 3u)^2 + 2 - 2
\]
\[
= u^6 - (u^3 - 3u)^2
\]
2. For the denominator:
   - \( \left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right)^3 = u^3 \)
   - \( x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} = u^3 - 3u \)
So the denominator becomes:
\[
u^3 + (u^3 - 3u) = 2u^3 - 3u
\]
"Now, putting both parts together, we have:"
\[
\frac{u^6 - (u^3 - 3u)^2}{2u^3 - 3u}
\]
"Next, we need to simplify the numerator \( u^6 - (u^3 - 3u)^2 \). Let's expand \( (u^3 - 3u)^2 \):"
\[
(u^3 - 3u)^2 = u^6 - 6u^4 + 9u^2
\]
Now substituting this back into the numerator:
\[
u^6 - (u^6 - 6u^4 + 9u^2) = u^6 - u^6 + 6u^4 - 9u^2 = 6u^4 - 9u^2
\]
So now we have:
\[
\frac{6u^4 - 9u^2}{2u^3 - 3u}
\]
We can factor out \( 3u^2 \) from the numerator:
\[
= \frac{3u^2(2u^2 - 3)}{u(2u^2 - 3)}
\]
"As long as \( u \neq 0 \) (which is true since \( x > 0 \)), we can cancel \( (2u^2 - 3) \):"
\[
= 3u^2 \quad \text{for } 2u^2 - 3 \neq 0
\]
Now we have simplified the expression to \( 3u^2 \). 
What would you like me to do next?
Teacher: Great job! Now that you've simplified the expression entirely in terms of u and reached the form
"  3u²,"
the next step is to determine the minimum value of this expression for x > 0.
"Step 3: Recall that u was defined as u = x + 1/x. For x > 0, what is the minimum possible value of u? Please determine the minimal value of u and then use it to find the minimal value of 3u². Explain your reasoning and calculations for this step."
"Student: Sure! To find the minimum value of \( u = x + \frac{1}{x} \) for \( x > 0 \), we can use the AM-GM inequality, which states that the arithmetic mean of non-negative numbers is greater than or equal to the geometric mean."
"In this case, we apply AM-GM to \( x \) and \( \frac{1}{x} \):"
\[
\frac{x + \frac{1}{x}}{2} \geq \sqrt{x \cdot \frac{1}{x}} = 1
\]
Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:
\[
x + \frac{1}{x} \geq 2
\]
"The equality holds when \( x = 1 \). Thus, the minimum value of \( u \) is \( 2 \)."
"Now, we substitute this minimum value back into our expression \( 3u^2 \):"
\[
3u^2 = 3(2^2) = 3 \cdot 4 = 12
\]
"Therefore, the minimum value of the original expression for \( x > 0 \) is \( 12 \)."
"In summary, the minimum value of the expression is:"
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
"Teacher: Your work is excellent! You've correctly applied the AM–GM inequality to deduce that the minimum value of u = x + 1/x for x > 0 is 2, and then you accurately substituted that into 3u² to find the minimal value of the entire expression. "
Everything checks out. 
The final answer is  
12$
