Question: Find the minimum value of_x000D_
\[\frac{\left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^6 - \left( x^6 + \dfrac{1}{x^6} \right) - 2}{\left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^3 + \left( x^3 + \dfrac{1}{x^3} \right)}\]for $x > 0.$
3o-mini: We want to minimize
  [(x + 1/x)^6 – (x^6 + 1/x^6) – 2] / [(x + 1/x)^3 + (x^3 + 1/x^3)]
           for x > 0.
A useful strategy is to set
  t = x + 1/x.
"Note that for x > 0, we have t ≥ 2."
Step 1. Express x^3 + 1/x^3 and x^6 + 1/x^6 in terms of t.
We know:
  x^3 + 1/x^3 = t^3 – 3t.
"Also,"
  x^6 + 1/x^6 = (x^3 + 1/x^3)^2 – 2 = (t^3 – 3t)^2 – 2 = t^6 – 6t^4 + 9t^2 – 2.
Step 2. Rewrite the numerator.
  Numerator = (x + 1/x)^6 – (x^6 + 1/x^6) – 2 = t^6 – [t^6 – 6t^4 + 9t^2 – 2] – 2.
Simplify:
  = t^6 – t^6 + 6t^4 – 9t^2 + 2 – 2 = 6t^4 – 9t^2.
Step 3. Rewrite the denominator.
  Denom = (x + 1/x)^3 + (x^3 + 1/x^3) = t^3 + (t^3 – 3t) = 2t^3 – 3t.
Step 4. Form the expression in terms of t:
  Expression = (6t^4 – 9t^2) / (2t^3 – 3t)
Factor t from both numerator and denominator:
  = [t^2(6t^2 – 9)] / [t(2t^2 – 3)]
  = t(6t^2 – 9) / (2t^2 – 3).
"Notice that 6t^2 – 9 can be factored as 3(2t^2 – 3), so:"
  = t * 3(2t^2 – 3) / (2t^2 – 3)
Cancel the common factor (2t^2 – 3) (which is nonzero since t ≥ 2):
  = 3t.
"Thus, the original expression simplifies to 3(x + 1/x)."
Step 5. Minimize 3(x + 1/x) for x > 0.
"The function x + 1/x has a minimum value of 2 when x = 1 (by the AM-GM inequality). Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is:"
  3 * 2 = 6.
"Thus, the minimum value is 6."
