Question: Find the minimum value of_x000D_
\[\frac{\left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^6 - \left( x^6 + \dfrac{1}{x^6} \right) - 2}{\left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^3 + \left( x^3 + \dfrac{1}{x^3} \right)}\]for $x > 0.$
3o-mini: We start with the expression
  S = [ (x + 1/x)⁶ – (x⁶ + 1/x⁶) – 2 ] / [ (x + 1/x)³ + (x³ + 1/x³) ]
for x > 0.
Step 1. Make a substitution.
Let
  t = x + 1/x.
Then we know for any positive x that t ≥ 2. We also have the identities:
  x³ + 1/x³ = t³ – 3t
and
  x⁶ + 1/x⁶ = (x³ + 1/x³)² – 2 = (t³ – 3t)² – 2.
Step 2. Rewrite the numerator.
The numerator is
  (t)⁶ – [ (t³ – 3t)² – 2 ] – 2
  = t⁶ – (t³ – 3t)² + 2 – 2
  = t⁶ – (t³ – 3t)².
Expand (t³ – 3t)²:
  (t³ – 3t)² = t⁶ – 6t⁴ + 9t².
"Thus, the numerator becomes:"
  t⁶ – (t⁶ – 6t⁴ + 9t²) = 6t⁴ – 9t².
Step 3. Rewrite the denominator.
The denominator is
  (t)³ + (x³ + 1/x³) = t³ + (t³ – 3t) = 2t³ – 3t.
Step 4. Factor and simplify.
Factor common terms in the numerator and denominator:
  Numerator = 3t²(2t² – 3)
  Denom = t(2t² – 3).
"For t such that 2t² – 3 ≠ 0 (note that t = x + 1/x and for x > 0 we have t ≥ 2, so 2t² – 3 is positive), we can cancel the (2t² – 3) terms:"
  S = [3t²(2t² – 3)] / [t(2t² – 3)] = 3t.
Step 5. Find the minimum.
"Since S = 3t and t = x + 1/x, we look for the minimum value of x + 1/x for x > 0. It is well known that:"
"  x + 1/x ≥ 2,"
with equality when x = 1.
"Thus,"
"  Minimum S = 3(2) = 6,"
attained when x = 1.
Answer: 6.
