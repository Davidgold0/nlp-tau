Question: Find the minimum value of_x000D_
\[\frac{\left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^6 - \left( x^6 + \dfrac{1}{x^6} \right) - 2}{\left( x + \dfrac{1}{x} \right)^3 + \left( x^3 + \dfrac{1}{x^3} \right)}\]for $x > 0.$
Teacher: Let's start by restating the problem in our own words and planning our approach: We need to find the minimum value (for x > 0) of
  [(x + 1/x)⁶ − (x⁶ + 1/x⁶) − 2] / [(x + 1/x)³ + (x³ + 1/x³)].
"A common strategy for these kinds of expressions is to use a substitution that simplifies the expression. One promising substitution is to let t = x + 1/x. With this substitution, we can then express x³ + 1/x³ and x⁶ + 1/x⁶ in terms of t."
"Before we proceed further, could you work on the next step: derive the expressions for x³ + 1/x³ and x⁶ + 1/x⁶ in terms of t, where t = x + 1/x? Take your time and show your reasoning for each expression."
Student: Sure! Let's start by using the substitution \( t = x + \frac{1}{x} \).
"First, we need to derive the expression for \( x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} \) in terms of \( t \). We can use the identity:"
\[
x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} = \left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right)^3 - 3\left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right)
\]
"Substituting \( t \) into this identity, we get:"
\[
x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} = t^3 - 3t
\]
"Next, we need to derive the expression for \( x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6} \). We can use the identity:"
\[
x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6} = \left( x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} \right)^2 - 2
\]
"Now, substituting our expression for \( x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} \):"
\[
x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6} = (t^3 - 3t)^2 - 2
\]
"Now that we have both expressions, we can summarize:"
1. \( x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} = t^3 - 3t \)
2. \( x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6} = (t^3 - 3t)^2 - 2 \)
"With these expressions in terms of \( t \), we can now substitute them into the original equation. Would you like me to proceed with substituting these into the expression we need to minimize?"
Teacher: Great job! Your derivations are correct. You accurately showed that:
"1. x³ + 1/x³ = t³ – 3t, and  "
2. x⁶ + 1/x⁶ = (t³ – 3t)² – 2.
"The next step is to substitute these expressions into the original problem. Remember, our original expression is:"
  [(x + 1/x)⁶ − (x⁶ + 1/x⁶) − 2] / [(x + 1/x)³ + (x³ + 1/x³)]
"Given t = x + 1/x, could you substitute these expressions into the numerator and denominator and simplify the result as much as you can? Take your time and show your reasoning for each part of the substitution."
Student: Sure! Let's substitute the expressions we derived into the original equation step by step.
The original expression we want to minimize is:
\[
\frac{\left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right)^6 - \left( x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6} \right) - 2}{\left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right)^3 + \left( x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} \right)}
\]
"Using the substitution \( t = x + \frac{1}{x} \), we can rewrite the numerator and denominator."
**Numerator:**
1. We know that \( \left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right)^6 = t^6 \).
"2. Also, we derived \( x^6 + \frac{1}{x^6} = (t^3 - 3t)^2 - 2 \)."
"So, the numerator becomes:"
\[
t^6 - \left((t^3 - 3t)^2 - 2\right) - 2
\]
Simplifying this:
\[
t^6 - (t^3 - 3t)^2 + 2 - 2 = t^6 - (t^3 - 3t)^2
\]
**Denominator:**
1. We have \( \left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right)^3 = t^3 \).
2. And we derived \( x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} = t^3 - 3t \).
"So, the denominator becomes:"
\[
t^3 + (t^3 - 3t) = 2t^3 - 3t
\]
"Now, substituting these into the expression gives us:"
\[
\frac{t^6 - (t^3 - 3t)^2}{2t^3 - 3t}
\]
"Next, we need to simplify \( t^6 - (t^3 - 3t)^2 \). Let's expand \( (t^3 - 3t)^2 \):"
\[
(t^3 - 3t)^2 = t^6 - 6t^4 + 9t^2
\]
Now substituting this back into the numerator:
\[
t^6 - (t^6 - 6t^4 + 9t^2) = 6t^4 - 9t^2
\]
Now we have:
\[
\frac{6t^4 - 9t^2}{2t^3 - 3t}
\]
Factoring out \( 3t^2 \) from the numerator gives:
\[
\frac{3t^2(2t^2 - 3)}{t(2t^2 - 3)}
\]
"As long as \( t \neq 0 \) and \( 2t^2 - 3 \neq 0 \), we can simplify this to:"
\[
\frac{3t^2}{t} = 3t \quad \text{(for } t \neq 0 \text{ and } 2t^2 - 3 \neq 0\text{)}
\]
Now we have the simplified expression:
\[
3t
\]
"Next, we need to find the minimum value of \( 3t \) for \( x > 0 \). Since \( t = x + \frac{1}{x} \) and the minimum value of \( t \) occurs at \( x = 1 \), where \( t = 2 \)."
"Therefore, the minimum value of \( 3t \) is:"
\[
3 \times 2 = 6
\]
"So, the minimum value of the original expression is:"
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
Is there anything else you would like me to clarify or expand upon?
Teacher: Excellent work! Let's review what you did:
• You correctly substituted t = x + 1/x and expressed x³ + 1/x³ as t³ – 3t and x⁶ + 1/x⁶ as (t³ – 3t)² – 2.  
• Then you replaced these in the original expression so that the numerator became t⁶ – (t³ – 3t)² and the denominator became 2t³ – 3t.  
"• After expanding (t³ – 3t)² and simplifying, you factored the numerator and denominator to get 3t²(2t² – 3) divided by t(2t² – 3), which simplified to 3t (after canceling common factors under the valid conditions).  "
"• Since t = x + 1/x for x > 0, and the minimum value of t is 2 (attained when x = 1), you correctly concluded that the minimum value of 3t is 3×2 = 6."
Fantastic reasoning!
