Question: Compute_x000D_
\[\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 0 & -1 \\ 7 & 4 & -3 \\ 2 & 2 & 5 \end{vmatrix}.\]
Teacher: Great! Let's work through the problem together. We need to compute the determinant of the matrix
  | 2   0   -1 |  
  | 7   4   -3 |  
  | 2   2   5  |
A good way to start is by using the cofactor expansion (also called Laplace expansion). One common method is to expand along the first row. 
Step 1: Write down the formula for the determinant using cofactor expansion along the first row. 
Can you tell me what the formula is when you expand the determinant along the first row? (Remember to include the signs associated with each element.)
"Student: Sure! When we expand the determinant along the first row, we take each element of the row and multiply it by its corresponding cofactor, which includes a sign based on its position. "
The formula for the determinant using cofactor expansion along the first row is:
\[
\begin{vmatrix} 
2 & 0 & -1 \\ 
7 & 4 & -3 \\ 
2 & 2 & 5 
\end{vmatrix} = 
2 \cdot C_{11} + 0 \cdot C_{12} + (-1) \cdot C_{13}
\]
where \(C_{ij}\) is the cofactor of the element in the \(i\)-th row and \(j\)-th column. 
"The signs for the cofactors are determined by the pattern \((-1)^{i+j}\), so for the first row:"
"- For \(2\) (first element), the sign is \(+1\) (since \(1+1=2\))."
"- For \(0\) (second element), the sign is \(-1\) (since \(1+2=3\))."
"- For \(-1\) (third element), the sign is \(+1\) (since \(1+3=4\))."
So the formula simplifies to:
\[
= 2 \cdot C_{11} + 0 \cdot C_{12} - 1 \cdot C_{13}
\]
"Now, we need to calculate the cofactors \(C_{11}\) and \(C_{13}\). Would you like me to proceed with that?"
Teacher: Great job explaining the cofactor expansion along the first row! Your formula and understanding of the sign pattern are spot on.
Let's move to the next step:
"Step 2: Compute the cofactor C₁₁ for the element in the first row, first column (which is 2). To do that, you need to form the 2×2 submatrix by removing the first row and the first column, and then compute its determinant."
Can you show me how you would set up that submatrix and compute its determinant? Please work out just this step.
"Student: Sure! To compute the cofactor \(C_{11}\) for the element in the first row, first column (which is 2), I need to remove the first row and the first column from the original matrix. "
The original matrix is:
\[
\begin{vmatrix} 
2 & 0 & -1 \\ 
7 & 4 & -3 \\ 
2 & 2 & 5 
\end{vmatrix}
\]
"After removing the first row and first column, the remaining 2×2 submatrix is:"
\[
\begin{vmatrix} 
4 & -3 \\ 
2 & 5 
\end{vmatrix}
\]
"Now, I will compute the determinant of this 2×2 submatrix using the formula for the determinant of a 2×2 matrix, which is given by:"
\[
\text{det} \begin{vmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{vmatrix} = ad - bc
\]
For our submatrix:
- \(a = 4\)
- \(b = -3\)
- \(c = 2\)
- \(d = 5\)
"So, the determinant is:"
\[
\text{det} \begin{vmatrix} 4 & -3 \\ 2 & 5 \end{vmatrix} = (4)(5) - (-3)(2) = 20 + 6 = 26
\]
"Thus, \(C_{11} = 26\). Would you like me to proceed with calculating \(C_{13}\) next?"
"Teacher: Great job working through the computation for C₁₁ correctly! You formed the 2×2 submatrix and computed its determinant accurately, and you noted that the sign for C₁₁ is positive. "
Now let's move on to the next step:
"Step 3: Compute the cofactor C₁₃ for the element in the first row, third column (which is –1). This involves forming the 2×2 submatrix by removing the first row and the third column, and then computing its determinant. Remember to include the appropriate sign based on (–1)^(i+j) for C₁₃."
"Could you please set up the 2×2 submatrix for C₁₃, compute its determinant, and apply the correct sign? Let's work through this single step together."
"Student: Student: Sure! To compute the cofactor \(C_{13}\) for the element in the first row, third column (which is \(-1\)), I need to remove the first row and the third column from the original matrix. "
The original matrix is:
\[
\begin{vmatrix} 
2 & 0 & -1 \\ 
7 & 4 & -3 \\ 
2 & 2 & 5 
\end{vmatrix}
\]
"After removing the first row and the third column, the remaining 2×2 submatrix is:"
\[
\begin{vmatrix} 
7 & 4 \\ 
2 & 2 
\end{vmatrix}
\]
"Now, I will compute the determinant of this 2×2 submatrix using the formula for the determinant of a 2×2 matrix:"
\[
\text{det} \begin{vmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{vmatrix} = ad - bc
\]
For our submatrix:
- \(a = 7\)
- \(b = 4\)
- \(c = 2\)
- \(d = 2\)
"So, the determinant is:"
\[
\text{det} \begin{vmatrix} 7 & 4 \\ 2 & 2 \end{vmatrix} = (7)(2) - (4)(2) = 14 - 8 = 6
\]
"Now, since the sign for \(C_{13}\) is determined by \((-1)^{1+3} = (-1)^{4} = +1\), we have:"
\[
C_{13} = 6
\]
Would you like me to continue and substitute \(C_{11}\) and \(C_{13}\) back into the determinant formula?
Teacher: Excellent work computing both C₁₁ and C₁₃! Now it's time for the final step:
"Step 4: Substitute the computed cofactors into the cofactor expansion formula along the first row, and then simplify the expression to obtain the determinant. The formula we derived earlier was:"
 Determinant = 2 × C₁₁ + 0 × C₁₂ – 1 × C₁₃
You have found:
 C₁₁ = 26  
 C₁₃ = 6
Could you please substitute these values into the formula and simplify the expression to compute the determinant? Remember to show your work step by step.
Student: Sure! Let's substitute the values of \(C_{11}\) and \(C_{13}\) back into the cofactor expansion formula for the determinant:
The formula we derived earlier was:
\[
\text{Determinant} = 2 \cdot C_{11} + 0 \cdot C_{12} - 1 \cdot C_{13}
\]
Now substituting the values we found:
- \(C_{11} = 26\)
- \(C_{13} = 6\)
"So, we have:"
\[
\text{Determinant} = 2 \cdot 26 + 0 \cdot C_{12} - 1 \cdot 6
\]
Calculating each term:
1. \(2 \cdot 26 = 52\)
2. \(0 \cdot C_{12} = 0\)
3. \(-1 \cdot 6 = -6\)
"Now, combining these results gives us:"
\[
\text{Determinant} = 52 + 0 - 6 = 52 - 6 = 46
\]
"Thus, the determinant of the matrix is:"
\[
\boxed{46}
\] 
Thank you for guiding me through this process!
"Teacher: Great work working through all the steps! You've correctly set up the cofactor expansion along the first row, computed each of the required cofactors, and substituted them to simplify the expression. To summarize briefly:"
1. We expanded along the first row:
  Determinant = 2 × C₁₁ + 0 × C₁₂ – 1 × C₁₃.
"2. For C₁₁, by deleting the first row and first column, you obtained the 2×2 matrix [4, -3; 2, 5] and computed its determinant as 26."
"3. For C₁₃, by deleting the first row and third column, you obtained the 2×2 matrix [7, 4; 2, 2] and computed its determinant as 6."
"4. Finally, substituting these into the expansion: 2×26 − 1×6 = 52 − 6 = 46."
Excellent job! The final answer is:
46$
