Question: Compute_x000D_
\[\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 0 & -1 \\ 7 & 4 & -3 \\ 2 & 2 & 5 \end{vmatrix}.\]
3o-mini: We want to compute the determinant of the matrix
  | 2 0 –1 |
  | 7 4 –3 |
  | 2 2  5 |.
One way to solve this is by expanding along the first row.
Step 1. Write the determinant using cofactor expansion:
  det = 2 × det| 4 –3 |
          | 2  5 | 
     – 0 × (cofactor) 
      + (–1) × det| 7 4 |
            | 2 2 |.
Step 2. Compute the 2×2 determinants:
For the first 2×2 matrix:
  det| 4 –3 |
     | 2  5 | = (4)(5) – (–3)(2) = 20 + 6 = 26.
For the second 2×2 matrix:
  det| 7 4 |
     | 2 2 | = (7)(2) – (4)(2) = 14 – 8 = 6.
Step 3. Substitute back into the expansion:
  det = 2*(26) – 0 + (–1)*(6)
     = 52 – 6 
     = 46.
"Thus, the determinant of the matrix is 46."
