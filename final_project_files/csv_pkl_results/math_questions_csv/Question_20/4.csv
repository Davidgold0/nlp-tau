Question: Compute_x000D_
\[\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 0 & -1 \\ 7 & 4 & -3 \\ 2 & 2 & 5 \end{vmatrix}.\]
Teacher: Let's start by outlining the approach for computing the determinant of this 3x3 matrix. One common way is to use the cofactor expansion (also known as Laplace’s expansion). To break it down:
"1. Choose a row or column to expand along (for example, the first row)."
"2. For each element in that row, compute its cofactor, which involves:"
   a. Determining the minor—a 2x2 determinant formed by removing the row and column of that element.
"   b. Applying the sign based on the position using the pattern (+, −, +, ...)."
3. Multiply each element of the chosen row by its corresponding cofactor.
4. Sum these products to get the determinant.
"Now, please tell me what you would do first in this process. Which row or column would you like to expand along, and could you explain your choice?"
"Student: I would like to expand along the first row of the matrix. The first row is \( [2, 0, -1] \). "
"I chose the first row because it has a zero in the second position, which simplifies the calculation. When we expand using cofactor expansion, any term multiplied by zero will contribute nothing to the determinant, so we only need to calculate the cofactors for the first and third elements."
"Now, I will compute the cofactors for the first and third elements of the first row. The first element is \(2\) and the third element is \(-1\). "
"Next, I will determine the minors for these elements. Would you like me to proceed with finding the minors for the first and third elements?"
"Teacher: Great choice expanding along the first row. Now, as the next step, please find the 2x2 minors corresponding to the nonzero elements in the first row."
"For the element 2 in the first row, first column: Remove the first row and first column. What is the resulting 2x2 matrix and its determinant?"
"For the element -1 in the first row, third column: Remove the first row and third column. What is the resulting 2x2 matrix and its determinant?"
"Please compute these minors, and tell me your work for each one."
"Student: Student: Okay, let's start with the first element, which is \(2\) in the first row, first column. To find the minor for this element, I will remove the first row and the first column from the matrix:"
\[
\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 0 & -1 \\ 7 & 4 & -3 \\ 2 & 2 & 5 \end{vmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{vmatrix} 4 & -3 \\ 2 & 5 \end{vmatrix}
\]
"Now, I will compute the determinant of this 2x2 matrix:"
\[
\text{Determinant} = (4)(5) - (-3)(2) = 20 + 6 = 26
\]
"So, the minor for the element \(2\) is \(26\)."
"Next, I will find the minor for the element \(-1\) in the first row, third column. To do this, I will remove the first row and the third column from the matrix:"
\[
\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 0 & -1 \\ 7 & 4 & -3 \\ 2 & 2 & 5 \end{vmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{vmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 7 & 4 \end{vmatrix}
\]
"Now, I will compute the determinant of this 2x2 matrix:"
\[
\text{Determinant} = (2)(4) - (0)(7) = 8 - 0 = 8
\]
"So, the minor for the element \(-1\) is \(8\)."
To summarize:
- The minor for the element \(2\) is \(26\).
- The minor for the element \(-1\) is \(8\).
Would you like me to proceed with calculating the cofactors using these minors?
"Teacher: Great work finding the minors! Now let's move on to calculating the cofactors for these nonzero elements. Remember, the cofactor for an element in position (i, j) is given by (–1)^(i+j) times the minor for that element."
"For the first element, 2 in position (1, 1):"
• What is the sign factor (–1)^(1+1)?
• Multiply that by the minor you found (26).
"For the third element, –1 in position (1, 3):"
• What is the sign factor (–1)^(1+3)?
• Multiply that by the minor you found (8).
Please compute these two cofactors and then write them out. Let me know what you get for each cofactor.
"Student: Student: Alright, let's calculate the cofactors for the elements \(2\) and \(-1\)."
"1. **For the element \(2\) in position (1, 1)**:"
   - The sign factor is \((-1)^{1+1} = (-1)^2 = 1\).
"   - Now, I multiply this sign factor by the minor \(26\):"
     \[
     \text{Cofactor} = 1 \times 26 = 26.
     \]
"2. **For the element \(-1\) in position (1, 3)**:"
   - The sign factor is \((-1)^{1+3} = (-1)^4 = 1\).
"   - Now, I multiply this sign factor by the minor \(8\):"
     \[
     \text{Cofactor} = 1 \times 8 = 8.
     \]
To summarize:
- The cofactor for the element \(2\) is \(26\).
- The cofactor for the element \(-1\) is \(8\).
Would you like me to proceed with summing these products to find the determinant?
"Teacher: Great work on calculating the cofactors! Now, the next step is to compute the contributions of the nonzero elements of the first row by multiplying each element by its corresponding cofactor. Remember that even though you computed the cofactors, you now need to multiply the actual matrix entry with that cofactor."
"For the element 2 in the first row, first column:"
• Multiply 2 by its cofactor (26).
"For the element –1 in the first row, third column:"
• Multiply –1 by its cofactor (8).
"What is the result of these multiplications, and what do you get when you add these two results together? Please show your work for this step."
Student: Student: Sure! Let's compute the contributions of the nonzero elements of the first row by multiplying each element by its corresponding cofactor.
"1. **For the element \(2\) in the first row, first column**:"
   - We have already found that the cofactor for \(2\) is \(26\).
"   - Now, I will multiply:"
     \[
     2 \times 26 = 52.
     \]
"2. **For the element \(-1\) in the first row, third column**:"
   - The cofactor for \(-1\) is \(8\).
"   - Now, I will multiply:"
     \[
     -1 \times 8 = -8.
     \]
"Now, I will add these two results together to find the determinant:"
\[
52 + (-8) = 52 - 8 = 44.
\]
"So, the determinant of the matrix is \(44\). Would you like me to summarize the entire process or is there anything else you would like to discuss?"
Teacher: Great job! Let’s quickly summarize what you did:
"1. You chose the first row to expand along, noting that the zero simplifies the calculation."
2. You computed the two important 2×2 minors:
"   - For the element 2 (position 1,1), you removed the first row and column to get the matrix [4, -3; 2, 5] whose determinant is 26."
"   - For the element –1 (position 1,3), you removed the first row and third column to get the matrix [2, 0; 7, 4] whose determinant is 8."
3. You then found the corresponding cofactors using the sign factors:
"   - For 2, the cofactor is 1×26 = 26."
"   - For –1, the cofactor is 1×8 = 8."
"4. Finally, you multiplied the nonzero elements of the first row by their cofactors and summed the results:"
"   - 2×26 = 52 and –1×8 = –8, so 52 + (–8) = 44."
Your final answer is 44.
