"Question: One year ago, the number of years in Jane's age was a perfect square, and one year from now, her age will be a perfect cube. How many years old is Jane?"
3o-mini: Let Jane's current age be A.
According to the problem:
"• One year ago, her age was A – 1, which is a perfect square."
"• One year from now, her age will be A + 1, which is a perfect cube."
"Let A – 1 = n² for some integer n, and A + 1 = m³ for some integer m. Then:"
 A = n² + 1   (1)
 A = m³ – 1   (2)
Setting the right-hand sides equal:
 n² + 1 = m³ – 1
 n² = m³ – 2
We need to find integers m and n satisfying n² = m³ – 2.
Trying small values for m:
"• For m = 2: n² = 8 – 2 = 6, which is not a perfect square."
"• For m = 3: n² = 27 – 2 = 25, and 25 is a perfect square (n = 5)."
"So when m = 3 and n = 5, we have:"
 A = n² + 1 = 25 + 1 = 26
 A = m³ – 1 = 27 – 1 = 26
"Therefore, Jane is 26 years old."
