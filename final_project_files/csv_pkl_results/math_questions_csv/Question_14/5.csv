"Question: One year ago, the number of years in Jane's age was a perfect square, and one year from now, her age will be a perfect cube. How many years old is Jane?"
Teacher: Let’s break down the problem into steps before diving in:
"Step 1: Define a variable for Jane’s current age and express the two conditions as equations. One year ago, her age was a perfect square and one year from now, her age will be a perfect cube."
"For example, if we let x be Jane’s current age, then:"
 • x – 1 = (an integer)²  [perfect square condition]
 • x + 1 = (an integer)³  [perfect cube condition]
"Now, please write these relationships as equations using variables for the square and cube (for instance, n for the square root and m for the cube root). What are the expressions you come up with?"
"Student: Okay, I understand the task. If we let \( x \) be Jane's current age, then based on the conditions provided:"
"1. One year ago, her age was a perfect square:  "
   \( x - 1 = n^2 \) (where \( n \) is an integer)
"2. One year from now, her age will be a perfect cube:  "
   \( x + 1 = m^3 \) (where \( m \) is an integer)
"So, the equations we have are:"
- \( x - 1 = n^2 \)
- \( x + 1 = m^3 \)
Is this correct? What should I do next?
Teacher: Great job expressing the relationships correctly!
"Next, let’s take the next step. We already have these two equations:"
  x – 1 = n²  
  x + 1 = m³
"A common strategy is to eliminate x by writing x in terms of n (or m) and substituting into the other equation. Could you do that? Specifically, try expressing x from one equation and substituting it into the other. What relationship do you get between n and m? Please share your work for this step."
Student: Sure! Let's express \( x \) in terms of \( n \) from the first equation and substitute it into the second equation.
From the first equation:
\[ x - 1 = n^2 \]
We can solve for \( x \):
\[ x = n^2 + 1 \]
"Now, we substitute this expression for \( x \) into the second equation:"
\[ x + 1 = m^3 \]
Substituting \( x \):
\[ (n^2 + 1) + 1 = m^3 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ n^2 + 2 = m^3 \]
Now we have the relationship between \( n \) and \( m \):
\[ m^3 - n^2 = 2 \]
What should I do next with this equation?
Teacher: That's a clear and correct derivation of the equation m³ – n² = 2.
"Now, the next step is to find integers m and n that satisfy this equation. A common approach is to test small positive integers for m and see which value gives you an integer n. "
For example:
1. Substitute a small value for m and compute m³ – 2.
"2. See if that result is a perfect square (i.e., if n² = m³ – 2 for some integer n)."
"Can you try this process for m = 1, 2, 3, and so on? Let’s start with m = 1 and then move to m = 2, m = 3, etc. What do you get for each, and which one gives you a perfect square for n²?"
Student: Sure! Let’s start testing small values for \( m \) and see if we can find a corresponding perfect square for \( n^2 \).
1. **For \( m = 1 \)**:
   \[
   m^3 - 2 = 1^3 - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1
   \]
   This is not a perfect square.
2. **For \( m = 2 \)**:
   \[
   m^3 - 2 = 2^3 - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6
   \]
   This is not a perfect square.
3. **For \( m = 3 \)**:
   \[
   m^3 - 2 = 3^3 - 2 = 27 - 2 = 25
   \]
"   This is a perfect square because \( 25 = 5^2 \). So, \( n = 5 \)."
Now we have \( m = 3 \) and \( n = 5 \). 
"Next, we can use these values to find Jane's current age \( x \). We can use either of the equations we derived earlier. Let’s use:"
\[
x = n^2 + 1 = 5^2 + 1 = 25 + 1 = 26
\]
"So, Jane's current age is \( 26 \) years old."
Is this the right approach? What should I do next?
"Teacher: Great work so far! You correctly found m = 3 and n = 5. Now, the next step is to use one of the equations to find Jane’s current age x. Remember, you can use:"
  x = n² + 1
"Could you use this equation (or the other one) to calculate Jane’s age? After that, make sure to verify the result by checking that x + 1 equals m³. Please show your work for this step."
"Student: Sure! We already established that \( n = 5 \) and \( m = 3 \). Now, let's calculate Jane's current age \( x \) using the equation:"
\[
x = n^2 + 1
\]
Substituting \( n = 5 \) into the equation:
\[
x = 5^2 + 1 = 25 + 1 = 26
\]
"So, Jane's current age is \( 26 \) years old."
"Now, let's verify this result by checking the second condition using the other equation:"
\[
x + 1 = m^3
\]
Substituting \( x = 26 \) and \( m = 3 \):
\[
x + 1 = 26 + 1 = 27
\]
\[
m^3 = 3^3 = 27
\]
Both conditions are satisfied since \( x + 1 = 27 \) equals \( m^3 = 27 \).
"Thus, Jane's current age is indeed \( 26 \) years old. Is there anything else you would like me to do?"
"Teacher: Excellent work! You carefully tested values for m, found that m = 3 and n = 5, and then correctly computed Jane’s current age as x = n² + 1 = 26. You also verified the second condition by checking that 26 + 1 equals 27, which is 3³. "
To summarize our process:
"1. We defined x as Jane's current age, with x - 1 = n² and x + 1 = m³."
2. We expressed x in terms of n and substituted into the cube equation to get m³ – n² = 2.
"3. By testing small integer values for m, we found m = 3 and n = 5."
"4. Finally, we computed x = 5² + 1 = 26 and verified that this satisfies x + 1 = 3³."
"Thus, Jane's current age is 26$"
