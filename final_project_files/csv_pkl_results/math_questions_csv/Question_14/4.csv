"Question: One year ago, the number of years in Jane's age was a perfect square, and one year from now, her age will be a perfect cube. How many years old is Jane?"
Teacher: Let's start with understanding the problem. We need to represent Jane's age with a variable and use the clues about perfect squares and perfect cubes. 
"Step 1: Let’s denote Jane’s current age by x. One year ago means her age was x - 1, and we are told that this number was a perfect square. Similarly, one year from now, her age will be x + 1, which is given to be a perfect cube."
"Can you write two equations based on these conditions using new variables (say, n for the perfect square and m for the perfect cube)? Please show your equations for this step."
"Student: Sure! Based on the information given, we can set up the following equations:"
"1. Since one year ago Jane's age was a perfect square, we can write:"
   \[
   x - 1 = n^2
   \]
   where \( n \) is some integer.
"2. Since one year from now Jane's age will be a perfect cube, we can write:"
   \[
   x + 1 = m^3
   \]
   where \( m \) is also some integer.
"So, our two equations are:"
1. \( x - 1 = n^2 \)
2. \( x + 1 = m^3 \)
Now we have the equations set up. What should we do next?
"Teacher: Great job on setting up the equations correctly! Now, let’s move to the next step."
We have:
  x - 1 = n²  …(1)
  x + 1 = m³  …(2)
A good next step would be to eliminate x by subtracting equation (1) from equation (2). Try to do that subtraction and simplify the resulting equation.
What equation do you get after subtracting (1) from (2)? Please show your work for this step.
Student: Sure! Let's subtract equation (1) from equation (2):
From equation (2):
\[
x + 1 = m^3
\]
From equation (1):
\[
x - 1 = n^2
\]
"Now, subtract equation (1) from equation (2):"
\[
(x + 1) - (x - 1) = m^3 - n^2
\]
Simplifying the left side:
\[
x + 1 - x + 1 = m^3 - n^2
\]
\[
2 = m^3 - n^2
\]
"So, the equation we get after subtracting (1) from (2) is:"
\[
m^3 - n^2 = 2
\]
What should we do next with this equation?
Teacher: Great work so far! Now we have the equation:
  m³ – n² = 2
The next step is to find integer values for m and n that satisfy this equation. Here's how we can approach it:
1. Think about possible small integer values for m.
"2. For each candidate m, compute m³ and then rearrange the equation to get n² = m³ – 2."
"3. Check whether n² is a perfect square (i.e., whether its square root is an integer)."
"To proceed, please try picking a small value for m (for example, m = 2) and see what you get for n². What is your calculation for n² when m = 2? Let me know your result and reasoning for this step."
Student: Student: Okay! Let's start by trying \( m = 2 \) as you suggested.
Calculating \( m^3 \):
\[
m^3 = 2^3 = 8
\]
"Now, we can substitute this value into the equation \( n^2 = m^3 - 2 \):"
\[
n^2 = 8 - 2 = 6
\]
"Next, we need to check if \( n^2 = 6 \) is a perfect square. The square root of 6 is approximately 2.45, which is not an integer. So, \( n^2 = 6 \) does not give us a valid integer value for \( n \)."
Let's try the next integer value for \( m \). How about \( m = 3 \)? 
Calculating \( m^3 \) for \( m = 3 \):
\[
m^3 = 3^3 = 27
\]
"Now, substituting this into the equation for \( n^2 \):"
\[
n^2 = 27 - 2 = 25
\]
"Now, we check if \( n^2 = 25 \) is a perfect square:"
"The square root of 25 is 5, which is an integer. "
"So, we have \( n = 5 \) and \( m = 3 \). "
"Now, can you guide me on the next steps to find Jane's current age \( x \)?"
"Teacher: You've determined that m = 3 and n = 5 satisfy the equation m³ – n² = 2. Now, let's move on to the next step."
We have two equations:
  x – 1 = n²  
  x + 1 = m³
"Using the first equation (x – 1 = n²), substitute n = 5 to solve for x. "
Please calculate x by solving x – 1 = 5². Show your work and let me know what you find for x.
Student: Sure! Let's use the equation \( x - 1 = n^2 \) and substitute \( n = 5 \):
\[
x - 1 = 5^2
\]
Calculating \( 5^2 \):
\[
5^2 = 25
\]
Now we can substitute that back into the equation:
\[
x - 1 = 25
\]
"To find \( x \), we add 1 to both sides:"
\[
x = 25 + 1
\]
\[
x = 26
\]
"So, Jane's current age is \( 26 \) years old. "
"Now, can you confirm that this value satisfies both conditions of the problem?"
"Teacher: You're doing a great job! To confirm Jane's age satisfies the conditions, you need to check both equations:"
• First equation: x – 1 = n²  
"  Substitute n = 5 and x = 26: 26 – 1 = 25, which equals 5²."
• Second equation: x + 1 = m³  
"  Substitute m = 3 and x = 26: 26 + 1 = 27, which equals 3³."
"Since both conditions hold true, you have verified that x = 26 works."
"Now, please confirm your explanation of why both conditions are satisfied. Once you verify and summarize this reasoning, you can provide the final answer for Jane's age."
Student: Sure! Let's confirm that Jane's age of 26 satisfies both conditions:
1. **Condition for Perfect Square**:
"   - One year ago, Jane's age was \( x - 1 = 26 - 1 = 25 \)."
"   - We know that \( 25 \) is a perfect square because \( 5^2 = 25 \). Thus, this condition is satisfied."
2. **Condition for Perfect Cube**:
"   - One year from now, Jane's age will be \( x + 1 = 26 + 1 = 27 \)."
"   - We know that \( 27 \) is a perfect cube because \( 3^3 = 27 \). Thus, this condition is also satisfied."
"Since both conditions are satisfied, we can confidently conclude that Jane's current age is:"
**Final Answer**: Jane is 26 years old.
Teacher: That's a well-reasoned explanation and confirmation. You have verified that one year ago Jane's age was 25 (which is 5²) and one year from now it will be 27 (which is 3³). 
Your final answer is:
26$
