"Question: One year ago, the number of years in Jane's age was a perfect square, and one year from now, her age will be a perfect cube. How many years old is Jane?"
3o-mini: Let Jane's age be x. According to the problem:
"• One year ago, her age was a perfect square: x – 1 = n² (for some integer n)"
"• One year from now, her age will be a perfect cube: x + 1 = m³ (for some integer m)"
"From these, we have:"
 x = n² + 1 and x = m³ – 1
Setting them equal:
 n² + 1 = m³ – 1  
 n² = m³ – 2
We now look for small integer values of m such that m³ – 2 is a perfect square.
Try m = 2:
 2³ – 2 = 8 – 2 = 6  (Not a perfect square)
Try m = 3:
" 3³ – 2 = 27 – 2 = 25, which is 5² (a perfect square)"
"So, with n = 5 and m = 3 we find:"
 x = m³ – 1 = 27 – 1 = 26
"Thus, one year ago Jane was 25 (a perfect square), and one year from now she will be 27 (a perfect cube)."
Answer: Jane is 26 years old.
