"Question: Let \[P(x) = (2x^4 - 26x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c)(5x^4 - 80x^3 + dx^2 + ex + f),\]where $a, b, c, d, e, f$ are real numbers. Suppose that the set of all complex roots of $P(x)$ is $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}.$ Find $P(6).$"
"Teacher: Okay, let’s start by breaking the problem down."
We have the polynomial
"  P(x) = (2x⁴ − 26x³ + ax² + bx + c) · (5x⁴ − 80x³ + dx² + ex + f),"
"and we’re told the complete set of its roots is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (with multiplicities) while P(x) is of degree 8. Notice that each factor is a quartic (degree 4), so each factor has exactly 4 roots (with possible repeats), and together they contribute a total of 8 roots for P(x)."
"A clever observation is to use the fact that the sum of the roots of each quartic can be found by the coefficient of the x³ term. For a general quartic ax⁴ + bx³ + …, the sum of its roots is –(b/a). So for the first factor, with leading coefficient 2 and x³ coefficient –26, the sum of its 4 roots is"
  –(–26)/2 = 13.
"Similarly, for the second factor (leading coefficient 5 and x³ coefficient –80), the sum of its roots is"
  –(–80)/5 = 16.
"Since all the roots of P(x) are among {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, we can think of assigning multiplicities in each quartic. In the first quartic factor, if you denote the multiplicity assigned to the root r by m₁(r) (for r in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}), then"
"  m₁(1) + m₁(2) + m₁(3) + m₁(4) + m₁(5) = 4,"
and
  1·m₁(1) + 2·m₁(2) + 3·m₁(3) + 4·m₁(4) + 5·m₁(5) = 13.
Let’s begin by tackling this part of the problem.
What possible assignment of multiplicities m₁(r) (where only nonnegative integers are allowed and their sum is 4) yields a weighted sum of 13 for the first factor? Please solve this first step by listing and explaining the possible set of multiplicities that work for the first factor.
"Student: To find the possible assignments of multiplicities \( m_1(r) \) for the roots \( \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \) in the first quartic polynomial, we need to satisfy two conditions:"
1. The total multiplicity must equal 4:
   \[
   m_1(1) + m_1(2) + m_1(3) + m_1(4) + m_1(5) = 4
   \]
2. The weighted sum of the roots must equal 13:
   \[
   1 \cdot m_1(1) + 2 \cdot m_1(2) + 3 \cdot m_1(3) + 4 \cdot m_1(4) + 5 \cdot m_1(5) = 13
   \]
Let’s denote the multiplicities as follows:
- \( m_1(1) = a \)
- \( m_1(2) = b \)
- \( m_1(3) = c \)
- \( m_1(4) = d \)
- \( m_1(5) = e \)
So we have the equations:
1. \( a + b + c + d + e = 4 \)
2. \( a + 2b + 3c + 4d + 5e = 13 \)
"Now, we can explore nonnegative integer solutions for these equations. "
### Exploring Possible Combinations
We can start by considering the maximum value of \( e \) (the multiplicity of the root 5) since it contributes the most to the weighted sum. 
1. **If \( e = 2 \)**:
   - Then \( a + b + c + d = 2 \)
"   - The weighted sum becomes \( a + 2b + 3c + 4d + 10 = 13 \), which simplifies to \( a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 3 \)."
   - Let's explore possible values:
     - \( d = 0 \): \( a + 2b + 3c = 3 \)
"       - \( c = 0 \): \( a + 2b = 3 \) gives \( (3,0,0,0,2) \) → \( m_1(1) = 3, m_1(2) = 0, m_1(3) = 0, m_1(4) = 0, m_1(5) = 2 \)"
"       - \( c = 1 \): \( a + 2b = 0 \) gives \( (0,0,1,0,2) \) → \( m_1(1) = 0, m_1(2) = 0, m_1(3) = 1, m_1(4) = 0, m_1(5) = 2 \)"
     - \( d = 1 \): \( a + 2b + 3c = -1 \) (not possible)
"     - Thus, valid combinations for \( e = 2 \) are \( (3,0,0,0,2) \) and \( (0,0,1,0,2) \)."
2. **If \( e = 1 \)**:
   - Then \( a + b + c + d = 3 \)
"   - The weighted sum becomes \( a + 2b + 3c + 4d + 5 = 13 \), which simplifies to \( a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 8 \)."
   - Exploring possible values:
     - \( d = 0 \): \( a + 2b + 3c = 8 \) (not possible with \( a + b + c = 3 \))
     - \( d = 1 \): \( a + 2b + 3c = 4 \)
"       - \( c = 0 \): \( a + 2b = 4 \) gives \( (4,0,0,1,1) \) → \( m_1(1) = 4, m_1(2) = 0, m_1(3) = 0, m_1(4) = 1, m_1(5) = 1 \)"
"       - \( c = 1 \): \( a + 2b = 1 \) gives \( (1,0,1,1,1) \) → \( m_1(1) = 1, m_1(2) = 0, m_1(3) = 1, m_1(4) = 1, m_1(5) = 1 \)"
"     - \( d = 2 \): \( a + 2b + 3c = 0 \) gives \( (0,0,0,2,1) \) → \( m_1(1) = 0, m_1(2) = 0, m_1(3) = 0, m_1(4) = 2, m_1(5) = 1 \)"
3. **If \( e = 0 \)**:
   - Then \( a + b + c + d = 4 \)
   - The weighted sum becomes \( a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 13 \) (not possible)
### Summary of Valid Combinations
"After exploring the possibilities, the valid combinations of multiplicities \( m_1(r) \) for the first factor are:"
"1. \( (3, 0, 0, 0, 2) \) → \( m_1(1) = 3, m_1(2) = 0, m_1(3) = 0, m_1(4) = 0, m_1(5) = 2 \)"
"2. \( (0, 0, 1, 0, 2) \) → \( m_1(1) = 0, m_1(2) = 0, m_1(3) = 1, m_1(4) = 0, m_1(5) = 2 \)"
"3. \( (4, 0, 0, 1, 1) \) → \( m_1(1) = 4, m_1(2) = 0, m_1(3) = 0, m_1(4) = 1, m_1(5) = 1 \)"
"4. \( (1, 0, 1, 1, 1) \) → \( m_1(1) = 1, m_1(2) = 0, m_1(3) = 1, m_1(4) = 1, m_1(5) = 1 \)"
"5. \( (0, 0, 0, 2, 1) \) → \( m_1(1) = 0, m_1(2) = 0, m_1(3) = 0, m_1(4) = 2, m_1(5) = 1 \)"
We can now move on to the second quartic polynomial and analyze how we can assign the remaining roots. Would you like to proceed with that?
Teacher: Great job on exploring the possibilities for the first factor. Now let’s turn our attention to the second quartic factor.
"Recall that for the second factor, we have a polynomial of degree 4 of the form"
  5x⁴ − 80x³ + dx² + ex + f.
"Using the formula for the sum of the roots, we note that the sum of the roots for this quartic is –(–80)/5 = 16. So if we let m₂(r) be the multiplicity of the root r in the second factor (with r ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}), then the two needed conditions are:"
1. m₂(1) + m₂(2) + m₂(3) + m₂(4) + m₂(5) = 4   [since it is a quartic]
2. 1·m₂(1) + 2·m₂(2) + 3·m₂(3) + 4·m₂(4) + 5·m₂(5) = 16
"Furthermore, recall that overall (from both factors) each of the roots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 must appear at least once. In other words, if you already have an assignment for m₁(r) from the first factor, then for each r you must have m₁(r) + m₂(r) ≥ 1."
To proceed:
• Rephrase the task for the second polynomial in your own words.
"• Then, list and explain the possible assignments of the m₂(r)’s (nonnegative integers) that satisfy the sum condition (total multiplicity equals 4) and the weighted sum condition (weighted sum equals 16)."
Please work on this next step and share your analysis for the second factor’s multiplicities.
Student: To analyze the second quartic polynomial 
\[
"5x^4 - 80x^3 + dx^2 + ex + f,"
\]
"we need to determine the multiplicities \( m_2(r) \) for the roots \( \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \) that satisfy the following conditions:"
1. The total multiplicity must equal 4:
   \[
   m_2(1) + m_2(2) + m_2(3) + m_2(4) + m_2(5) = 4.
   \]
2. The weighted sum of the roots must equal 16:
   \[
   1 \cdot m_2(1) + 2 \cdot m_2(2) + 3 \cdot m_2(3) + 4 \cdot m_2(4) + 5 \cdot m_2(5) = 16.
   \]
"Additionally, since we already assigned multiplicities for the first quartic polynomial, we must ensure that for each root \( r \), the total multiplicity from both factors is at least 1:"
\[
m_1(r) + m_2(r) \geq 1.
\]
### Rephrasing the Task
"We need to find nonnegative integer solutions for the multiplicities \( m_2(1), m_2(2), m_2(3), m_2(4), m_2(5) \) that satisfy the two equations above while also considering the multiplicities assigned in the first quartic polynomial."
### Exploring Possible Combinations
Let's consider the possible values of \( m_2(r) \) based on the combinations we found for \( m_1(r) \). We will analyze the combinations of \( m_1(r) \) that we have already established:
"1. \( (3, 0, 0, 0, 2) \)"
"2. \( (0, 0, 1, 0, 2) \)"
"3. \( (4, 0, 0, 1, 1) \)"
"4. \( (1, 0, 1, 1, 1) \)"
"5. \( (0, 0, 0, 2, 1) \)"
"Now, we can check how these combinations affect the possible values of \( m_2(r) \)."
### Case Analysis
1. **For \( m_1(1) = 3 \) and \( m_1(5) = 2 \)**:
"   - We need \( m_2(1) + m_2(5) \geq 1 \). Thus, \( m_2(1) \) can be \( 0 \) or \( 1 \) since \( m_1(1) \) already contributes significantly."
"   - This means \( m_2(2) + m_2(3) + m_2(4) = 1 \) and \( 2m_2(2) + 3m_2(3) + 4m_2(4) = 10 \). This is impossible since the maximum weighted sum with \( m_2(2), m_2(3), m_2(4) \) summing to 1 cannot reach 10."
2. **For \( m_1(3) = 1 \) and \( m_1(5) = 2 \)**:
"   - We need \( m_2(3) + m_2(5) \geq 1 \). Thus, \( m_2(5) \) can be \( 0 \) or \( 1 \)."
"   - This means \( m_2(1) + m_2(2) + m_2(4) = 3 \) and \( m_2(3) + 0 = 1 \), leading to \( m_2(1) + m_2(2) + m_2(4) = 3 \) and \( 0 + 2m_2(2) + 4m_2(4) = 15 \), which is impossible."
3. **For \( m_1(4) = 1 \) and \( m_1(5) = 1 \)**:
   - We need \( m_2(4) + m_2(5) \geq 1 \) and \( m_2(5) \) can be \( 0 \) or \( 1 \).
"   - This means \( m_2(1) + m_2(2) + m_2(3) = 3 \) and \( m_2(4) + 0 = 1 \) leading to \( m_2(1) + m_2(2) + m_2(3) = 3 \) and \( 0 + 2m_2(2) + 3m_2(3) + 4 = 12 \), which is also impossible."
4. **For \( m_1(1) = 4 \) and \( m_1(5) = 1 \)**:
"   - We need \( m_2(1) + m_2(5) \geq 1 \). Thus, \( m_2(1) \) can be \( 0 \) or \( 1 \)."
"   - This means \( m_2(2) + m_2(3) + m_2(4) = 0 \) and \( m_2(1) + 0 = 1 \), leading to \( m_2(1) + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 \) and \( 4m_2(1) + 5 = 16 \), which is impossible."
5. **For \( m_1(4) = 2 \) and \( m_1(5) = 1 \)**:
   - We need \( m_2(4) + m_2(5) \geq 1 \) and \( m_2(5) \) can be \( 0 \) or \( 1 \).
"   - This means \( m_2(1) + m_2(2) + m_2(3) = 2 \) and \( 0 + 0 + 0 + 4m_2(4) + 5 = 16 \), which is impossible."
### Summary of Valid Combinations
"After exploring the possible combinations, it appears that the only feasible multiplicities for the second quartic polynomial that meet both the total multiplicity and the weighted sum conditions are:"
"1. \( (0, 1, 1, 1, 1) \) → \( m_2(1) = 0, m_2(2) = 1, m_2(3) = 1, m_2(4) = 1, m_2(5) = 1 \)"
"2. \( (1, 0, 1, 1, 1) \) → \( m_2(1) = 1, m_2(2) = 0, m_2(3) = 1, m_2(4) = 1, m_2(5) = 1 \)"
"Now that we have the multiplicities for both factors, we can find \( P(6) \). Would you like to proceed with calculating \( P(6) \) using these multiplicities?"
Teacher: Let's take a moment to consolidate our findings so far before moving ahead.
"Remember, our polynomial is"
  P(x) = (2x⁴ − 26x³ + ax² + bx + c)(5x⁴ − 80x³ + dx² + ex + f).
"We established that the first quartic factor has roots chosen from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} with a total multiplicity of 4 and a weighted sum of 13. After exploring several possibilities, it turns out that the only viable option (so that every one of the five numbers appears at least once overall) is to assign for the first factor:"
"  m₁(1)=1, m₁(2)=0, m₁(3)=1, m₁(4)=1, m₁(5)=1."
This tells us that the first factor factors as
  2·(x − 1)(x − 3)(x − 4)(x − 5).
"For the second quartic factor, we require that its roots (again chosen from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}) have total multiplicity 4 and weighted sum 16. Working through the numbers, one possibility that meets the numerical conditions is:"
"  m₂(1)=0, m₂(2)=1, m₂(3)=0, m₂(4)=1, m₂(5)=2."
You should check that:
"  • The total multiplicity is 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4, and"
  • The weighted sum is 0·1 + 1·2 + 0·3 + 1·4 + 2·5 = 2 + 4 + 10 = 16.
"Also, when you combine these with the multiplicities from the first factor, every number in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} appears at least once overall. (For instance, even though m₂(1)=0 and m₂(3)=0, we already have these roots coming from the first factor.)"
This means the second factor factors as
  5·(x − 2)(x − 4)(x − 5)².
"Now, here is your next step:"
1. Write down the complete factored form of P(x) using the valid multiplicity assignments we identified.
2. Then express P(6) in terms of these factors.
"Please work on writing the factored form of P(x) and the corresponding expression for P(6). Share your work, and we can check it before moving on further."
"Student: To express the polynomial \( P(x) \) in its complete factored form, we can combine the factors from both quartic polynomials based on the multiplicities we've determined."
### Factored Form of \( P(x) \)
1. **First Quartic Factor**:
   - The multiplicities we found are:
     - \( m_1(1) = 1 \)
     - \( m_1(2) = 0 \)
     - \( m_1(3) = 1 \)
     - \( m_1(4) = 1 \)
     - \( m_1(5) = 1 \)
"   - Thus, the first factor is:"
   \[
   2(x - 1)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)
   \]
2. **Second Quartic Factor**:
   - The multiplicities are:
     - \( m_2(1) = 0 \)
     - \( m_2(2) = 1 \)
     - \( m_2(3) = 0 \)
     - \( m_2(4) = 1 \)
     - \( m_2(5) = 2 \)
"   - Thus, the second factor is:"
   \[
   5(x - 2)(x - 4)(x - 5)^2
   \]
### Complete Factored Form of \( P(x) \)
"Combining these factors, we have:"
\[
P(x) = 2(x - 1)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5) \cdot 5(x - 2)(x - 4)(x - 5)^2
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
P(x) = 10(x - 1)(x - 3)(x - 2)(x - 4)^2(x - 5)^3
\]
### Evaluating \( P(6) \)
Now we can evaluate \( P(6) \):
\[
P(6) = 10(6 - 1)(6 - 3)(6 - 2)(6 - 4)^2(6 - 5)^3
\]
Calculating each term:
- \( 6 - 1 = 5 \)
- \( 6 - 3 = 3 \)
- \( 6 - 2 = 4 \)
- \( 6 - 4 = 2 \)
- \( 6 - 5 = 1 \)
Now substituting these values into the expression:
\[
P(6) = 10 \cdot 5 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (2^2) \cdot (1^3)
\]
\[
= 10 \cdot 5 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 1
\]
Calculating step-by-step:
- \( 5 \cdot 3 = 15 \)
- \( 15 \cdot 4 = 60 \)
- \( 60 \cdot 4 = 240 \)
- \( 240 \cdot 10 = 2400 \)
"Thus, we find:"
\[
P(6) = 2400
\]
### Final Answer
"Therefore, the value of \( P(6) \) is \( \boxed{2400} \)."
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly written P(x) in its complete factored form as
  P(x) = 10(x – 1)(x – 2)(x – 3)(x – 4)²(x – 5)³
and then evaluated P(6) as
  P(6) = 10 · (6 – 1) · (6 – 2) · (6 – 3) · (6 – 4)² · (6 – 5)³  
      = 10 · 5 · 4 · 3 · (2²) · 1  
      = 2400
Great job carefully finding and checking the multiplicities and then combining the factors to compute P(6). 
2400$
