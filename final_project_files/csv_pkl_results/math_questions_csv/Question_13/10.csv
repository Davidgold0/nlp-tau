"Question: Let \[P(x) = (2x^4 - 26x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c)(5x^4 - 80x^3 + dx^2 + ex + f),\]where $a, b, c, d, e, f$ are real numbers. Suppose that the set of all complex roots of $P(x)$ is $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}.$ Find $P(6).$"
3o-mini: We are given
"  P(x) = [2x⁴ – 26x³ + a x² + b x + c] · [5x⁴ – 80x³ + d x² + e x + f],"
"where a, b, c, d, e, f are real numbers, and we know that the set of all complex roots of P(x) is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. (That is, every complex root of P(x) is one of these five numbers, though some may occur with multiplicity.) Since each factor is a quartic, the product P(x) is an 8th–degree polynomial. Hence the eight roots (counted with multiplicity) must be chosen from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}."
"A useful idea is to “split” P(x) into its two factors. One factor, call it Q(x) = 2x⁴ – 26x³ + …, has four roots; and the other, call it R(x) = 5x⁴ – 80x³ + …, has four roots. Although the overall set of roots is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, some numbers must appear in both factors. (Also, each number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 must appear at least once as a root of P(x).)"
Step 1. Find the Sums of the Roots in Each Factor
Recall that if a polynomial is written as
"  a x⁴ + b x³ + …,"
then the sum of its roots is –(b/a).
"For Q(x) = 2x⁴ – 26x³ + …, the sum of its four roots is"
  –(–26)/2 = 13.
"For R(x) = 5x⁴ – 80x³ + …, the sum of its four roots is"
  –(–80)/5 = 16.
Step 2. Propose a Distribution of Roots
"We want to assign, to Q(x) and R(x), multisets of four numbers chosen from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} whose sums are 13 and 16, respectively, and such that every number from 1 to 5 appears (at least once in one or the other factor)."
A good way to “guess” a valid distribution is to try to split the numbers so that the total sum of roots in P(x) (which is 13 + 16 = 29) is the weighted sum
"  1·m₁ + 2·m₂ + 3·m₃ + 4·m₄ + 5·m₅ = 29,"
"where mₖ denotes the total multiplicity of the number k as a root of P(x). Since P(x) is degree 8 and there are 5 distinct numbers, the multiplicities m₁,…, m₅ are positive integers that add to 8. (Hence three “extra” roots appear in addition to having each number appear once.)"
One working possibility is to have the overall multiplicities:
"  1 appears once,"
"  2 appears once,"
"  3 appears once,"
"  4 appears twice,"
  5 appears three times.
"Indeed, 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 8 and the weighted sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 8 + 15 = 29."
"Now, we need to “split” these between Q(x) and R(x) so that the sums match 13 and 16. One way to do this is to take:"
"• For Q(x) (sum = 13): Choose the roots 1, 3, 4, and 5."
  Their sum: 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 13.
  So Q(x) factors as 2·(x – 1)(x – 3)(x – 4)(x – 5).
"• For R(x) (sum = 16): Then the remaining occurrences must supply the other multiplicities. Notice that overall 2 appears once but it did not appear as a root of Q(x); hence 2 must be a root of R(x). Also, 4 must appear one more time (because 4 appears twice overall but Q(x) already supplies one copy) and 5 must appear two more times (since 5 appears three times overall and Q(x) gives one copy). For R(x) we now have roots:"
"  2 (once), 4 (once), and 5 (twice)."
  Their sum: 2 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 16.
  Thus R(x) factors as 5·(x – 2)(x – 4)(x – 5)².
"This splitting meets all the requirements: every number in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} appears at least once, the totals of the roots in Q(x) and R(x) are 13 and 16 respectively, and the total degree is 8."
Step 3. Write Down the Factors Explicitly and Compute P(6)
With the above choices we can write
  Q(x) = 2·(x – 1)(x – 3)(x – 4)(x – 5)
  R(x) = 5·(x – 2)(x – 4)(x – 5)².
Then
  P(x) = Q(x) · R(x).
Now compute Q(6) and R(6):
For Q(6):
  Q(6) = 2·(6 – 1)(6 – 3)(6 – 4)(6 – 5)
      = 2 · (5) · (3) · (2) · (1)
      = 2 · 30 = 60.
For R(6):
  R(6) = 5·(6 – 2)(6 – 4)[(6 – 5)²]
      = 5 · (4) · (2) · (1²)
      = 5 · 8 = 40.
"Thus,"
  P(6) = Q(6) · R(6) = 60 · 40 = 2400.
Answer: 2400.
