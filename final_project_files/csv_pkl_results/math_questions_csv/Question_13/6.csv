"Question: Let \[P(x) = (2x^4 - 26x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c)(5x^4 - 80x^3 + dx^2 + ex + f),\]where $a, b, c, d, e, f$ are real numbers. Suppose that the set of all complex roots of $P(x)$ is $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}.$ Find $P(6).$"
3o-mini: We are given
  P(x) = (2x⁴ – 26x³ + a x² + b x + c)(5x⁴ – 80x³ + d x² + e x + f)
"and we know that the set of all complex roots of P(x) is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Although P(x) is an 8th–degree polynomial (the product of two quartics), it has only five distinct roots. Thus some of these numbers must appear with multiplicity so that the total number of (not necessarily distinct) roots is 8."
Step 1. Write P(x) in “root–factorized form.”
"Since the leading coefficient from multiplication is 2 · 5 = 10, we write"
"  P(x) = 10 (x – 1)^(m₁) (x – 2)^(m₂) (x – 3)^(m₃) (x – 4)^(m₄) (x – 5)^(m₅),"
"where m₁, m₂, m₃, m₄, m₅ are positive integers (since each 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is a root) that satisfy"
  m₁ + m₂ + m₃ + m₄ + m₅ = 8.
Step 2. Use the x⁷–term (sum of the roots).
"When we multiply out P(x), the coefficient of x⁸ is 10 and the x⁷–coefficient is –10 (sum of roots counted with multiplicity). On the other hand, we can compute the x⁷–term by multiplying the x⁴–term from one factor by the x³–term from the other:"
  (2x⁴)(–80x³) + (–26x³)(5x⁴) = –160x⁷ – 130x⁷ = –290x⁷.
Thus the overall x⁷–coefficient is –290. In our root–form the x⁷–coefficient is –10 (sum of the roots); so
  –10 (m₁·1 + m₂·2 + m₃·3 + m₄·4 + m₅·5) = –290
  ⇒ m₁ + 2m₂ + 3m₃ + 4m₄ + 5m₅ = 29.
Step 3. Find the multiplicities.
We have the system:
  m₁ + m₂ + m₃ + m₄ + m₅ = 8      (1)
  1·m₁ + 2·m₂ + 3·m₃ + 4·m₄ + 5·m₅ = 29  (2)
with each mᵢ ≥ 1.
"Write mᵢ = 1 + nᵢ, where each nᵢ is a nonnegative integer. Then (1) becomes"
"  (n₁ + n₂ + n₃ + n₄ + n₅) + 5 = 8  ⇒ n₁ + n₂ + n₃ + n₄ + n₅ = 3,"
and (2) becomes
"  (1+n₁) + 2(1+n₂) + 3(1+n₃) + 4(1+n₄) + 5(1+n₅) = 29,"
"i.e.,"
  15 + (n₁ + 2n₂ + 3n₃ + 4n₄ + 5n₅) = 29  ⇒ n₁ + 2n₂ + 3n₃ + 4n₄ + 5n₅ = 14.
"One way to achieve this is to “pack” the extra 3 units into the higher–weighted roots. For instance, take"
"  n₁ = 0, n₂ = 0, n₃ = 0, n₄ = 1, n₅ = 2."
Then the multiplicities are
"  m₁ = 1, m₂ = 1, m₃ = 1, m₄ = 2, m₅ = 3."
A quick check:
"  Sum of multiplicities: 1+1+1+2+3 = 8,"
  Weighted sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 8 + 15 = 29.
(There are several possible distributions; the key is that P(x) factors as stated and our answer will be independent of how these multiplicities come from partitioning between the two quartic factors.)
Step 4. Compute P(6).
Since P(x) factors as
"  P(x) = 10 (x – 1)¹ (x – 2)¹ (x – 3)¹ (x – 4)² (x – 5)³,"
we substitute x = 6:
  P(6) = 10 (6 – 1) (6 – 2) (6 – 3) (6 – 4)² (6 – 5)³.
Calculate each factor:
"  6 – 1 = 5,"
"  6 – 2 = 4,"
"  6 – 3 = 3,"
"  6 – 4 = 2  (so (6 – 4)² = 2² = 4),"
  6 – 5 = 1  (so (6 – 5)³ = 1³ = 1).
"Thus,"
  P(6) = 10 · 5 · 4 · 3 · 4 · 1 = 10 · (5·4·3·4).
Compute inside:
"  5 × 4 = 20,"
"  20 × 3 = 60,"
  60 × 4 = 240.
"Finally,"
  P(6) = 10 × 240 = 2400.
So the answer is 2400.
