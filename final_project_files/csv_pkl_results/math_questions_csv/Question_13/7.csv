"Question: Let \[P(x) = (2x^4 - 26x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c)(5x^4 - 80x^3 + dx^2 + ex + f),\]where $a, b, c, d, e, f$ are real numbers. Suppose that the set of all complex roots of $P(x)$ is $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}.$ Find $P(6).$"
3o-mini: We are given
"  P(x) = [2x⁴ – 26x³ + a·x² + b·x + c] · [5x⁴ – 80x³ + d·x² + e·x + f],"
"and we know that the set of all complex roots of P(x) (with multiplicity) is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Since P(x) is the product of two quartics, it is degree 8, so the eight roots (counted with multiplicity) must be some distribution among the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5."
An outline of the solution is as follows:
1. Use the form of the two quartics to deduce the sums of the roots (by Vieta’s formulas).
"2. “Split” the eight roots between the two factors (each quartic gives 4 roots) so that overall the roots (with multiplicities) are among 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."
3. Choose multiplicities that match the given coefficients in the x³‐terms.
4. Write down explicit factorizations for the two quartics.
5. Compute P(6).
Step 1. Using Vieta’s formulas:
"• For the first factor, Q₁(x) = 2x⁴ – 26x³ + …, the sum of its four roots is (26/2) = 13."
"• For the second factor, Q₂(x) = 5x⁴ – 80x³ + …, the sum of its four roots is (80/5) = 16."
"So if the roots of Q₁ are r₁, r₂, r₃, r₄ then r₁ + r₂ + r₃ + r₄ = 13, and if the roots of Q₂ are s₁, s₂, s₃, s₄ then s₁ + s₂ + s₃ + s₄ = 16."
"Step 2. Our eight roots (with multiplicity) must come from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and also satisfy"
  (total sum) = 13 + 16 = 29.
"That is,"
"  (1 · m₁) + (2 · m₂) + (3 · m₃) + (4 · m₄) + (5 · m₅) = 29,"
"with m₁ + m₂ + m₃ + m₄ + m₅ = 8, where mᵢ is the total multiplicity of the root i."
"Step 3. We now need to “split” the eight roots into two groups of four (one group for Q₁ and one for Q₂) whose sums are 13 and 16 respectively, with the numbers coming only from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. One possible way is as follows."
"For Q₁ (sum = 13): Notice that 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 13. Thus we may take Q₁ to have roots 1, 3, 4, and 5 (each with multiplicity 1)."
"For Q₂ (sum = 16): We then need four numbers (with repetition allowed from {1,2,3,4,5}) that sum to 16. One possibility is to take the roots 1, 5, 5, and 5, since 1 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 16."
Check overall multiplicities: 
"– The root 1 appears in Q₁ and Q₂, so overall its multiplicity is 1 + 1 = 2."
– The root 3 appears only in Q₁ (multiplicity 1).
– The root 4 appears only in Q₁ (multiplicity 1).
– The root 5 appears in both factors (1 from Q₁ and 3 from Q₂) so overall its multiplicity is 1 + 3 = 4.
– The root 2 does not appear in either factor (multiplicity 0).
Then the total multiplicity is 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 8 and the weighted sum is
"  (1×2) + (2×0) + (3×1) + (4×1) + (5×4) = 2 + 0 + 3 + 4 + 20 = 29,"
which is exactly what we need.
Step 4. Writing the factors:
"Since Q₁ has roots 1, 3, 4, 5 and leading coefficient 2, we write"
  Q₁(x) = 2·(x – 1)(x – 3)(x – 4)(x – 5).
"Similarly, Q₂ has roots 1, 5 (with multiplicity 3) and leading coefficient 5, so"
  Q₂(x) = 5·(x – 1)(x – 5)³.
"Thus, the polynomial becomes"
  P(x) = Q₁(x) · Q₂(x)
      = [2·(x – 1)(x – 3)(x – 4)(x – 5)] · [5·(x – 1)(x – 5)³]
      = 10·(x – 1)² · (x – 3) · (x – 4) · (x – 5)⁴.
"Step 5. Finally, we compute P(6):"
  P(6) = 10 · (6 – 1)² · (6 – 3) · (6 – 4) · (6 – 5)⁴
     = 10 · (5²) · (3) · (2) · (1⁴)
     = 10 · 25 · 3 · 2 · 1
     = 10 · 150
     = 1500.
"Therefore, the value of P(6) is 1500."
