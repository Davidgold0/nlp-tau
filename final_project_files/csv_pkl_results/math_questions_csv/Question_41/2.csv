"Question: Nancy generates a two-digit integer by rolling a six-sided die twice. The result of her first roll is the tens digit, and the result of her second roll is the ones digit. What is the probability that the resulting integer is divisible by 8? Express your answer as a common fraction."
"Teacher: Let's begin by understanding what the problem is asking. Nancy rolls a six‐sided die twice. The first roll gives the tens digit and the second roll gives the ones digit, forming a two-digit number. Our goal is to find the probability that this number is divisible by 8."
"To tackle this problem, here are the steps we can follow:"
"1. First, determine the total number of possible two-digit numbers that can be generated with these dice rolls."
"2. Next, figure out which of these numbers are divisible by 8."
3. Count the favorable outcomes (numbers divisible by 8) and then form the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes.
"4. Finally, simplify this ratio to express it as a common fraction."
"Let’s start with step 1. Can you tell me what the total number of outcomes is for the two dice rolls? (Remember, the first roll determines the tens digit and the second roll determines the ones digit.)"
"Student: To find the total number of possible two-digit numbers that can be generated by rolling the die twice, we can think about the outcomes of each roll."
1. **First Roll (Tens Digit)**: There are 6 possible outcomes (1 through 6).
2. **Second Roll (Ones Digit)**: There are also 6 possible outcomes (1 through 6).
"Since each roll is independent, we can multiply the number of outcomes from each roll to get the total number of two-digit combinations:"
Total outcomes = (number of outcomes for the first roll) × (number of outcomes for the second roll)  
Total outcomes = 6 × 6 = 36.
"So, there are 36 possible two-digit numbers that can be generated. "
Is that correct? What should we do next?
Teacher: Great job! You've correctly determined that there are 36 total outcomes in step 1.
"Now let's move to step 2: We need to identify which of these two-digit numbers are divisible by 8. A useful approach is to consider the numbers grouped by their tens digit. For example, start with the numbers where the tens digit is 1 (i.e., 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16). Can you check these numbers and tell me which of them are divisible by 8? Please take it one group at a time."
Student: Student: Sure! Let's start with the numbers where the tens digit is 1. The possible two-digit numbers are:
- 11
- 12
- 13
- 14
- 15
- 16
"Now, let's check which of these numbers are divisible by 8:"
- **11 ÷ 8** = 1.375 (not divisible)
- **12 ÷ 8** = 1.5 (not divisible)
- **13 ÷ 8** = 1.625 (not divisible)
- **14 ÷ 8** = 1.75 (not divisible)
- **15 ÷ 8** = 1.875 (not divisible)
- **16 ÷ 8** = 2 (divisible)
"So, from this group, only **16** is divisible by 8. "
What should I do next? Should I move on to the next group of numbers where the tens digit is 2?
"Teacher: Great work on the first group! Now, let's proceed to the next group where the tens digit is 2, meaning the numbers are 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26."
"Could you please check each of these numbers to determine which ones are divisible by 8? Let's take it one step at a time again—list the numbers you find and show your reasoning, then let me know which ones are divisible by 8."
Student: Student: Okay! Let's look at the numbers where the tens digit is 2. The possible two-digit numbers are:
- 21
- 22

- **46 ÷ 8** = 5.75 (not divisible)
"From this group, none of the numbers are divisible by 8."
Should I proceed to the next group where the tens digit is 5?
"Teacher: Great job so far! Now let's move on to the next group where the tens digit is 5. That means we're looking at the numbers 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, and 56. Could you please check each of these numbers to see if they are divisible by 8? Go one by one, show your reasoning, and let me know which numbers work."

- **52 ÷ 8** = 6.5 (not divisible)
- **53 ÷ 8** = 6.625 (not divisible)
- **54 ÷ 8** = 6.75 (not divisible)
- **55 ÷ 8** = 6.875 (not divisible)
- **56 ÷ 8** = 7 (divisible)
"From this group, only **56** is divisible by 8."
Should I move on to the last group where the tens digit is 6?
"Teacher: You're doing fantastic! Yes, please move on to the final group with tens digit 6. That means you should look at the numbers: 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, and 66. "
"For each number, please check whether it's divisible by 8 (remember to reason through each division), then let me know which ones are divisible by 8. What do you find?"

"Now, I will check each of these numbers for divisibility by 8:"
- **61 ÷ 8** = 7.625 (not divisible)
- **62 ÷ 8** = 7.75 (not divisible)
- **63 ÷ 8** = 7.875 (not divisible)
- **64 ÷ 8** = 8 (divisible)
- **65 ÷ 8** = 8.125 (not divisible)

"From this group, only **64** is divisible by 8."
"Now that we've gone through all the groups, let's summarize the numbers we found that are divisible by 8:"
- From the tens digit 1: **16**
- From the tens digit 2: **24**
- From the tens digit 3: **32**
- From the tens digit 4: none
- From the tens digit 5: **56**
- From the tens digit 6: **64**
"So, the numbers divisible by 8 are: **16, 24, 32, 56, and 64**."
"Next, should I count the total favorable outcomes and then calculate the probability?"
"Teacher: Excellent work summarizing the divisible numbers! Now that we've identified the numbers divisible by 8 (16, 24, 32, 56, and 64), our next step is to count these favorable outcomes and then calculate the probability."
Can you please count the total number of favorable outcomes and then determine the probability of generating a number divisible by 8 by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes (which is 36)? Take your time and show your work for this step.
Student: Student: Sure! Let's count the favorable outcomes we found earlier. The numbers that are divisible by 8 are:
- **16**
- **24**
- **32**
- **56**
- **64**
"So, there are a total of **5 favorable outcomes**."
"Now, we know from earlier that the total number of possible outcomes is **36**. "
"To find the probability that a randomly generated two-digit number is divisible by 8, we can use the formula:"
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{5}{36}
\]
"Thus, the probability that the resulting integer is divisible by 8 is \(\frac{5}{36}\)."
Is there anything else you would like me to do?
"Teacher: Great job! You've correctly figured out that the favorable outcomes are the numbers 16, 24, 32, 56, and 64, and since there are 36 possible outcomes, the probability of getting a number divisible by 8 is 5/36. "
5/36$
