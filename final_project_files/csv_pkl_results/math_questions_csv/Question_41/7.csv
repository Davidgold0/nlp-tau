"Question: Nancy generates a two-digit integer by rolling a six-sided die twice. The result of her first roll is the tens digit, and the result of her second roll is the ones digit. What is the probability that the resulting integer is divisible by 8? Express your answer as a common fraction."
"3o-mini: Since both the tens digit and ones digit come from a 6-sided die, each digit can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. This gives a total of 6 × 6 = 36 possible two-digit numbers."
"A number is divisible by 8 if it is one of the multiples of 8. In the range of two-digit numbers that can be generated (with tens digit 1–6 and ones digit 1–6), the multiples of 8 are: "
• 16  
• 24  
• 32  
• 56  
• 64  
"Each of these numbers has digits that are within the 1–6 range. Therefore, there are 5 favorable outcomes."
"Thus, the probability is 5/36."
