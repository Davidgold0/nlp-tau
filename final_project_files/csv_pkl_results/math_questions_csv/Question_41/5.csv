"Question: Nancy generates a two-digit integer by rolling a six-sided die twice. The result of her first roll is the tens digit, and the result of her second roll is the ones digit. What is the probability that the resulting integer is divisible by 8? Express your answer as a common fraction."
Teacher: Let's start by outlining the approach:
1. Determine the total number of possible two-digit numbers Nancy could generate by rolling the die twice.
2. Identify which of these numbers are divisible by 8.
3. Count the favorable outcomes (where the number is divisible by 8) and then compute the probability as (favorable outcomes) ÷ (total outcomes).
"For now, please work on the first step: find the total number of possible outcomes when Nancy rolls the six-sided die twice. What is your answer for this step?"
"Student: To find the total number of possible outcomes when Nancy rolls the six-sided die twice, we can consider the following:"
"1. For the first roll, which represents the tens digit, Nancy can roll any number from 1 to 6. This gives us 6 possible outcomes."
"2. For the second roll, which represents the ones digit, she can also roll any number from 1 to 6. This again gives us 6 possible outcomes."
"Since the rolls are independent, we can multiply the number of outcomes from each roll to find the total number of two-digit integers she can generate:"
Total outcomes = (outcomes from first roll) × (outcomes from second roll) = 6 × 6 = 36.
"So, the total number of possible two-digit numbers Nancy could generate is 36."
Teacher: Great job! You correctly determined that there are 36 possible outcomes.
Now let's move on to the next step. We need to identify the two-digit numbers that Nancy can generate (using digits 1 through 6 for both tens and ones place) that are divisible by 8.
"Before you list them, here's a hint: A number is divisible by 8 if the entire number (since it's only two digits in this case) is a multiple of 8. Can you list the numbers, from the ones available (remember, only numbers formed from digits 1 to 6), that are divisible by 8? Please show your work for your list."
"Student: To find the two-digit numbers that Nancy can generate and that are divisible by 8, we need to consider all the combinations of the tens and ones digits formed by rolling the die. The tens digit can be any number from 1 to 6, and the ones digit can also be any number from 1 to 6. "
"First, let's list all the possible two-digit combinations:"
"- For tens digit 1: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16"
"- For tens digit 2: 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26"
"- For tens digit 3: 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36"
"- For tens digit 4: 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46"
"- For tens digit 5: 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56"
"- For tens digit 6: 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66"
"Now, we need to check which of these numbers are divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if the last three digits of the number form a number that is divisible by 8. Since we are dealing with two-digit numbers, we can check each number directly."
"Now, let's check the divisibility for each number:"
- 11 ÷ 8 = 1.375 (not divisible)
- 12 ÷ 8 = 1.5 (not divisible)
- 13 ÷ 8 = 1.625 (not divisible)
- 14 ÷ 8 = 1.75 (not divisible)
- 15 ÷ 8 = 1.875 (not divisible)
- 16 ÷ 8 = 2 (divisible)
- 21 ÷ 8 = 2.625 (not divisible)
- 22 ÷ 8 = 2.75 (not divisible)
- 23 ÷ 8 = 2.875 (not divisible)
- 24 ÷ 8 = 3 (divisible)
- 25 ÷ 8 = 3.125 (not divisible)
- 26 ÷ 8 = 3.25 (not divisible)
- 31 ÷ 8 = 3.875 (not divisible)
- 32 ÷ 8 = 4 (divisible)
- 33 ÷ 8 = 4.125 (not divisible)
- 34 ÷ 8 = 4.25 (not divisible)
- 35 ÷ 8 = 4.375 (not divisible)
- 36 ÷ 8 = 4.5 (not divisible)
- 41 ÷ 8 = 5.125 (not divisible)
- 42 ÷ 8 = 5.25 (not divisible)
- 43 ÷ 8 = 5.375 (not divisible)
- 44 ÷ 8 = 5.5 (not divisible)
- 45 ÷ 8 = 5.625 (not divisible)
- 46 ÷ 8 = 5.75 (not divisible)
- 51 ÷ 8 = 6.375 (not divisible)
- 52 ÷ 8 = 6.5 (not divisible)
- 53 ÷ 8 = 6.625 (not divisible)
- 54 ÷ 8 = 6.75 (not divisible)
- 55 ÷ 8 = 6.875 (not divisible)
- 56 ÷ 8 = 7 (divisible)
- 61 ÷ 8 = 7.625 (not divisible)
- 62 ÷ 8 = 7.75 (not divisible)
- 63 ÷ 8 = 7.875 (not divisible)
- 64 ÷ 8 = 8 (divisible)
- 65 ÷ 8 = 8.125 (not divisible)
- 66 ÷ 8 = 8.25 (not divisible)
"Now, summarizing the numbers that are divisible by 8, we have:"
- 16
- 24
- 32
- 56
- 64
"So, the two-digit numbers that Nancy can generate and that are divisible by 8 are: 16, 24, 32, 56, and 64."
"Next, we will count these favorable outcomes. How many numbers did we find that are divisible by 8?"
"Teacher: You've correctly identified the numbers that are divisible by 8: 16, 24, 32, 56, and 64. Now, please count these favorable outcomes. How many numbers are there in your list?"
Student: There are 5 numbers in my list that are divisible by 8: 
1. 16
2. 24
3. 32
4. 56
5. 64
"So, the count of favorable outcomes is 5."
Teacher: That's correct! You have 5 favorable outcomes.
"Now, let's move to the final step. To find the probability that the resulting number is divisible by 8, we need to set up the fraction with the number of favorable outcomes as the numerator and the total number of outcomes (36) as the denominator."
Can you now calculate this probability as a common fraction? Please show your reasoning.
"Student: To calculate the probability that the resulting two-digit number generated by Nancy is divisible by 8, we will use the information we have gathered:"
"1. **Number of favorable outcomes (divisible by 8)**: 5 (the numbers are 16, 24, 32, 56, and 64)."
2. **Total number of possible outcomes**: 36.
Now we can set up the probability as follows:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{5}{36}
\]
"Thus, the probability that the resulting integer is divisible by 8 is \(\frac{5}{36}\)."
"Teacher: Excellent work! You've carefully determined that there are 36 possible outcomes and identified 5 favorable outcomes (namely, 16, 24, 32, 56, and 64) that are divisible by 8. Setting up the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes gives us:"
Probability = 5/36
This is the final answer: 5/36$
