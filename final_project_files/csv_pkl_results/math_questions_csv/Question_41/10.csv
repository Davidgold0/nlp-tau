"Question: Nancy generates a two-digit integer by rolling a six-sided die twice. The result of her first roll is the tens digit, and the result of her second roll is the ones digit. What is the probability that the resulting integer is divisible by 8? Express your answer as a common fraction."
"3o-mini: Nancy generates a two‐digit integer where the tens digit can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 and the ones digit can also be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, making 6 × 6 = 36 equally likely outcomes."
"To find the probability that the integer is divisible by 8, we first list the multiples of 8 that fall in the two-digit range and check for validity with our digit restrictions:"
• 16 (1 and 6) – Valid  
• 24 (2 and 4) – Valid  
• 32 (3 and 2) – Valid  
• 40 (4 and 0) – Not valid (0 isn’t possible)  
• 48 (4 and 8) – Not valid (8 isn’t possible)  
• 56 (5 and 6) – Valid  
• 64 (6 and 4) – Valid
"There are 5 valid numbers (16, 24, 32, 56, 64) out of 36 total outcomes. Thus, the probability is 5/36."
