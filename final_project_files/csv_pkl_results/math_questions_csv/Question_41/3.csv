"Question: Nancy generates a two-digit integer by rolling a six-sided die twice. The result of her first roll is the tens digit, and the result of her second roll is the ones digit. What is the probability that the resulting integer is divisible by 8? Express your answer as a common fraction."
Teacher: Let's begin by ensuring we clearly understand the problem.
"Nancy rolls a six-sided die twice: the first roll gives the tens digit and the second roll the ones digit. This means that every possible two-digit number can be represented as an ordered pair (tens, ones), with each digit coming from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}."
"To solve the problem, here are the steps we need to follow:"
1. Determine the total number of two-digit numbers Nancy can generate.
2. Identify which of these numbers are divisible by 8.
3. Count the favorable outcomes.
"4. Compute the probability as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total outcomes, and express it as a common fraction."
Let's start with the very first step:
Please determine the total number of two-digit numbers that can be generated by rolling the die twice (remember: the first roll is the tens digit and the second roll is the ones digit). What do you come up with for the total number of outcomes?
"Student: To determine the total number of two-digit numbers that Nancy can generate by rolling a six-sided die twice, we need to consider the possible outcomes for each roll:"
"1. The first roll gives us the tens digit, which can be any number from 1 to 6 (since the die has six sides)."
"2. The second roll gives us the ones digit, which can also be any number from 1 to 6."
"Since both rolls are independent, we can find the total number of outcomes by multiplying the number of options for each roll:"
"- For the tens digit: 6 options (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)"
"- For the ones digit: 6 options (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)"
"So, the total number of two-digit numbers is:"
\[
6 \times 6 = 36
\]
"Therefore, there are 36 possible two-digit numbers that Nancy can generate. Would you like me to proceed to the next step?"
Teacher: Great job! You've correctly determined that there are 36 possible two-digit numbers.
"Now, let's move on to the next step:"
Step 2: We need to identify which of these two-digit numbers (formed by the digits from 1 to 6 for both tens and ones) are divisible by 8. A helpful approach is to consider each possible number and test for divisibility by 8 by performing division or checking if the number modulo 8 is zero.
Please list or describe your process for finding the numbers among these 36 that are divisible by 8. What is your plan for tackling this step?
"Student: To find out which of the two-digit numbers formed by Nancy's rolls are divisible by 8, I will follow these steps:"
"1. **List All Possible Two-Digit Numbers**: Since the tens digit can be any number from 1 to 6 and the ones digit can also be any number from 1 to 6, I will generate all possible combinations of these digits."
"2. **Check Each Number for Divisibility by 8**: For each number I generate, I will check if it is divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if the last three digits of the number (in this case, the entire two-digit number since they are less than 100) is divisible by 8."
Here are the possible two-digit numbers formed by the rolls:
"- Tens digit = 1: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16"
"- Tens digit = 2: 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26"
"- Tens digit = 3: 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36"
"- Tens digit = 4: 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46"
"- Tens digit = 5: 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56"
"- Tens digit = 6: 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66"
"Next, I will check each of these numbers for divisibility by 8:"
- **11**: Not divisible
- **12**: Not divisible
- **13**: Not divisible
- **14**: Not divisible
- **15**: Not divisible
- **16**: Divisible (16 ÷ 8 = 2)
- **21**: Not divisible
- **22**: Not divisible
- **23**: Not divisible
- **24**: Divisible (24 ÷ 8 = 3)
- **25**: Not divisible
- **26**: Not divisible
- **31**: Not divisible
- **32**: Divisible (32 ÷ 8 = 4)
- **33**: Not divisible
- **34**: Not divisible
- **35**: Not divisible
- **36**: Not divisible
- **41**: Not divisible
- **42**: Not divisible
- **43**: Not divisible
- **44**: Not divisible
- **45**: Not divisible
- **46**: Not divisible
- **51**: Not divisible
- **52**: Not divisible
- **53**: Not divisible
- **54**: Not divisible
- **55**: Not divisible
- **56**: Divisible (56 ÷ 8 = 7)
- **61**: Not divisible
- **62**: Not divisible
- **63**: Not divisible
- **64**: Divisible (64 ÷ 8 = 8)
- **65**: Not divisible
- **66**: Not divisible
"Now, I will summarize the numbers that are divisible by 8: "
- 16
- 24
- 32
- 56
- 64
"So, there are **5** favorable outcomes that are divisible by 8. "
Would you like me to proceed to the next step of calculating the probability?
"Teacher: That's a clear and thorough explanation! You've successfully listed all possible two-digit numbers and determined which ones are divisible by 8. Now that you have identified 5 favorable outcomes (16, 24, 32, 56, and 64) out of the total 36 possible outcomes, it's time to compute the probability."
Please calculate the probability as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total outcomes and express your answer as a common fraction. What do you get?
"Student: To calculate the probability that the resulting two-digit integer is divisible by 8, I will use the formula:"
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}}
\]
We have determined:
"- Number of favorable outcomes (divisible by 8): 5 (which are 16, 24, 32, 56, and 64)"
- Total outcomes: 36
"Now, substituting these values into the formula:"
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{5}{36}
\]
"Thus, the probability that the resulting integer is divisible by 8 is "
\[
\frac{5}{36}
\]
Would you like me to reflect on this solution or clarify anything further?
"Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly calculated the probability as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which gives you 5/36."
Final answer: 5/36$
