"Question: Nancy generates a two-digit integer by rolling a six-sided die twice. The result of her first roll is the tens digit, and the result of her second roll is the ones digit. What is the probability that the resulting integer is divisible by 8? Express your answer as a common fraction."
"Teacher: Let's start by breaking this problem down into manageable steps. First, we need to determine how many total two-digit numbers Nancy could potentially generate by rolling a six-sided die twice. "
Step 1: Find the total number of outcomes. 
(Remember that each roll of a six-sided die gives 6 possibilities and the first roll gives the tens digit while the second gives the ones digit.) 
Could you calculate the total number of possible outcomes from these two rolls?
"Student: Sure! Since Nancy rolls a six-sided die twice, we can calculate the total number of outcomes by multiplying the number of possibilities for each roll."
"For the first roll (tens digit), there are 6 possible outcomes (1 through 6). For the second roll (ones digit), there are also 6 possible outcomes (1 through 6)."
"So, the total number of outcomes is:"
\[ 
6 \text{ (for the first roll)} \times 6 \text{ (for the second roll)} = 36 
\]
"Therefore, there are 36 possible two-digit integers that Nancy could generate. "
What should we do next?
Teacher: Good job! You correctly determined that there are 36 total outcomes.
"Step 2: Now we need to count how many of these two-digit numbers are divisible by 8. Remember, Nancy's two-digit number has the tens digit from the first roll (1–6) and the ones digit from the second roll (1–6). "
"To proceed, please work on identifying each outcome that creates a number divisible by 8. "
"Hint: Consider the divisibility rule for 8; a number is divisible by 8 if the last three digits (or in this case, the entire two-digit number) form a number that is divisible by 8. List out the numbers from the possible outcomes (where both digits are between 1 and 6) that satisfy this condition."
Could you list those favorable outcomes (or count them) and explain your reasoning for each?
"Student: Sure! To find the two-digit numbers that Nancy can generate and check which of them are divisible by 8, I will list out all the possible combinations of outcomes from the two rolls."
"The two-digit number is formed by combining the tens digit (from the first roll) and the ones digit (from the second roll). The tens digit can be any number from 1 to 6, and the ones digit can also be any number from 1 to 6. This gives us the following combinations:"
"- For tens digit 1: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16"
"- For tens digit 2: 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26"
"- For tens digit 3: 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36"
"- For tens digit 4: 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46"
"- For tens digit 5: 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56"
"- For tens digit 6: 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66"
"Now, I will check each of these two-digit numbers to see if they are divisible by 8:"

3. **13**: Not divisible by 8.

"Now, let's count the numbers that are divisible by 8:"
- 16
- 24
- 32
- 44
- 52
- 56
- 64
There are 7 favorable outcomes that are divisible by 8.
What should I do next?
"Teacher: Great effort in listing out all the possibilities! However, let's carefully check which of the two-digit numbers are actually divisible by 8. Remember, a number is divisible by 8 if, when divided by 8, it leaves no remainder."
"Take a closer look at the numbers you listed. For example, is 44 exactly divisible by 8? What about 52? Could you re-examine these numbers and provide a corrected list of the favorable outcomes that are divisible by 8, explaining your reasoning for each number?"
Student: Sure! I will re-evaluate the numbers I previously listed to see which are actually divisible by 8.
1. **16**: \( 16 \div 8 = 2 \) (Divisible by 8)
2. **24**: \( 24 \div 8 = 3 \) (Divisible by 8)
3. **32**: \( 32 \div 8 = 4 \) (Divisible by 8)
4. **44**: \( 44 \div 8 = 5.5 \) (Not divisible by 8)
5. **52**: \( 52 \div 8 = 6.5 \) (Not divisible by 8)
6. **56**: \( 56 \div 8 = 7 \) (Divisible by 8)
7. **64**: \( 64 \div 8 = 8 \) (Divisible by 8)
"So, after re-evaluating, the numbers that are actually divisible by 8 are:"
- 16
- 24
- 32
- 56
- 64
This gives us a total of **5 favorable outcomes** that are divisible by 8.
"Now, what should I do next?"
"Teacher: Excellent work re-evaluating the favorable outcomes! We have found that the numbers divisible by 8 are 16, 24, 32, 56, and 64 – a total of 5 outcomes. Also, remember that earlier we determined there are 36 total outcomes."
"Step 3: Now, please calculate the probability that Nancy’s two-digit number is divisible by 8 by forming the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes. Can you set up and simplify this fraction?"
"Student: Sure! To find the probability that Nancy's two-digit number is divisible by 8, we will use the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes."
"We found that there are **5 favorable outcomes** (16, 24, 32, 56, and 64) that are divisible by 8, and we already determined that there are **36 total outcomes**."
"So, the probability \( P \) can be set up as follows:"
\[
P = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{5}{36}
\]
"Since 5 and 36 have no common factors (other than 1), this fraction is already in its simplest form."
"Therefore, the probability that the resulting integer is divisible by 8 is "
\[
\boxed{\frac{5}{36}}.
\]
"Teacher: Great job working through the problem step by step! You identified that there are 36 possible outcomes and 5 two‑digit numbers (16, 24, 32, 56, and 64) that are divisible by 8. "
"Now, when you set up the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes, you correctly got 5/36. "
Your final answer is 5/36$
