"Question: Nancy generates a two-digit integer by rolling a six-sided die twice. The result of her first roll is the tens digit, and the result of her second roll is the ones digit. What is the probability that the resulting integer is divisible by 8? Express your answer as a common fraction."
"3o-mini: There are 6 options for the tens digit (1–6) and 6 options for the ones digit (1–6), giving a total of 6 × 6 = 36 equally likely outcomes."
"Now, we list the outcomes that yield a two‐digit number divisible by 8:"
"• For tens digit 1: the numbers are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Only 16 is divisible by 8."
"• For tens digit 2: the numbers are 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. Only 24 is divisible by 8."
"• For tens digit 3: the numbers are 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36. Only 32 is divisible by 8."
"• For tens digit 4: the numbers are 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46. None of these is divisible by 8."
"• For tens digit 5: the numbers are 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56. Only 56 is divisible by 8."
"• For tens digit 6: the numbers are 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66. Only 64 is divisible by 8."
"There are 5 favorable outcomes (16, 24, 32, 56, 64) out of 36 possible outcomes."
"Thus, the probability that the resulting integer is divisible by 8 is 5/36."
