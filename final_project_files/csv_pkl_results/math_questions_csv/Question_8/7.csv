"Question: In triangle $ABC$, $\tan \angle CAB = \frac{22}{7}$, and the altitude from $A$ divides $\overline{BC}$ into segments of length $3$ and $17$. What is the area of triangle $ABC$?"
"3o-mini: We are given a triangle ABC in which the altitude from A to side BC meets BC at a point H that divides BC into two segments of lengths 3 and 17. (It does not matter whether BH = 3 and HC = 17 or vice‐versa since the answer comes out the same; here we assume BH = 3 and HC = 17.) In addition, we are told that"
  tan(∠CAB) = 22/7.
Our goal is to find the area of triangle ABC.
Step 1. Express ∠CAB in terms of the altitude.
------------------------------------------------
Drop the altitude from A to BC and let its foot be H. Let
  AH = h  (the altitude from A)
then the two segments are
"  BH = 3  and HC = 17,"
so that
  BC = BH + HC = 20.
"Now, observe the two right triangles AHB and AHC:"
" • In right triangle ABH, the acute angle at A (call it φ) satisfies"
  tan φ = (opposite)/(adjacent) = h/3.
" • In right triangle AHC, the acute angle at A (call it ψ) satisfies"
  tan ψ = h/17.
"Since in triangle ABC, the angle at A is split by the altitude AH (see figure below) into angles φ and ψ, we have"
  ∠CAB = φ + ψ.
Recall the tangent addition formula:
  tan(φ + ψ) = (tan φ + tan ψ) / (1 – tan φ tan ψ).
Substitute the expressions we have:
  tan(∠CAB) = (h/3 + h/17) / [1 – (h/3)(h/17)].
Combine the terms in the numerator:
  h/3 + h/17 = h(17 + 3)/(3×17) = (20h)/51.
"Similarly, for the denominator:"
  1 – (h²/(3×17)) = 1 – (h²/51).
"Thus, we obtain:"
  tan(∠CAB) = (20h/51) / [1 – h²/51] = (20h)/(51 – h²).
Step 2. Use the given tan(∠CAB) = 22/7 to solve for h.
-------------------------------------------------------
We have
  (20h)/(51 – h²) = 22/7.
Cross-multiply:
  20h · 7 = 22 (51 – h²).
"That is,"
  140h = 1122 – 22h².
Rearrange this equation by bringing all terms to one side:
  22h² + 140h – 1122 = 0.
It is convenient to divide the entire equation by 2:
  11h² + 70h – 561 = 0.
We now solve the quadratic using the quadratic formula:
  h = [–70 ± √(70² – 4·11·(–561))] / (2·11).
Compute the discriminant:
"  70² = 4900,"
  and –4·11·(–561) = 4·11·561 = 24684.
"So, the discriminant is:"
  D = 4900 + 24684 = 29584.
Simplify √29584:
"  Notice that 29584 = 16 × 1849, and since 1849 = 43², we have"
   √29584 = √(16×43²) = 4×43 = 172.
"Therefore, the solutions for h are:"
  h = (–70 ± 172) / 22.
Since h is a length we take the positive solution:
  h = (172 – 70)/22 = 102/22 = 51/11.
Step 3. Compute the area of triangle ABC.
-------------------------------------------
The area of triangle ABC is given by
  Area = (1/2) × (base) × (height).
"Here, the base is BC = 20 and the height is h = 51/11. Therefore,"
  Area = (1/2) × 20 × (51/11) = 10 × (51/11) = 510/11.
"Thus, the area of triangle ABC is 510/11."
Final Answer: 510/11.
