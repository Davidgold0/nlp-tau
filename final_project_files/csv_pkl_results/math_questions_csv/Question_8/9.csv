"Question: In triangle $ABC$, $\tan \angle CAB = \frac{22}{7}$, and the altitude from $A$ divides $\overline{BC}$ into segments of length $3$ and $17$. What is the area of triangle $ABC$?"
3o-mini: We are given that in triangle ABC the altitude from A to side BC (with foot D) divides BC into two segments of lengths 3 and 17 (so that BC = 20) and that
  tan ∠CAB = 22/7.
"One useful idea is to “drop” the altitude AD from A to BC and label the segments BD and DC as follows. (The labels 3 and 17 can be interchanged, but the calculations will come out identically.) Assume that BD = 3 and DC = 17."
"Then we have two right triangles, ABD and ADC. In triangle ABD, the angle at A (or more precisely, the angle between AD and AB) has tangent"
"  tan (angle BAD) = AD/BD = h/3,"
         (where h = AD).
"In triangle ADC, the angle at A (the angle between AD and AC) has tangent"
  tan (angle CAD) = AD/DC = h/17.
"Since the angle at A in triangle ABC is the sum of these two angles, we use the tangent-addition formula:"
  tan(A) = (tan(angle BAD) + tan(angle CAD)) / [1 - tan(angle BAD)·tan(angle CAD)]
     = (h/3 + h/17) / [1 - (h/3)(h/17)].
"First, combine the numerators. The sum h/3 + h/17 is"
  h(1/3 + 1/17) = h·(17 + 3)/(3×17) = (20h)/51.
"Also, the product tan(angle BAD)·tan(angle CAD) is"
  (h/3)(h/17) = h²/51.
Thus the formula becomes:
  tan A = (20h/51) / (1 - h²/51) = (20h)/(51 - h²).
"We are given tan A = 22/7, so set:"
  (20h)/(51 - h²) = 22/7.
Solve for h:
1. Cross multiply:
  20h · 7 = 22(51 - h²)
  140h = 1122 - 22h².
2. Rearranging yields:
  22h² + 140h - 1122 = 0.
3. Divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:
  11h² + 70h - 561 = 0.
Now use the quadratic formula:
  h = [ -70 ± √(70² - 4·11·(-561)) ] / (2·11).
Compute the discriminant:
  Δ = 70² + 4·11·561 = 4900 + 4·11·561.
"  First, 4·11·561 = 44·561. Notice 44·560 = 24640, so 44·561 = 24640 + 44 = 24684."
  Thus Δ = 4900 + 24684 = 29584.
"Since 29584 = 4 × 7396 and 7396 is a perfect square (86² = 7396), we have:"
  √Δ = √(4×7396) = 2·86 = 172.
"Thus,"
  h = (–70 + 172) / 22       [we discard the negative root since h > 0]
    = 102/22 = 51/11.
"Now, the area K of triangle ABC is given by:"
  K = ½ × (base) × (height) = ½ × 20 × (51/11)
      = 10 × (51/11) = 510/11.
"Thus, the area of triangle ABC is 510/11."
