"Question: In triangle $ABC$, $\tan \angle CAB = \frac{22}{7}$, and the altitude from $A$ divides $\overline{BC}$ into segments of length $3$ and $17$. What is the area of triangle $ABC$?"
"Teacher: Let’s start by understanding the problem and outlining our steps. We have a triangle ABC with an altitude from A meeting side BC at D. The altitude divides BC into segments of lengths 3 and 17, so BC = 20. We are also given that tan∠CAB = 22/7. Notice that since AD is the altitude, triangles ABD and ADC are right triangles."
Here’s one way to break down the problem:
1. Let h be the altitude AD.
"2. In triangle ABD, angle BAD has tan(angle BAD) = h/3."
"3. In triangle ADC, angle CAD has tan(angle CAD) = h/17."
"4. Since ∠CAB = ∠BAD + ∠CAD, use the tangent addition formula:"
  tan(∠CAB) = (tan(angle BAD) + tan(angle CAD)) / (1 – tan(angle BAD)*tan(angle CAD)).
5. Substitute tan(angle BAD) = h/3 and tan(angle CAD) = h/17 into the formula to get an equation in terms of h.
6. Set that equal to 22/7 and solve for h.
"7. Once you have h, compute the area of triangle ABC using ½ * base * height = ½ * 20 * h."
"Let’s work on step 4. Could you show how you would set up the expression for tan(CAB) in terms of h using the tangent addition formula? Please provide that expression, and we’ll check it together."
Student: Sure! Let's set up the expression for \(\tan(\angle CAB)\) using the tangent addition formula as you guided.
We have:
- \(\tan(\angle BAD) = \frac{h}{3}\)
- \(\tan(\angle CAD) = \frac{h}{17}\)
According to the tangent addition formula:
\[
\tan(\angle CAB) = \frac{\tan(\angle BAD) + \tan(\angle CAD)}{1 - \tan(\angle BAD) \tan(\angle CAD)}
\]
Substituting in our expressions for \(\tan(\angle BAD)\) and \(\tan(\angle CAD)\):
\[
\tan(\angle CAB) = \frac{\frac{h}{3} + \frac{h}{17}}{1 - \left(\frac{h}{3}\right)\left(\frac{h}{17}\right)}
\]
"Now, let's simplify the numerator:"
\[
\frac{h}{3} + \frac{h}{17} = h\left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{17}\right)
\]
"To combine the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is \(51\):"
\[
"\frac{1}{3} = \frac{17}{51}, \quad \frac{1}{17} = \frac{3}{51}"
\]
"So,"
\[
\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{17} = \frac{17 + 3}{51} = \frac{20}{51}
\]
"Thus, the numerator becomes:"
\[
h \cdot \frac{20}{51} = \frac{20h}{51}
\]
Now for the denominator:
\[
1 - \left(\frac{h}{3}\right)\left(\frac{h}{17}\right) = 1 - \frac{h^2}{51} = \frac{51 - h^2}{51}
\]
"Putting it all together, we have:"
\[
\tan(\angle CAB) = \frac{\frac{20h}{51}}{\frac{51 - h^2}{51}} = \frac{20h}{51 - h^2}
\]
Now we can set this equal to \(\frac{22}{7}\):
\[
\frac{20h}{51 - h^2} = \frac{22}{7}
\]
This gives us the equation we need to solve for \(h\). Would you like me to proceed with solving for \(h\) now?
Teacher: Great job setting up the expression! Your work in combining the fractions and simplifying to get
  (20h)/(51 – h²) = 22/7
is absolutely correct.
"Now, for the next step, please solve this equation for h. Start by cross-multiplying to eliminate the fractions, and then simplify and rearrange to get a quadratic equation in h. Show me your work on that step."
Student: Sure! Let's start by cross-multiplying the equation:
\[
\frac{20h}{51 - h^2} = \frac{22}{7}
\]
Cross-multiplying gives us:
\[
20h \cdot 7 = 22 \cdot (51 - h^2)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
140h = 22 \cdot 51 - 22h^2
\]
Calculating \(22 \cdot 51\):
\[
22 \cdot 51 = 1122
\]
So we have:
\[
140h = 1122 - 22h^2
\]
"Rearranging this equation, we move all terms to one side:"
\[
22h^2 + 140h - 1122 = 0
\]
"Now, let's simplify the equation by dividing everything by 2:"
\[
11h^2 + 70h - 561 = 0
\]
"This is our quadratic equation in the standard form \(ah^2 + bh + c = 0\) where \(a = 11\), \(b = 70\), and \(c = -561\)."
"Next, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for \(h\):"
\[
h = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
Substituting in our values:
\[
h = \frac{-70 \pm \sqrt{70^2 - 4 \cdot 11 \cdot (-561)}}{2 \cdot 11}
\]
Calculating \(b^2 - 4ac\):
\[
70^2 = 4900
\]
\[
4 \cdot 11 \cdot 561 = 24684
\]
"Now, adding these together:"
\[
4900 + 24684 = 29584
\]
Now we continue with the quadratic formula:
\[
h = \frac{-70 \pm \sqrt{29584}}{22}
\]
Calculating \(\sqrt{29584}\):
\[
\sqrt{29584} = 172
\]
So we have:
\[
h = \frac{-70 \pm 172}{22}
\]
Calculating the two possible values for \(h\):
1. \(h = \frac{102}{22} = \frac{51}{11}\)
2. \(h = \frac{-242}{22}\) (which is negative and not applicable since height cannot be negative)
"Thus, we find:"
\[
h = \frac{51}{11}
\]
"Now that we have \(h\), we can find the area of triangle \(ABC\) using the formula:"
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 \times h
\]
Substituting \(h\):
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 \times \frac{51}{11} = 10 \times \frac{51}{11} = \frac{510}{11}
\]
"So, the area of triangle \(ABC\) is:"
\[
\boxed{\frac{510}{11}}
\] 
Would you like me to clarify any part of this solution?
Teacher: Fantastic work! You correctly cross-multiplied and rearranged the equation to obtain
"  22h² + 140h – 1122 = 0,"
which simplified to
  11h² + 70h – 561 = 0.
"You then applied the quadratic formula correctly and chose the positive solution h = 51/11. Finally, you computed the triangle’s area as"
  Area = ½ · 20 · (51/11) = 510/11.
Everything checks out perfectly.
510/11$
