"Question: In triangle $ABC$, $\tan \angle CAB = \frac{22}{7}$, and the altitude from $A$ divides $\overline{BC}$ into segments of length $3$ and $17$. What is the area of triangle $ABC$?"
Teacher: Let's start by thinking about the problem step by step.
"We have triangle ABC with altitude AD (from A to BC) landing on D, which splits side BC into two segments of lengths 3 and 17. Let h be the length of the altitude AD. This gives us two right triangles:"
 • Triangle ABD with leg BD = 3 and altitude h.
 • Triangle ADC with leg DC = 17 and altitude h.
"Notice that in triangle ABD, tan(angle DAB) = h/3 and in triangle ADC, tan(angle CAD) = h/17."
"Since angle CAB is the sum of angles DAB and CAD, we can use the tangent addition formula:"
  tan(angle A) = (tan(angle DAB) + tan(angle CAD)) / (1 – tan(angle DAB) · tan(angle CAD)).
"Using our expressions, this becomes:"
  tan(angle A) = (h/3 + h/17) / (1 – (h/3)·(h/17)).
We are given that tan(angle A) = 22/7.
Your first task is to write the equation that sets (h/3 + h/17) / [1 – (h²/(3×17))] equal to 22/7. Could you please set up that equation?
Student: Sure! Let's set up the equation based on the information provided.
We know that:
\[
\tan \angle CAB = \frac{h}{3} + \frac{h}{17}
\]
The tangent addition formula gives us:
\[
\tan \angle CAB = \frac{\left(\frac{h}{3} + \frac{h}{17}\right)}{1 - \left(\frac{h}{3}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{h}{17}\right)}
\]
We need to express this in terms of the given value \( \frac{22}{7} \).
"First, let's simplify the numerator:"
\[
\frac{h}{3} + \frac{h}{17} = h \left( \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{17} \right)
\]
"To add the fractions, find a common denominator, which is \( 51 \):"
\[
"\frac{1}{3} = \frac{17}{51}, \quad \frac{1}{17} = \frac{3}{51}"
\]
"So,"
\[
\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{17} = \frac{17 + 3}{51} = \frac{20}{51}
\]
"Thus, the numerator becomes:"
\[
h \cdot \frac{20}{51}
\]
"Next, let's simplify the denominator:"
\[
1 - \left(\frac{h}{3}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{h}{17}\right) = 1 - \frac{h^2}{51}
\]
Now we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{h \cdot \frac{20}{51}}{1 - \frac{h^2}{51}} = \frac{22}{7}
\]
"To eliminate the fraction, we can cross-multiply:"
\[
7 \cdot h \cdot \frac{20}{51} = 22 \left( 1 - \frac{h^2}{51} \right)
\]
This gives us the equation:
\[
\frac{140h}{51} = 22 - \frac{22h^2}{51}
\]
Now we can multiply through by 51 to eliminate the denominator:
\[
140h = 22 \cdot 51 - 22h^2
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
22h^2 + 140h - 1122 = 0
\]
Would you like me to solve this quadratic equation for \( h \)?
Teacher: Great job setting up the equation! Your steps and simplifications are all correct. Now that we have the equation
  22h² + 140h – 1122 = 0
"the next step is to solve for h. Remember that h represents the length of the altitude, so we are interested in the positive solution."
"Could you please solve this quadratic equation for h, and explain each step of your process?"
Student: Student: Sure! To solve the quadratic equation 
\[
"22h^2 + 140h - 1122 = 0,"
\]
"we can use the quadratic formula, which is given by:"
\[
"h = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},"
\]
"where \(a = 22\), \(b = 140\), and \(c = -1122\)."
### Step 1: Calculate the Discriminant
"First, we need to calculate the discriminant \(b^2 - 4ac\):"
\[
"b^2 = 140^2 = 19600,"
\]
\[
4ac = 4 \cdot 22 \cdot (-1122) = -4 \cdot 22 \cdot 1122 = -98784.
\]
"Now, substituting these values into the discriminant:"
\[
b^2 - 4ac = 19600 - (-98784) = 19600 + 98784 = 118384.
\]
### Step 2: Calculate the Square Root of the Discriminant
"Next, we find the square root of the discriminant:"
\[
\sqrt{118384} = 344.
\]
### Step 3: Substitute into the Quadratic Formula
"Now we substitute \(b\), \(\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}\), and \(a\) into the quadratic formula:"
\[
h = \frac{-140 \pm 344}{2 \cdot 22}.
\]
### Step 4: Calculate the Two Possible Values for h
Calculating the two possible values:
1. **Using the positive sign**:
\[
h = \frac{-140 + 344}{44} = \frac{204}{44} = \frac{51}{11}.
\]
2. **Using the negative sign**:
\[
h = \frac{-140 - 344}{44} = \frac{-484}{44} = -11.
\]
"Since \(h\) represents the length of the altitude, we discard the negative value. Thus, we have:"
\[
h = \frac{51}{11}.
\]
### Final Step: Calculate the Area of Triangle ABC
"Now that we have the height \(h\), we can find the area of triangle \(ABC\). The area \(A\) of a triangle is given by:"
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}.
\]
The base \(BC\) is the sum of the two segments \(BD\) and \(DC\):
\[
BC = 3 + 17 = 20.
\]
Now substituting the values into the area formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 \times \frac{51}{11} = 10 \times \frac{51}{11} = \frac{510}{11}.
\]
"Thus, the area of triangle \(ABC\) is "
\[
\boxed{\frac{510}{11}}.
\] 
Would you like me to clarify any part of this process?
Teacher: Excellent work on applying the quadratic formula and working toward the area! I’d like to discuss your steps to ensure every detail is correct before moving on.
"Step 1: You correctly identified a = 22, b = 140, and c = –1122 for the quadratic equation. Then you used the formula h = (–b ± √(b² – 4ac))⁄(2a)."
"Step 2: You calculated b² = 19600. In computing 4ac, you wrote:"
  4ac = 4 · 22 · (–1122) = –98784.
"Let’s double-check this multiplication. Since 22 · 1122 = 24684, multiplying by 4 gives 4 · 24684 = 98736. (Notice our product here is 98736 rather than 98784.) "
"Step 3: With that correction, the discriminant b² – 4ac becomes:"
  19600 – (–98736) = 19600 + 98736 = 118336.
The square root of 118336 is exactly 344 (since 344² = 118336).
"Step 4: Using this, you obtained:"
  h = (–140 ± 344)⁄44.
"Taking the positive value,"
  h = (–140 + 344)⁄44 = 204⁄44 = 51⁄11.
This is correct!
"Step 5: Then, to get the area of triangle ABC with base BC = 3 + 17 = 20, you used:"
  Area = ½ · 20 · h = 10 · (51⁄11) = 510⁄11.
"That is correct, too!"
Your synthesis is perfect aside from that small arithmetic check on 4ac. Could you please confirm your revised calculation of 4ac as 98736 and then restate the value for the discriminant and h?
Student: Sure! Let's clarify and confirm the calculations step by step.
### Step 1: Coefficients of the Quadratic Equation
The quadratic equation we have is:
\[
22h^2 + 140h - 1122 = 0.
\]
"Here, \(a = 22\), \(b = 140\), and \(c = -1122\)."
### Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant
"Now, let's calculate the discriminant \(b^2 - 4ac\):"
\[
"b^2 = 140^2 = 19600,"
\]
\[
4ac = 4 \cdot 22 \cdot (-1122).
\]
Calculating \(22 \cdot 1122\):
\[
22 \cdot 1122 = 24684.
\]
Now multiplying by 4:
\[
4ac = 4 \cdot (-24684) = -98736.
\]
So the discriminant becomes:
\[
b^2 - 4ac = 19600 - (-98736) = 19600 + 98736 = 118336.
\]
### Step 3: Calculate the Square Root of the Discriminant
"Next, we find the square root of the discriminant:"
\[
\sqrt{118336} = 344.
\]
### Step 4: Substitute into the Quadratic Formula
"Now we substitute \(b\), \(\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}\), and \(a\) into the quadratic formula:"
\[
h = \frac{-140 \pm 344}{2 \cdot 22}.
\]
### Step 5: Calculate the Two Possible Values for h
Calculating the two possible values:
1. **Using the positive sign**:
\[
h = \frac{-140 + 344}{44} = \frac{204}{44} = \frac{51}{11}.
\]
2. **Using the negative sign**:
\[
h = \frac{-140 - 344}{44} = \frac{-484}{44} = -11.
\]
"Since \(h\) represents the length of the altitude, we discard the negative value. Thus, we have:"
\[
h = \frac{51}{11}.
\]
### Final Step: Calculate the Area of Triangle ABC
"Now that we have the height \(h\), we can find the area of triangle \(ABC\). The area \(A\) of a triangle is given by:"
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}.
\]
The base \(BC\) is the sum of the two segments \(BD\) and \(DC\):
\[
BC = 3 + 17 = 20.
\]
Now substituting the values into the area formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 \times \frac{51}{11} = 10 \times \frac{51}{11} = \frac{510}{11}.
\]
"Thus, the area of triangle \(ABC\) is "
\[
\boxed{\frac{510}{11}}.
\]
Thank you for your guidance! Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to discuss.
"Teacher: Excellent work! You've carefully confirmed the calculation for 4ac (which correctly comes out to 98736), computed the discriminant as 19600 + 98736 = 118336, and its square root as 344. Substituting into the quadratic formula gave you h = (–140 + 344)⁄44 = 51⁄11. Then, using the formula for the area of a triangle, with BC = 20, you correctly found that the area is A = ½ × 20 × (51⁄11) = 510⁄11."
The final answer is:
510/11$
