"Question: The equation $x^2-6x+2=29$ has two solutions, $a$ and $b$, with $a\geq b$. What is the value of $2a-3b$?"
3o-mini: We start with the equation:
  x² - 6x + 2 = 29.
Subtract 29 from both sides to set it equal to zero:
  x² - 6x + 2 - 29 = 0  
  x² - 6x - 27 = 0.
"Next, we solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:"
  x = [6 ± √(6² - 4·1·(-27))] / (2)  
   = [6 ± √(36 + 108)] / 2  
   = [6 ± √144] / 2  
   = [6 ± 12] / 2.
This gives us the two solutions:
  x = (6 + 12) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9  
  x = (6 - 12) / 2 = -6 / 2 = -3.
Let a = 9 (the larger solution) and b = -3. We are asked to find 2a - 3b:
  2a - 3b = 2(9) - 3(-3)  
      = 18 + 9  
      = 27.
"Thus, the value of 2a - 3b is 27."
