"Question: The equation $x^2-6x+2=29$ has two solutions, $a$ and $b$, with $a\geq b$. What is the value of $2a-3b$?"
"3o-mini: First, subtract 29 from both sides of the equation to set it to zero:"
  x² - 6x + 2 - 29 = 0
which simplifies to:
  x² - 6x - 27 = 0
"Next, factor the quadratic:"
  x² - 6x - 27 = (x + 3)(x - 9) = 0
Setting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions:
  x + 3 = 0 → x = -3
  x - 9 = 0 → x = 9
"Since a ≥ b, let a = 9 and b = -3."
"Finally, evaluate 2a - 3b:"
  2(9) - 3(-3) = 18 + 9 = 27
"Thus, the value of 2a - 3b is 27."
