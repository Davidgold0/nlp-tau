"Question: The equation $x^2-6x+2=29$ has two solutions, $a$ and $b$, with $a\geq b$. What is the value of $2a-3b$?"
"3o-mini: To solve the equation, first rewrite it by subtracting 29 from both sides:"
  x² - 6x + 2 - 29 = 0  
  x² - 6x - 27 = 0.
"Next, solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:"
  x = [6 ± √(36 - 4(1)(-27))] / 2  
  = [6 ± √(36 + 108)] / 2  
  = [6 ± √144] / 2  
  = [6 ± 12] / 2.
This gives two solutions:
  x = (6 + 12)/2 = 18/2 = 9  
  x = (6 - 12)/2 = (-6)/2 = -3.
Let a = 9 and b = -3 (since a ≥ b). Now calculate 2a - 3b:
  2a - 3b = 2(9) - 3(-3) = 18 + 9 = 27.
"Thus, the value of 2a - 3b is 27."
