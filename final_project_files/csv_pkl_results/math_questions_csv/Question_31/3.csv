"Question: The equation $x^2-6x+2=29$ has two solutions, $a$ and $b$, with $a\geq b$. What is the value of $2a-3b$?"
"Teacher: Let's break down the problem together. We have the equation x² - 6x + 2 = 29, and we need to find the two solutions (we'll call them a and b, with a ≥ b) and then calculate 2a - 3b."
Step 1: We need to rewrite the equation so that one side equals zero. How can you start by doing that? Please show your work for this step.
"Student: To rewrite the equation \( x^2 - 6x + 2 = 29 \) so that one side equals zero, I will first subtract 29 from both sides of the equation. "
Here’s how it looks:
\[
x^2 - 6x + 2 - 29 = 0
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x^2 - 6x - 27 = 0
\]
Now we have the equation in the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \). 
"Is this the correct first step, Teacher?"
Teacher: That's correct! You subtracted 29 from both sides and simplified to get x² - 6x - 27 = 0. Great job!
"Now, for Step 2, we need to solve the quadratic equation x² - 6x - 27 = 0. You can either factor the quadratic (if possible) or use the quadratic formula. What method do you prefer, and what would be the next step to find the solutions? Please show your work or explain your thought process for this next step."
"Student: Student: Thank you, Teacher! I think using the quadratic formula would be a good approach since it will work for any quadratic equation. The quadratic formula is given by:"
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
"In our case, from the equation \(x^2 - 6x - 27 = 0\), we have \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = -27\)."
"Now, I will calculate the discriminant \(b^2 - 4ac\):"
\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-6)^2 - 4(1)(-27) = 36 + 108 = 144
\]
"Since the discriminant is positive, we will have two real solutions. Now, I can substitute \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) into the quadratic formula:"
\[
x = \frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{144}}{2(1)} = \frac{6 \pm 12}{2}
\]
"Now, I will calculate the two possible values for \(x\):"
1. For the positive case:
\[
x = \frac{6 + 12}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
\]
2. For the negative case:
\[
x = \frac{6 - 12}{2} = \frac{-6}{2} = -3
\]
"So, the two solutions are \(a = 9\) and \(b = -3\) (with \(a \geq b\)). "
"Is this correct, Teacher? What should I do next?"
Teacher: Great work on solving the quadratic equation and correctly identifying a = 9 and b = -3!
"Now, for Step 3, we need to find the value of 2a - 3b using the values you found. Can you substitute a = 9 and b = -3 into the expression 2a - 3b and compute the result? Please show your work for this step."
"Student: Thank you, Teacher! Now, I will substitute \(a = 9\) and \(b = -3\) into the expression \(2a - 3b\)."
Here’s how it looks:
\[
2a - 3b = 2(9) - 3(-3)
\]
"Now, I will calculate each part:"
1. Calculate \(2(9)\):
\[
2(9) = 18
\]
2. Calculate \(-3(-3)\):
\[
-3(-3) = 9
\]
"Now, I can combine these results:"
\[
2a - 3b = 18 + 9 = 27
\]
"So, the value of \(2a - 3b\) is \(27\)."
"Is that correct, Teacher?"
"Teacher: Great job working through the problem! Your steps so far have been correct. You correctly rewrote the equation, applied the quadratic formula, and found the two solutions to be a = 9 and b = -3. Then, substituting these values into the expression 2a - 3b, you computed:"
  2a - 3b = 2(9) - 3(-3) = 18 + 9 = 27
That's exactly right!
The final answer is:
27$
