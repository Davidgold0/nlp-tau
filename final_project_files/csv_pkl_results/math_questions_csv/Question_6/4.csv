"Question: Sam decides to start a rumor. Sam tells the rumor to her three friends. Each of Sam's three friends then tells the rumor to three friends who have not heard the rumor. This continues for five total cycles. Sam telling her three friends was the first cycle. How many people, not including Sam, will have heard the rumor when the fifth cycle is complete?"
"Teacher: Let's begin by breaking down the problem. It describes a situation where Sam tells a rumor to 3 friends (this is the first cycle). Then, in each subsequent cycle, each person who knows the rumor tells it to 3 new people who haven't heard it yet. This situation follows a geometric pattern."
"Step 1: Recognize that the number of people who hear the rumor in each cycle forms a geometric sequence. What do you think the first term (the number of people Sam tells in cycle 1) is, and what is the common ratio between the terms? Please work out this step and explain your reasoning."
"Student: In the first cycle, Sam tells the rumor to 3 friends. So, the first term of our sequence, which represents the number of people who hear the rumor in cycle 1, is 3."
"For each subsequent cycle, each person who knows the rumor tells it to 3 new people. This means that the common ratio between the terms is also 3, since every person who knows the rumor tells it to 3 new people."
To summarize:
- The first term (cycle 1) is 3 (the number of friends Sam tells).
- The common ratio is 3 (each person tells 3 new people).
"Does that align with your understanding, Teacher?"
Teacher: Excellent work! You correctly identified that the first term is 3 and that the common ratio is 3.
"Now, let's move to the next step:"
"Step 2: Determine the number of people who hear the rumor in the second cycle. (Remember, each person from the previous cycle tells 3 new people.) "
Please work this out and explain your reasoning.
"Student: Student: Thank you, Teacher! For the second cycle, we need to find out how many new people hear the rumor based on the number of people who heard it in the first cycle."
"In the first cycle, 3 people (Sam's friends) heard the rumor. Now, each of those 3 friends will tell the rumor to 3 new friends. "
"So, for the second cycle, we calculate:"
Number of people in the first cycle (3) multiplied by the number of new people each tells (3):
3 (from the first cycle) × 3 = 9.
"Therefore, in the second cycle, 9 new people hear the rumor."
To summarize:
"- In the second cycle, 9 people hear the rumor."
"Does this make sense, Teacher?"
"Teacher: Great job! Your reasoning for the second cycle is spot on. You correctly multiplied the 3 people from the first cycle by 3, yielding 9 new people in the second cycle."
"Now, let's move on to the next step:"
"Step 3: Determine the number of people who hear the rumor in the third cycle. Remember, in this cycle, every person from the previous cycle (who is 9 in number) tells the rumor to 3 new people. Can you work out this step and explain your reasoning?"
"Student: Student: Thank you, Teacher! For the third cycle, we need to find out how many new people hear the rumor based on the number of people who heard it in the second cycle."
"In the second cycle, 9 people heard the rumor. Now, each of those 9 people will tell the rumor to 3 new friends."
"So, for the third cycle, we calculate:"
Number of people in the second cycle (9) multiplied by the number of new people each tells (3):
9 (from the second cycle) × 3 = 27.
"Therefore, in the third cycle, 27 new people hear the rumor."
To summarize:
"- In the third cycle, 27 people hear the rumor."
"Does this align with your understanding, Teacher?"
Teacher: Excellent work with the third cycle! You correctly determined that 27 new people hear the rumor in cycle 3.
"Now, let’s move to the next step:"
"Step 4: Determine the number of people who hear the rumor in the fourth cycle. Remember, each person from cycle 3 (27 people) tells the rumor to 3 new people. Can you work through this step and explain your reasoning?"
"Student: Student: Thank you, Teacher! For the fourth cycle, we will calculate how many new people hear the rumor based on the number of people who heard it in the third cycle."
"In the third cycle, 27 people heard the rumor. Each of those 27 people will tell the rumor to 3 new friends."
"So, for the fourth cycle, we calculate:"
Number of people in the third cycle (27) multiplied by the number of new people each tells (3):
27 (from the third cycle) × 3 = 81.
"Therefore, in the fourth cycle, 81 new people hear the rumor."
To summarize:
"- In the fourth cycle, 81 people hear the rumor."
"Does this make sense, Teacher?"
Teacher: Great job on step 4! You correctly calculated that 81 new people hear the rumor in the fourth cycle.
"Now, let’s move to Step 5: Determine the number of people who hear the rumor in the fifth cycle. Remember, in this cycle, every person from the fourth cycle (81 people) tells the rumor to 3 new people."
"Please work out this step by calculating 81 multiplied by 3, and explain your reasoning. What do you get for the fifth cycle?"
"Student: Student: Thank you, Teacher! For the fifth cycle, we will calculate how many new people hear the rumor based on the number of people who heard it in the fourth cycle."
"In the fourth cycle, 81 people heard the rumor. Each of those 81 people will tell the rumor to 3 new friends."
"So, for the fifth cycle, we calculate:"
Number of people in the fourth cycle (81) multiplied by the number of new people each tells (3):
81 (from the fourth cycle) × 3 = 243.
"Therefore, in the fifth cycle, 243 new people hear the rumor."
To summarize:
"- In the fifth cycle, 243 people hear the rumor."
"Does this align with your understanding, Teacher?"
Teacher: Excellent work on all the individual cycles! Now we have the following numbers of people who heard the rumor in each cycle:
• Cycle 1: 3  
• Cycle 2: 9  
• Cycle 3: 27  
• Cycle 4: 81  
• Cycle 5: 243  
"Step 6: The next step is to add these values together to find the total number of people, not including Sam, who have heard the rumor after five complete cycles. "
Can you work out this summation? Please show your calculation and explain your reasoning for adding these numbers.
"Student: Student: Thank you, Teacher! To find the total number of people who have heard the rumor after five complete cycles, we need to add the number of people from each cycle together. "
Here are the numbers we calculated for each cycle:
- Cycle 1: 3  
- Cycle 2: 9  
- Cycle 3: 27  
- Cycle 4: 81  
- Cycle 5: 243  
"Now, let's add these values together:"
Total = Cycle 1 + Cycle 2 + Cycle 3 + Cycle 4 + Cycle 5  
Total = 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243  
"Now, we can perform the addition step by step:"
1. 3 + 9 = 12  
2. 12 + 27 = 39  
3. 39 + 81 = 120  
4. 120 + 243 = 363  
"Therefore, the total number of people, not including Sam, who have heard the rumor after five cycles is 363."
To summarize:
- The total number of people who have heard the rumor after five cycles is 363.
"Does this calculation make sense, Teacher?"
Teacher: Great work on summing the totals from all five cycles! Let's review your addition:
• Cycle 1: 3  
• Cycle 2: 9  
• Cycle 3: 27  
• Cycle 4: 81  
• Cycle 5: 243  
You added these as follows:  
3 + 9 = 12  
12 + 27 = 39  
39 + 81 = 120  
120 + 243 = 363
"Your process is logical and correct. Now, can you confirm that adding these numbers gives you the full count of people (excluding Sam) who have heard the rumor by the end of the fifth cycle?"
Take a moment to reflect on this result before we proceed further.
"Student: Student: Thank you, Teacher! Yes, I can confirm that by adding the numbers from each cycle, we arrive at a total of 363 people who have heard the rumor, not including Sam. "
To reflect on the result:
"- We broke down the problem step by step, identifying the number of new people hearing the rumor in each cycle."
- Each cycle increased the number of people exponentially due to the geometric pattern of each person telling 3 new friends.
"- By carefully adding the totals from each cycle, I ensured that I accounted for everyone who heard the rumor."
"So, I feel confident that the total of 363 is indeed accurate for the number of people who have heard the rumor after five cycles. Thank you for guiding me through the process! Is there anything else you would like me to consider or review?"
Teacher: You've done an excellent job working through each step! To summarize:
• Cycle 1: 3  
• Cycle 2: 9  
• Cycle 3: 27  
• Cycle 4: 81  
• Cycle 5: 243  
Adding these together gives:  
3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 = 363
"Thus, a total of 363 people (not including Sam) have heard the rumor after five cycles."
