"Question: Sam decides to start a rumor. Sam tells the rumor to her three friends. Each of Sam's three friends then tells the rumor to three friends who have not heard the rumor. This continues for five total cycles. Sam telling her three friends was the first cycle. How many people, not including Sam, will have heard the rumor when the fifth cycle is complete?"
"3o-mini: In the first cycle, Sam tells 3 friends. In each subsequent cycle, every person who just heard the rumor tells it to 3 new people, creating a geometric progression."
The number of people who hear the rumor in each cycle is:
• Cycle 1: 3
• Cycle 2: 3² = 9
• Cycle 3: 3³ = 27
• Cycle 4: 3⁴ = 81
• Cycle 5: 3⁵ = 243
"To find the total number of people who have heard the rumor (excluding Sam), sum the numbers from all cycles:"
Total = 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 = 363
"So, 363 people will have heard the rumor when the fifth cycle is complete."
