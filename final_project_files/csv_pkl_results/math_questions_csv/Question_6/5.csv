"Question: Sam decides to start a rumor. Sam tells the rumor to her three friends. Each of Sam's three friends then tells the rumor to three friends who have not heard the rumor. This continues for five total cycles. Sam telling her three friends was the first cycle. How many people, not including Sam, will have heard the rumor when the fifth cycle is complete?"
Teacher: Let's start by breaking down the problem into clear steps. We need to figure out how many people (not including Sam) hear the rumor after five cycles. Here's one way to outline our plan:
1. Identify the number of people Sam tells in the first cycle.
"2. Recognize that in each subsequent cycle, each person who just heard the rumor tells it to three new people."
"3. Express the number of people hearing the rumor in each cycle (cycle 1, cycle 2, …, cycle 5)."
4. Sum the numbers from all five cycles to get the total number.
"Now, please tell me: What is the number of people who hear the rumor in the first cycle?"
"Student: In the first cycle, Sam tells the rumor to her three friends. So, the number of people who hear the rumor in the first cycle is 3. "
Shall we move on to the second cycle?
Teacher: Great job! You're absolutely right—the first cycle resulted in 3 people hearing the rumor.
"Now, for the second cycle: Each of those 3 people tells the rumor to 3 new friends. Can you calculate how many people hear the rumor in the second cycle? Take your time and work through this next step."
"Student: Student: In the second cycle, each of the 3 people who heard the rumor tells it to 3 new friends. So, we multiply the number of people by the number of friends they tell: "
3 people × 3 friends each = 9 people.
"Therefore, in the second cycle, 9 new people hear the rumor. "
Shall we proceed to the third cycle?
"Teacher: Great work on the second cycle! Now, let’s move on to the third cycle. Remember the process: in each cycle, every person from the previous cycle tells the rumor to 3 new people. "
Can you calculate how many people hear the rumor in the third cycle? Please show your work for that step.
"Student: Student: In the third cycle, we take the 9 people who heard the rumor in the second cycle. Each of these 9 people tells the rumor to 3 new friends. "
"So, we calculate it like this:"
9 people × 3 friends each = 27 people.
"Therefore, in the third cycle, 27 new people hear the rumor. "
Shall we move on to the fourth cycle?
"Teacher: Excellent work on the third cycle! Now, for the fourth cycle, the pattern continues: every person from the third cycle tells the rumor to 3 new people. "
Could you calculate how many people hear the rumor in the fourth cycle? Please explain your reasoning.
"Student: Student: In the fourth cycle, we start with the 27 people who heard the rumor in the third cycle. Each of these 27 people tells the rumor to 3 new friends. "
"So, we calculate it like this:"
27 people × 3 friends each = 81 people.
"Therefore, in the fourth cycle, 81 new people hear the rumor. "
Shall we proceed to the fifth cycle?
"Teacher: Excellent work on the fourth cycle! Now, for the fifth cycle, we will continue with the same pattern: every person from the fourth cycle tells the rumor to 3 new friends. "
Could you calculate how many people hear the rumor in the fifth cycle? Please explain your reasoning for this step.
"Student: Student: In the fifth cycle, we start with the 81 people who heard the rumor in the fourth cycle. Each of these 81 people tells the rumor to 3 new friends. "
"So, we calculate it like this:"
81 people × 3 friends each = 243 people.
"Therefore, in the fifth cycle, 243 new people hear the rumor. "
"Now, would you like me to summarize the total number of people who heard the rumor across all five cycles?"
"Teacher: Great idea! To summarize, you need to add the number of people from each of the five cycles: 3 (first cycle), 9 (second cycle), 27 (third cycle), 81 (fourth cycle), and 243 (fifth cycle)."
Could you calculate the total sum of these numbers? Please show your work.
"Student: Student: Sure! To find the total number of people who heard the rumor across all five cycles, we need to add the number of people from each cycle together:"
1. First cycle: 3 people
2. Second cycle: 9 people
3. Third cycle: 27 people
4. Fourth cycle: 81 people
5. Fifth cycle: 243 people
"Now, let's add them up:"
3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243
Let's do the addition step by step:
"- First, add the first two numbers: "
  3 + 9 = 12
"- Next, add the result to the third cycle:"
  12 + 27 = 39
"- Then, add the fourth cycle:"
  39 + 81 = 120
"- Finally, add the fifth cycle:"
  120 + 243 = 363
"Therefore, the total number of people who have heard the rumor, not including Sam, is **363**. "
Does this look correct?
"Teacher: Great job! Your addition is correct, and you've carefully summed each cycle: 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 = 363. This means that, excluding Sam, a total of 363 people have heard the rumor after the fifth cycle."
