"Question: Sam decides to start a rumor. Sam tells the rumor to her three friends. Each of Sam's three friends then tells the rumor to three friends who have not heard the rumor. This continues for five total cycles. Sam telling her three friends was the first cycle. How many people, not including Sam, will have heard the rumor when the fifth cycle is complete?"
"3o-mini: In the first cycle, Sam tells the rumor to 3 friends. Every subsequent cycle, each person who heard the rumor in the previous cycle tells it to 3 new people. The number of people who hear the rumor in each cycle is as follows:"
Cycle 1: 3 people (Sam → 3 friends)
Cycle 2: 3 × 3 = 9 people
Cycle 3: 3 × 9 = 27 people
Cycle 4: 3 × 27 = 81 people
Cycle 5: 3 × 81 = 243 people
"To find the total number of people (not including Sam) who have heard the rumor after 5 cycles, add all the numbers together:"
3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 = 363
"Thus, 363 people have heard the rumor after the fifth cycle."
