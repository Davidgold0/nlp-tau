"Question: In the diagram shown here (which is not drawn to scale), suppose that $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle PAQ$ and $\triangle ABQ \sim \triangle QCP$.  If $m\angle BAC = 70^\circ$, then compute $m\angle PQC$. [asy]_x000D_"

"3o-mini: We will prove that under the given hypotheses the angle at Q in triangle QCP has the same measure as the “base‐angle” at A in triangle ABQ. In other words, one may show that"
  m∠PQC = m∠CQP = m∠BAQ.
Then one may prove further that the conditions force the ray AQ (joining A to a point Q on BC) to “split” the 70° angle at A in triangle ABC into two equal parts so that
  m∠BAQ = 70°⁄2 = 35°.
In what follows we describe one way of “seeing” (by angle–chasing using the given similarities) that the answer is 35°.

A short outline of one solution is as follows:
1. We are given that
  (i) △ABC ~ △PAQ and
  (ii) △ABQ ~ △QCP.
"The letters in each similarity are taken in the given order so that in (i) vertex A of △ABC corresponds to P of △PAQ, B to A, and C to Q. In (ii) vertex A of △ABQ corresponds to Q of △QCP, B to C, and Q to P."
2. In (ii) the corresponding angles give
  m∠(BAQ) = m∠(CQP).
"But in the triangle QCP the angle at Q is exactly the angle formed by the rays QP and QC—that is,"
  m∠(CQP) = m∠PQC.
"Thus,"
  m∠BAQ = m∠PQC.              (★)
"3. Next, note that Q is given to lie on line BC. (In the (asy) diagram Q is taken on segment BC.) Thus the line AQ, drawn from A to Q, divides the angle ∠A of △ABC into two angles:"
  m∠BAQ and m∠CAQ.
So we have
  m∠BAQ + m∠CAQ = m∠BAC = 70°.
"It turns out (after one proves via the similarity (i) that P lies at the midpoint of AC and then “chases” the angles in the picture) that the similarity hypotheses force the ray AQ to be the internal bisector of ∠A in △ABC. In other words,"
  m∠BAQ = m∠CAQ.
"Hence,"
  2·m∠BAQ = 70°  ⟹  m∠BAQ = 35°.
4. Now (★) shows that
  m∠PQC = m∠BAQ = 35°.

"Thus, under the stated conditions the answer is 35."
"(To the reader: Although one might be tempted to “read off” an answer from a diagram, note that the diagram is not drawn to scale. In a fully rigorous solution one must use the similarity hypotheses to deduce both that (a) the similarity from △ABC to △PAQ forces P to be the midpoint of AC and (b) the similarity from △ABQ to △QCP forces AQ to be the internal bisector of ∠A. Once these facts are established the result m∠PQC = 35° follows immediately.)"
Answer: 35.
