"Question: Because of redistricting, Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students. This is an increase of $4\%$ over last year's enrollment. What was last year's enrollment?"
Teacher: Let's begin by outlining the steps to solve the problem together:
"1. Define a variable for last year's enrollment (for example, x)."
2. Express the relationship that this year's enrollment is 4% more than last year's enrollment. How can we write this as an equation?
3. Substitute the given value (598) into the equation.
4. Solve the equation for x.
5. Interpret x as last year's enrollment.
"Now, please work on step 2: Write the equation that represents the relationship between last year's enrollment (x) and this year's enrollment, which is 4% higher. What equation do you come up with?"
"Student: To represent the relationship between last year's enrollment and this year's enrollment, I can write the equation based on the information given. "
"Last year's enrollment is represented by \( x \). Since this year's enrollment is 4% higher than last year's, we can express this as:"
\[
\text{This year's enrollment} = \text{Last year's enrollment} + 4\% \text{ of Last year's enrollment}
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
598 = x + 0.04x
\]
Combining the terms on the right side gives:
\[
598 = 1.04x
\]
So the equation that represents the relationship is:
\[
598 = 1.04x
\]
Is that correct?
Teacher: Great work! Your equation 598 = 1.04x is correct.
"Now, move on to the next step: Solve for x. What do you get when you isolate x in the equation 598 = 1.04x? Please show your work."
"Student: To solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 598 = 1.04x \), I will isolate \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by \( 1.04 \)."
Here are the steps:
1. Start with the equation:
   \[
   598 = 1.04x
   \]
2. Divide both sides by \( 1.04 \):
   \[
   x = \frac{598}{1.04}
   \]
"3. Now, I will calculate \( \frac{598}{1.04} \):"
   \[
   x \approx 574.04
   \]
"Since enrollment must be a whole number, we can round this to:"
   \[
   x \approx 574
   \]
"So, last year's enrollment was approximately \( 574 \) students. "
Is that correct?
"Teacher: You're on the right track with your method to solve for x. However, let's revisit the division step carefully. We have the equation:"
  598 = 1.04x
"To isolate x, you correctly divided both sides by 1.04, yielding:"
  x = 598 / 1.04
"Now, one useful technique is to express 1.04 as a fraction. Can you rewrite 1.04 as a fraction and then evaluate 598 divided by that fraction? This might help ensure the arithmetic is accurate."
Please work through recalculating x using the fraction form (hint: 1.04 = 26/25). What value do you get for x?
"Student: To recalculate \( x \) using the fraction form of \( 1.04 \), we can rewrite \( 1.04 \) as \( \frac{26}{25} \)."
"Now, we have the equation:"
\[
x = \frac{598}{1.04} = \frac{598}{\frac{26}{25}}
\]
"When dividing by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:"
\[
x = 598 \times \frac{25}{26}
\]
"Now, let's perform the multiplication:"
"1. First, calculate \( 598 \times 25 \):"
   \[
   598 \times 25 = 14950
   \]
"2. Next, divide \( 14950 \) by \( 26 \):"
   \[
   x = \frac{14950}{26}
   \]
Calculating \( \frac{14950}{26} \) gives:
\[
x = 575
\]
"So, last year's enrollment was \( 575 \) students. "
Is that correct?
Teacher: Excellent work! You correctly expressed 1.04 as 26/25 and proceeded to solve the equation: 
x = 598 × (25/26) = 14950/26 = 575
So last year's enrollment was 575 students.
"Now that we've reached the final answer, we conclude with: "
575$
