"Question: Because of redistricting, Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students. This is an increase of $4\%$ over last year's enrollment. What was last year's enrollment?"
"3o-mini: Let last year's enrollment be x. The enrollment increased by 4% to become 598, so the equation is:"
1.04 Â· x = 598
Solve for x by dividing both sides by 1.04:
x = 598 / 1.04
x = 575
"Thus, last year's enrollment was 575 students."
