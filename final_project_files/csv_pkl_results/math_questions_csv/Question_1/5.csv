"Question: Because of redistricting, Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students. This is an increase of $4\%$ over last year's enrollment. What was last year's enrollment?"
"Teacher: Let's start by understanding what the problem is asking. We know that Liberty Middle School’s enrollment increased by 4% to become 598 students. This means that last year's enrollment, when increased by 4%, gave us the current enrollment."
"To approach this problem, here are the steps we need to follow:"
1. Let x = last year's enrollment.
"2. Since there was a 4% increase, last year's enrollment increased by 4% (which mathematically is 1.04 times x) equals 598."
3. Write the equation based on step 2.
4. Solve the equation for x.
"Now, let's begin with step 1 by setting up the equation: Using x as last year's enrollment, how would you write the equation that represents ""last year's enrollment increased by 4% equals 598""? What is your equation?"
"Student: Sure! Based on the teacher's guidance, I understand that we need to express last year's enrollment (x) with the 4% increase. "
"Since a 4% increase means we multiply last year's enrollment by 1.04, I can write the equation as:"
\[ 1.04x = 598 \]
This equation represents that last year's enrollment increased by 4% equals the current enrollment of 598 students. 
Is this correct?
Teacher: Great job! That equation is correct: 1.04x = 598. 
"Now, what's the next step to isolate x? How can you solve for x using this equation? Please show your work for this step."
"Student: Student: Thank you! To isolate \( x \) in the equation \( 1.04x = 598 \), I need to divide both sides of the equation by 1.04. "
Here's how I can show the work:
\[
x = \frac{598}{1.04}
\]
"Now, I can calculate \( x \):"
\[
x = 574.03846
\]
"Since we're talking about enrollment, I should round this to the nearest whole number. So, last year's enrollment would be approximately 574 students."
Is this the correct approach?
"Teacher: Good attempt! However, it looks like there may be a miscalculation in dividing 598 by 1.04. Remember, when you divide 598 by 1.04, you're essentially undoing the multiplication by 1.04. Can you try recalculating that division carefully? Think about whether the answer should be an exact whole number in this context. What's your revised value for x?"
Student: Thank you for your guidance! I will recalculate \( x \) by dividing 598 by 1.04 more carefully.
"So, we have:"
\[
x = \frac{598}{1.04}
\]
"Now, calculating that:"
\[
x \approx 574.03846
\]
I realized that I need to perform the division accurately. Let me do that step-by-step:
1. 598 divided by 1.04 is:
   \[
   598 \div 1.04 \approx 574.03846
   \]
"Now, rounding that to the nearest whole number gives us:"
\[
x \approx 574
\]
"So, last year's enrollment was approximately **574 students**. "
Is this the correct calculation?
"Teacher: Great effort! However, there seems to be a miscalculation in your division. Remember, our equation was 1.04x = 598. To solve for x, we divide 598 by 1.04. One hint to help: if you suspect x might be a whole number, you can check by multiplying a candidate by 1.04. For example, what do you get if you try x = 575? Could you verify that multiplication and then recalculate the division step carefully? What's your revised value for x?"
Student: Thank you for your patience! I'll check the multiplication for \( x = 575 \) to see if it gives me the correct enrollment after the 4% increase.
Calculating:
\[
1.04 \times 575 = 598
\]
"This multiplication checks out, confirming that if last year's enrollment was 575, the increase would lead to the current enrollment of 598 students."
"Now, I will also recalculate the division to ensure accuracy:"
\[
x = \frac{598}{1.04}
\]
Calculating that step-by-step:
"1. First, I can convert 1.04 to a fraction, which is \( \frac{104}{100} \), but let's stick to decimal for simplicity."
"2. Now, performing the division:"
\[
598 \div 1.04 \approx 575
\]
"So, it looks like last year's enrollment was indeed **575 students**. Thank you for guiding me through this!"
Teacher: Excellent work walking through the process step by step! To summarize:
• We let x be last year’s enrollment.
"• Since there was a 4% increase, the current enrollment is represented by 1.04x."
• We set up the equation 1.04x = 598.
"• By isolating x, we divided both sides by 1.04, leading to x = 598 ÷ 1.04."
"• Checking with multiplication, 1.04 × 575 indeed equals 598."
"Thus, last year’s enrollment is 575$"
Student: Thank you for your guidance throughout this problem! To summarize our solution:
1. We defined \( x \) as last year’s enrollment.
2. We established the equation based on the 4% increase: \( 1.04x = 598 \).
"3. We solved for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.04, leading to \( x = \frac{598}{1.04} \)."
"4. After recalculating, we found \( x \) to be 575."
"So, last year's enrollment at Liberty Middle School was **575 students**. Thank you for helping me understand the steps clearly!"
"Teacher: Great job working through the problem step by step! You've correctly determined that if a 4% increase of last year's enrollment gives 598 students, then by setting up the equation 1.04x = 598 and solving, we find that last year's enrollment is 575. "
575$
