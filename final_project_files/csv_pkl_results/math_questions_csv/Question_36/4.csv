Question: Let $\theta$ be an acute angle such that_x000D_
\[\sin 5 \theta = \sin^5 \theta.\]Compute $\tan 2 \theta.$
Teacher: Let's begin by understanding the problem together. We have an acute angle θ satisfying
  sin 5θ = (sin θ)⁵.
"A useful strategy is to express sin 5θ using the multiple-angle formula. Do you recall the formula for sin 5θ in terms of sin θ? Hint: It can be written as a polynomial in sin θ (for example, sin 5θ = 5 sin θ – 20 sin³θ + 16 sin⁵θ). "
"Once you write that expression down, you can set it equal to (sin θ)⁵, and then you will obtain an equation in sin θ. "
What do you get for the polynomial equation when you set sin 5θ equal to (sin θ)⁵? Please show your work for this step.
Student: Sure! Let's start by using the multiple-angle formula for \(\sin 5\theta\). The formula is:
\[
\sin 5\theta = 16 \sin^5 \theta - 20 \sin^3 \theta + 5 \sin \theta.
\]
"Now, according to the problem, we have:"
\[
\sin 5\theta = \sin^5 \theta.
\]
Setting these two expressions equal gives us:
\[
16 \sin^5 \theta - 20 \sin^3 \theta + 5 \sin \theta = \sin^5 \theta.
\]
"Next, we can rearrange this equation by moving \(\sin^5 \theta\) to the left side:"
\[
16 \sin^5 \theta - \sin^5 \theta - 20 \sin^3 \theta + 5 \sin \theta = 0.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
15 \sin^5 \theta - 20 \sin^3 \theta + 5 \sin \theta = 0.
\]
"Now, we can factor out \(5 \sin \theta\) from the equation:"
\[
5 \sin \theta (3 \sin^4 \theta - 4 \sin^2 \theta + 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two cases to consider:
"1. \(5 \sin \theta = 0\), which is not possible since \(\theta\) is acute and \(\sin \theta\) cannot be zero."
2. The polynomial \(3 \sin^4 \theta - 4 \sin^2 \theta + 1 = 0\).
"Next, we can let \(x = \sin^2 \theta\) and rewrite the polynomial:"
\[
3x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0.
\]
Now we can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 12}}{6} = \frac{4 \pm 2}{6}.
\]
This gives us two possible solutions for \(x\):
"1. \(x = \frac{6}{6} = 1\) (not valid since \(\sin^2 \theta\) must be less than 1 for acute angles),"
2. \(x = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\).
"Thus, we have:"
\[
\sin^2 \theta = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
"Now, we can find \(\tan 2\theta\). We know that:"
\[
\tan 2\theta = \frac{2 \sin \theta \cos \theta}{\cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta}.
\]
"First, we find \(\cos^2 \theta\):"
\[
\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta = 1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}.
\]
"Now, we can calculate \(\sin \theta\) and \(\cos \theta\):"
\[
"\sin \theta = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}, \quad \cos \theta = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}."
\]
Now substituting these into the formula for \(\tan 2\theta\):
\[
\tan 2\theta = \frac{2 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}}{\frac{2}{3} - \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{2 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2}{9}}}{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}}{\frac{1}{3}} = 2\sqrt{2}.
\]
"So, the final answer is:"
\[
\tan 2\theta = 2\sqrt{2}.
\]
"Teacher: Great work outlining the process! I see you used the multiple‐angle formula and factored the equation correctly. Now, before jumping to the final answer, let’s take a closer look at the step where you compute tan 2θ from sin θ and cos θ. "
Here’s a quick recap of the situation:
 • You ended up with sin²θ = 1/3 (since the solution sin²θ = 1 is not possible for an acute angle).
 • Then you found cos²θ = 1 − sin²θ = 2/3.
" • With sin θ = √(1/3) and cos θ = √(2/3), you want to use the double-angle formula"
  tan 2θ = (2 sin θ cos θ) / (cos²θ − sin²θ).
"Now, please work out the following next step:"
" Step: Substitute sin θ and cos θ into the formula for tan 2θ, and simplify the expression as much as possible. "
Could you show your detailed work on substituting the values and simplifying the fraction?
Student: Sure! Let's substitute \(\sin \theta\) and \(\cos \theta\) into the formula for \(\tan 2\theta\) and simplify it step by step.
We have:
\[
"\sin \theta = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}, \quad \cos \theta = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}."
\]
"Now, using the double-angle formula for tangent:"
\[
\tan 2\theta = \frac{2 \sin \theta \cos \theta}{\cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta}.
\]
"First, we calculate \(2 \sin \theta \cos \theta\):"
\[
2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = 2 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{9}} = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}.
\]
"Next, we compute \(\cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta\):"
\[
"\cos^2 \theta = \frac{2}{3}, \quad \sin^2 \theta = \frac{1}{3}."
\]
"Thus, we have:"
\[
\cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta = \frac{2}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
Now we can substitute these results back into the formula for \(\tan 2\theta\):
\[
\tan 2\theta = \frac{\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}}{\frac{1}{3}}.
\]
"When we simplify this fraction, we can multiply by the reciprocal of the denominator:"
\[
\tan 2\theta = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{1} = 2\sqrt{2}.
\]
"So, the final answer is:"
\[
\tan 2\theta = 2\sqrt{2}.
\]

Teacher: You've done an excellent job on the substitution and algebra! Let's review your work together:
1. You started with sin θ = √(1/3) and cos θ = √(2/3).  
2. You correctly computed 2 sin θ·cos θ as 2·√(1/3)·√(2/3) = 2√2/3.
