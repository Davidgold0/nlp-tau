\[\sin 5 \theta = \sin^5 \theta.\]Compute $\tan 2 \theta.$
3o-mini: We start with the given equation for an acute angle θ:
  sin(5θ) = sin⁵θ.
Recall the multiple-angle formula for sine:
  sin(5θ) = 16sin⁵θ − 20sin³θ + 5sinθ.
Setting the two expressions equal gives:
  16sin⁵θ − 20sin³θ + 5sinθ = sin⁵θ.
Subtract sin⁵θ from both sides to obtain:
  15sin⁵θ − 20sin³θ + 5sinθ = 0.
Factor out 5sinθ (which is nonzero since θ is acute and sinθ > 0):
  5sinθ(3sin⁴θ − 4sin²θ + 1) = 0.
"Since sinθ ≠ 0, we solve the quartic polynomial:"
  3sin⁴θ − 4sin²θ + 1 = 0.
Let u = sin²θ to reduce the equation:
  3u² − 4u + 1 = 0.
Using the quadratic formula:
  u = [4 ± √(16 − 12)] / (2×3) = [4 ± 2] / 6.
This gives two potential solutions:
  u = (4 + 2)/6 = 1  or  u = (4 − 2)/6 = 1/3.
"Since sin²θ = 1 corresponds to θ = 90°, which is not acute, we have:"
  sin²θ = 1/3  ⇒  sinθ = 1/√3.
"Next, compute cosθ using the Pythagorean identity:"
  cosθ = √(1 − sin²θ) = √(1 − 1/3) = √(2/3) = (√6)/3.
"Now, find tanθ:"
  tanθ = sinθ/cosθ = (1/√3) / (√(2/3)) = (1/√3) × (√3/√2) = 1/√2.
"To compute tan2θ, use the double-angle formula:"
  tan2θ = (2tanθ) / (1 − tan²θ).
Plug in tanθ = 1/√2:
  tan2θ = (2/√2) / (1 − (1/2)) = (2/√2) / (1/2) = (2/√2) × 2 = 4/√2 = 2√2.
"Thus, the value of tan2θ is:"
  2√2.
