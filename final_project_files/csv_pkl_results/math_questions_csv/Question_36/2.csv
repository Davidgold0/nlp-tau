Question: Let $\theta$ be an acute angle such that_x000D_
\[\sin 5 \theta = \sin^5 \theta.\]Compute $\tan 2 \theta.$
Teacher: Let's begin by understanding what the problem is asking us to do. We have an acute angle θ satisfying
  sin(5θ) = [sin(θ)]⁵
and we need to find tan(2θ).
A good first step is to rephrase the problem in our own words and plan the steps to solve it. Here’s one way to break it down:
1. Express sin(5θ) in terms of sin(θ) (using a trigonometric identity or expansion).
2. Set up the equation sin(5θ) = [sin(θ)]⁵ with that expansion.
3. Simplify the equation and factor out common terms.
"4. Solve the resulting equation for sin(θ), remembering to consider that θ is acute."
"5. Once sin(θ) (or sin²θ) is found, use the Pythagorean identity to find cos(θ)."
6. Compute tan(θ) = sin(θ)/cos(θ).
7. Use the double angle formula for tangent:
  tan(2θ) = [2 tan(θ)] / [1 - tan²(θ)]
to find the final answer.
Let’s start with the very first step:
"Using a known identity, find the expression for sin(5θ) in terms of sin(θ). Can you tell me what expansion or identity we might use for sin(5θ)? Please solve this part and share your reasoning."
"Student: To express \(\sin(5\theta)\) in terms of \(\sin(\theta)\), we can use the multiple angle formula for sine. The formula for \(\sin(5\theta)\) is given by:"
\[
\sin(5\theta) = 16\sin^5(\theta) - 20\sin^3(\theta) + 5\sin(\theta)
\]
"This formula is derived from the general multiple angle formula for sine, which can be established using the angle addition formulas or through induction."
"Now that we have \(\sin(5\theta)\) expressed in terms of \(\sin(\theta)\), we can set up the equation:"
\[
16\sin^5(\theta) - 20\sin^3(\theta) + 5\sin(\theta) = \sin^5(\theta)
\]
"Next, we can simplify this equation by moving all terms to one side:"
\[
16\sin^5(\theta) - \sin^5(\theta) - 20\sin^3(\theta) + 5\sin(\theta) = 0
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
15\sin^5(\theta) - 20\sin^3(\theta) + 5\sin(\theta) = 0
\]
"Now we can factor out the common term, which is \(5\sin(\theta)\):"
\[
5\sin(\theta)(3\sin^4(\theta) - 4\sin^2(\theta) + 1) = 0
\]
"Since \(\theta\) is acute, we discard the solution \(\sin(\theta) = 0\). We now focus on solving:"
\[
3\sin^4(\theta) - 4\sin^2(\theta) + 1 = 0
\]
"Letting \(x = \sin^2(\theta)\), we can rewrite the equation as:"
\[
3x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0
\]
"Now, we can apply the quadratic formula to find \(x\):"
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 12}}{6} = \frac{4 \pm 2}{6}
\]
This gives us two possible solutions for \(x\):
1. \(x = \frac{6}{6} = 1\)
2. \(x = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\)
"Since \(\sin^2(\theta)\) cannot be 1 for an acute angle, we have:"
\[
\sin^2(\theta) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
"Next, we can find \(\cos^2(\theta)\) using the Pythagorean identity:"
\[
\cos^2(\theta) = 1 - \sin^2(\theta) = 1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}
\]
Now we can compute \(\tan(\theta)\):
\[
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}}{\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
"Finally, we can use the double angle formula for tangent to find \(\tan(2\theta)\):"
\[
\tan(2\theta) = \frac{2\tan(\theta)}{1 - \tan^2(\theta)} = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{1 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{1 - \frac{2}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} = 2\sqrt{2}
\]
"So, the final answer is:"
\[
\tan(2\theta) = 2\sqrt{2}
\]
"Does this align with your expectations, teacher?"
Teacher: You've done a very thorough job laying out and solving the problem! Let's review your progress step by step.
1. You began by expressing sin(5θ) using the multiple-angle formula:
  sin(5θ) = 16 sin⁵(θ) – 20 sin³(θ) + 5 sin(θ).
  That was correct.
2. You then set sin(5θ) equal to sin⁵(θ) and brought all terms to one side:
"  16 sin⁵θ – 20 sin³θ + 5 sinθ – sin⁵θ = 0,"
which you correctly simplified to:
  15 sin⁵θ – 20 sin³θ + 5 sinθ = 0.
"3. Next, factoring out 5 sinθ led to:"
  5 sinθ (3 sin⁴θ – 4 sin²θ + 1) = 0.
"Since the angle is acute, sinθ cannot be 0, so you correctly focused on solving"
  3 sin⁴θ – 4 sin²θ + 1 = 0.
"4. Substituting x = sin²θ, you obtained the quadratic:"
"  3x² – 4x + 1 = 0,"
and then solved it with the quadratic formula to get:
  x = 1 or x = 1/3.
"Because sin²θ = 1 would mean sinθ = 1 (which would imply θ = 90° for an acute angle, and 90° is not considered ""acute"" in the typical definition), you correctly eliminated that solution."
"5. That left sin²θ = 1/3. You then computed cos²θ = 1 – 1/3 = 2/3 and derived tanθ = sinθ/cosθ = (1/√3?) → (you obtained tanθ = 1/√2, since you simplified √(1/3) over √(2/3) to 1/√2)."
"6. Finally, using the double-angle formula for tangent:"
"  tan(2θ) = (2 tanθ) / (1 – tan²θ),"
you arrived at tan(2θ) = 2√2.
"Before we proceed to your final answer, I'd like to ask:"
Can you explain in more detail why you eliminated the case sin²θ = 1? What is the reasoning behind discarding that solution for an acute angle?
Student: Certainly! The reason we discarded the solution \(\sin^2(\theta) = 1\) is based on the definition of an acute angle. An acute angle is defined as an angle that is strictly between \(0^\circ\) and \(90^\circ\) (or \(0\) and \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians). 
"If \(\sin^2(\theta) = 1\), this implies that \(\sin(\theta) = 1\). The only angle for which \(\sin(\theta) = 1\) is \(\theta = 90^\circ\) (or \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians). However, \(90^\circ\) is not considered an acute angle, as it is the boundary between acute and right angles. "
"Therefore, since we are specifically looking for acute angles, we can conclude that the solution \(\sin^2(\theta) = 1\) does not satisfy the condition of \(\theta\) being acute, and we discard it. "
This reasoning is crucial in ensuring that our solution remains valid within the constraints of the problem. 
"Now, is there anything else you would like me to clarify or expand upon?"
Teacher: Great explanation on why sin²θ = 1 must be discarded for an acute angle! Your reasoning is correct.
"Now, let’s move on to the next step. We earlier computed sin²θ = 1/3 and cos²θ = 2/3, which allowed us to calculate tanθ as sinθ/cosθ. Based on your work, please take the following next step:"
"Using your computed value of tanθ, apply the double-angle formula for tangent, that is, tan(2θ) = (2 tanθ)/(1 – tan²θ). Can you walk me through how you calculate tan(2θ) step by step with your current value of tanθ?"
Student: Sure! Let's go through the calculation of \(\tan(2\theta)\) step by step using the value we found for \(\tan(\theta)\).
1. **Recall the value of \(\tan(\theta)\)**: We found that \(\tan(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\).
2. **Use the double-angle formula for tangent**: The formula states:
   \[
   \tan(2\theta) = \frac{2\tan(\theta)}{1 - \tan^2(\theta)}.
   \]
3. **Calculate \(\tan^2(\theta)\)**:
   \[
   \tan^2(\theta) = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]
4. **Substitute \(\tan(\theta)\) and \(\tan^2(\theta)\) into the formula**:
   \[
   \tan(2\theta) = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}{1 - \frac{1}{2}}.
   \]
5. **Simplify the denominator**:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]
6. **Now substitute this back into the formula**:
   \[
   \tan(2\theta) = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}{\frac{1}{2}}.
   \]
7. **Multiply by the reciprocal of the denominator**:
   \[
   \tan(2\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 2 = \frac{4}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]
8. **Simplify \(\frac{4}{\sqrt{2}}\)**:
   \[
   \tan(2\theta) = \frac{4}{\sqrt{2}} = 4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 2\sqrt{2}.
   \]
"So, the final answer is:"
\[
\tan(2\theta) = 2\sqrt{2}.
\]
"Does this align with your expectations, teacher?"
Teacher: Excellent work! Your explanation using the double-angle formula and the step-by-step simplification is correct. You've clearly shown that:
"1. tan(θ) = 1/√2, and consequently tan²(θ) = 1/2."
2. Substituting these into the double-angle formula:
  tan(2θ) = [2 tan(θ)] / [1 – tan²(θ)]
  results in tan(2θ) = (2 · 1/√2) / (1 – 1/2) = (2/√2) / (1/2) = 4/√2 = 2√2.
"Your reasoning at every step checks out. Now, based on our discussion, the final computed value is:"
2√2$
