Question: Let $\theta$ be an acute angle such that_x000D_
\[\sin 5 \theta = \sin^5 \theta.\]Compute $\tan 2 \theta.$
3o-mini: We are given that θ is an acute angle satisfying
  sin(5θ) = [sin θ]⁵.
Step 1. Write sin 5θ in terms of sin θ.
"Using the multiple-angle formula, we have"
  sin 5θ = 16 sin⁵θ – 20 sin³θ + 5 sinθ.
"Thus, the equation becomes"
  16 sin⁵θ – 20 sin³θ + 5 sinθ = sin⁵θ.
Step 2. Rearranging the equation.
Subtract sin⁵θ from both sides:
  16 sin⁵θ – 20 sin³θ + 5 sinθ – sin⁵θ = 0
  15 sin⁵θ – 20 sin³θ + 5 sinθ = 0.
"Now, factor out 5 sinθ:"
  5 sinθ (3 sin⁴θ – 4 sin²θ + 1) = 0.
"Since θ is acute, sinθ ≠ 0. Thus, we must have"
  3 sin⁴θ – 4 sin²θ + 1 = 0.
Step 3. Solve for sin²θ.
Let x = sin²θ. Then the equation becomes
  3x² – 4x + 1 = 0.
The quadratic factors or can be solved using the quadratic formula. The discriminant is
  Δ = (–4)² – 4·3·1 = 16 – 12 = 4.
"Thus,"
  x = [4 ± √4]⁄(2·3)
    = [4 ± 2]⁄6.
This gives the solutions
  x = (4 + 2)/6 = 6/6 = 1  and  x = (4 – 2)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3.
"Since sin²θ = 1 would imply sinθ = 1 (i.e. θ = 90°), which is not an acute angle (θ must be less than 90°), we take"
  sin²θ = 1/3.
Step 4. Find tan θ.
"Given sin²θ = 1/3, we have"
  sin θ = 1/√3   (θ is acute).
"Now, compute cos θ using the Pythagorean identity:"
"  cos²θ = 1 – sin²θ = 1 – 1/3 = 2/3,"
  cos θ = √(2/3).
"Thus, tan θ is"
  tan θ = sin θ/cos θ = (1/√3) / √(2/3) = (1/√3) · √(3/2) = 1/√2.
Step 5. Compute tan 2θ.
Recall the double-angle formula for tangent:
  tan 2θ = (2 tan θ) / (1 – tan²θ).
Substitute tan θ = 1/√2:
"  tan²θ = (1/√2)² = 1/2,"
"  1 – tan²θ = 1 – 1/2 = 1/2,"
so that
  tan 2θ = (2 · (1/√2)) / (1/2) = (2/√2) / (1/2) = (√2) / (1/2) = 2√2.
"Thus, the value of tan 2θ is 2√2."
