"Question: Natasha has more than $\$1$ but less than $\$10$ worth of dimes. When she puts her dimes in stacks of 3, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 4, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 5, she also has 1 left over. How many dimes does Natasha have?"
"Teacher: Let's begin by breaking down the problem into clear steps. We know that Natasha’s number of dimes, which we can call n, satisfies these conditions:"
"1. Since she has more than $1 and less than $10 in dimes, and each dime is $0.10, n has to be more than 10 and less than 100."
"2. The problems state that when n is divided by 3, 4, or 5, there’s always a remainder of 1. In other words, n can be written as:"
  n ≡ 1 (mod 3)
  n ≡ 1 (mod 4)
  n ≡ 1 (mod 5)
"3. Notice that if n leaves a remainder 1 when divided by these numbers, then n – 1 is exactly divisible by each of them."
"4. From step 3, we can say that n – 1 is a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5. This LCM will be key in finding n."
"5. Finally, we will check which candidate(s) from this reasoning fall within the range deduced in step 1 (more than 10 and less than 100)."
"Now, let’s start with the first step:"
"Can you write down the congruence equations that represent the condition “Natasha puts her dimes in stacks of 3, 4, and 5 and always has 1 left over”? What do these equations imply about n – 1?"
"Student: Sure! The congruence equations that represent the condition where Natasha puts her dimes in stacks of 3, 4, and 5, and always has 1 left over are:"
1. \( n \equiv 1 \mod 3 \)
2. \( n \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)
3. \( n \equiv 1 \mod 5 \)
"These equations imply that when we subtract 1 from \( n \), we get:"
- \( n - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \)
- \( n - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \)
- \( n - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 5 \)
"This means that \( n - 1 \) is a multiple of 3, 4, and 5. Therefore, \( n - 1 \) is exactly divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. "
"Now, can you help me find the LCM of 3, 4, and 5?"
"Teacher: Great work on setting up the congruence equations and deducing that n – 1 must be divisible by 3, 4, and 5!"
"Now, for the next step, please calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5. What is the LCM, and can you explain how you arrived at that number?"
I'll wait for your answer on this step.
"Student: To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5, we can use the prime factorization method:"
1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - The prime factorization of 3 is \(3^1\).
   - The prime factorization of 4 is \(2^2\).
   - The prime factorization of 5 is \(5^1\).
2. **Taking the highest power of each prime**:
"   - For the prime number 2, the highest power is \(2^2\) (from 4)."
"   - For the prime number 3, the highest power is \(3^1\) (from 3)."
"   - For the prime number 5, the highest power is \(5^1\) (from 5)."
3. **Calculating the LCM**:
   - Multiply these highest powers together: 
   \[
   LCM = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 = 4 \times 3 \times 5
   \]
"   - First, calculate \(4 \times 3 = 12\)."
"   - Then, calculate \(12 \times 5 = 60\)."
"Thus, the LCM of 3, 4, and 5 is \(60\)."
"Now, since \(n - 1\) is a multiple of 60, we can express this as:"
\[
n - 1 = 60k \quad \text{for some integer } k.
\]
"Therefore, \(n = 60k + 1\)."
"Next, can you help me find the possible values of \(n\) that fit within the range of more than 10 and less than 100?"
Teacher: Excellent work so far! We’ve determined that n – 1 must be a multiple of 60. This means we can write n as:
  n = 60k + 1   for some integer k.
"Now, recall from the problem that Natasha has more than $1 but less than $10 in dimes. Since each dime is $0.10, that means:"
  n > 10 (dimes)  and  n < 100 (dimes)
The next step is to determine what integer value(s) of k make n = 60k + 1 fall within this range. Could you please determine which value(s) of k work and calculate the corresponding n?
Student: Sure! We need to find integer values of \( k \) such that \( n = 60k + 1 \) falls within the range of more than 10 and less than 100.
Starting with the inequalities:
1. \( n > 10 \)
2. \( n < 100 \)
Substituting \( n = 60k + 1 \) into these inequalities:
1. \( 60k + 1 > 10 \)
   - Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:
   \[
   60k > 9
   \]
   - Dividing both sides by 60 gives:
   \[
   k > \frac{9}{60} \quad \Rightarrow \quad k > 0.15
   \]
"   Since \( k \) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for \( k \) is \( 1 \)."
2. \( 60k + 1 < 100 \)
   - Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:
   \[
   60k < 99
   \]
   - Dividing both sides by 60 gives:
   \[
   k < \frac{99}{60} \quad \Rightarrow \quad k < 1.65
   \]
   The largest integer value for \( k \) is \( 1 \).
"Thus, the only integer value of \( k \) that satisfies both inequalities is \( k = 1 \)."
"Now, substituting \( k = 1 \) back into the equation for \( n \):"
\[
n = 60(1) + 1 = 60 + 1 = 61.
\]
"So, the only value of \( n \) that fits the conditions is \( n = 61 \)."
"Finally, can you confirm if this value of \( n \) satisfies the original conditions of the problem?"
"Teacher: Great job so far! Now, let's verify your candidate value, n = 61, against the original conditions."
Could you check:
 – What is 61 mod 3?
 – What is 61 mod 4?
 – What is 61 mod 5?
Please compute these remainders and explain whether they all equal 1. This will confirm that 61 indeed meets all the conditions stated in the problem.
"Student: Sure! Let's check the value of \( n = 61 \) against the original conditions by calculating the remainders when 61 is divided by 3, 4, and 5."
1. **Calculating \( 61 \mod 3 \)**:
   \[
   61 \div 3 = 20 \quad \text{(quotient)}
   \]
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \quad \text{(product)}
   \]
   \[
   61 - 60 = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 61 \mod 3 = 1
   \]
2. **Calculating \( 61 \mod 4 \)**:
   \[
   61 \div 4 = 15 \quad \text{(quotient)}
   \]
   \[
   4 \times 15 = 60 \quad \text{(product)}
   \]
   \[
   61 - 60 = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 61 \mod 4 = 1
   \]
3. **Calculating \( 61 \mod 5 \)**:
   \[
   61 \div 5 = 12 \quad \text{(quotient)}
   \]
   \[
   5 \times 12 = 60 \quad \text{(product)}
   \]
   \[
   61 - 60 = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 61 \mod 5 = 1
   \]
"Now, summarizing the results:"
- \( 61 \mod 3 = 1 \)
- \( 61 \mod 4 = 1 \)
- \( 61 \mod 5 = 1 \)
"Since all three calculations give a remainder of 1, this confirms that \( n = 61 \) satisfies the original conditions of the problem. "
"Thus, the final answer is that Natasha has **61 dimes**."
Teacher: Great job working through each step! Let’s summarize:
"1. You recognized that the problem required finding a number n, such that n ≡ 1 mod 3, 4, and 5."
"2. Then you deduced that n – 1 is divisible by 3, 4, and 5, and correctly found the least common multiple to be 60."
3. You expressed n as n = 60k + 1 and determined that the only integer k making n between 11 and 99 is k = 1.
"4. Finally, you verified for n = 61 that when divided by 3, 4, and 5 the remainder is indeed 1."
"Your final answer, that Natasha has 61 dimes, is correct."
61$
