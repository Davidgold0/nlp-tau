"Question: Natasha has more than $\$1$ but less than $\$10$ worth of dimes. When she puts her dimes in stacks of 3, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 4, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 5, she also has 1 left over. How many dimes does Natasha have?"
"Teacher: Let's break down the problem step by step. First, let's rephrase the question in our own words:"
"Natasha has a number of dimes that amounts to more than $1 but less than $10. When she groups her dimes in stacks of 3, 4, or 5, she always has 1 dime left over. We need to find how many dimes she has."
"To start, here is a plan of steps:"
1. Convert the monetary bounds ($1 and $10) into the corresponding number of dimes.
"2. Write the conditions given by the stacking as congruencies (for stacks of 3, 4, and 5)."
"3. Notice that in each case Natasha's number of dimes leaves a remainder of 1, so think about the expression ""d - 1"" and its divisibility properties."
"4. Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5."
"5. Use the LCM and the expression from step 3 to find the possible number(s) of dimes, considering the monetary bounds."
6. Identify the correct number in the specified range.
Let's begin with step 1:
Step 1: Convert the monetary amounts to dimes.
"Since each dime is $0.10, can you tell me:"
a) How many dimes make $1?
b) How many dimes make $10?
Work on that step and then share your reasoning.
Student: Sure! Let's work through step 1 together.
"a) Since each dime is worth $0.10, to find out how many dimes make $1, we can divide $1 by $0.10:"
\[
1 \div 0.10 = 10
\]
"So, there are 10 dimes in $1."
"b) Similarly, to find out how many dimes make $10, we divide $10 by $0.10:"
\[
10 \div 0.10 = 100
\]
"Thus, there are 100 dimes in $10."
"Now, we know that Natasha has more than 10 dimes but less than 100 dimes. This means she has between 11 and 99 dimes. "
What's our next step?
Teacher: Great work on step 1! You correctly determined that Natasha must have between 11 and 99 dimes.
Let's move onto step 2. Here we need to express the stacking conditions using congruences. The problem tells us that:
"• When dimes are arranged in stacks of 3, there is 1 dime left over."
"• When dimes are arranged in stacks of 4, there is 1 dime left over."
"• When dimes are arranged in stacks of 5, there is 1 dime left over."
"This means if n represents the number of dimes, then:"
"• n ≡ 1 (mod 3),"
"• n ≡ 1 (mod 4),"
• n ≡ 1 (mod 5).
"A helpful observation is that if we subtract 1 from n, the result is divisible by 3, 4, and 5. In other words:"
"• n - 1 is divisible by 3, 4, and 5."
"Your turn for step 2: Can you express the stacking conditions in terms of congruences, and rephrase what that implies for n - 1? Provide your reasoning for this step."
Student: Sure! Let's work through step 2 together.
"From the information given, we can express the stacking conditions as congruences:"
- For stacks of 3: \( n \equiv 1 \mod 3 \)
- For stacks of 4: \( n \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)
- For stacks of 5: \( n \equiv 1 \mod 5 \)
"This means that when Natasha arranges her dimes in stacks of 3, 4, or 5, she always has 1 dime left over. "
"If we subtract 1 from \( n \), we can rewrite these congruences as:"
- \( n - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \)
- \( n - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \)
- \( n - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 5 \)
"This implies that \( n - 1 \) is divisible by 3, 4, and 5. "
"Next, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers to determine the form of \( n - 1 \). "
"Now that we've expressed the conditions in terms of \( n - 1 \), what should we do next?"
"Teacher: Great explanation on step 2! Now, let's move to step 3."
"Step 3: We need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5 because we know that n - 1 must be divisible by all three numbers. Can you compute the LCM of 3, 4, and 5? Please show your work and reasoning for this step."
"Student: Sure! Let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5."
"To compute the LCM, we can use the prime factorization method:"
1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - The prime factorization of 3 is \(3^1\).
   - The prime factorization of 4 is \(2^2\).
   - The prime factorization of 5 is \(5^1\).
2. **Identify the highest power of each prime**:
"   - For the prime number 2, the highest power is \(2^2\) (from 4)."
"   - For the prime number 3, the highest power is \(3^1\) (from 3)."
"   - For the prime number 5, the highest power is \(5^1\) (from 5)."
3. **Calculate the LCM**:
   The LCM is found by multiplying the highest powers of all the primes together:
   \[
   \text{LCM} = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 = 4 \times 3 \times 5
   \]
"   Now, let's calculate that step-by-step:"
"   - First, calculate \(4 \times 3 = 12\)."
"   - Then, calculate \(12 \times 5 = 60\)."
"So, the LCM of 3, 4, and 5 is \(60\)."
"This means that \(n - 1\) must be a multiple of 60. Therefore, we can express \(n\) as:"
\[
n = 60k + 1
\]
for some integer \(k\).
"Now, what should we do next with this information?"
Teacher: Excellent work on finding that n = 60k + 1! Now we're onto step 4.
Step 4: Use the expression n = 60k + 1 and the range we established earlier (between 11 and 99 dimes) to figure out the possible value(s) for k.
Can you set up the inequality with n = 60k + 1 and solve for k such that 11 ≤ n ≤ 99? Please let me know your reasoning and the value(s) of k you find.
Student: Sure! Let's set up the inequality using the expression \( n = 60k + 1 \) and the range we established earlier (11 ≤ n ≤ 99).
1. **Set up the inequalities**:
   \[
   11 \leq 60k + 1 \leq 99
   \]
2. **Subtract 1 from all parts of the inequality**:
   \[
   10 \leq 60k \leq 98
   \]
"3. **Now, divide the entire inequality by 60**:"
   \[
   \frac{10}{60} \leq k \leq \frac{98}{60}
   \]
   Simplifying these fractions gives:
   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \leq k \leq \frac{49}{30}
   \]
4. **Calculating the bounds for k**:
   - The lower bound \( \frac{1}{6} \) is approximately 0.1667.
   - The upper bound \( \frac{49}{30} \) is approximately 1.6333.
"Since \( k \) must be an integer, the possible values for \( k \) are 1."
5. **Finding n for k = 1**:
"   Now, let's substitute \( k = 1 \) back into the equation for \( n \):"
   \[
   n = 60(1) + 1 = 61
   \]
"Now we have to check if this value of \( n \) (which is 61) is within the specified range (11 ≤ n ≤ 99). Since 61 is between 11 and 99, it fits within the bounds."
What should we do next to finalize our answer?
"Teacher: Great job establishing that when 11 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n = 60k + 1, the only integer value for k is 1, which gives n = 61. Now, let's proceed to step 5:"
"Step 5: Verify that n = 61 satisfies the original stacking conditions. This means you should check whether 61, when divided by 3, 4, and 5, indeed leaves a remainder of 1."
Can you perform those checks and share your reasoning?
"Student: Sure! Let's verify that \( n = 61 \) satisfies the original stacking conditions by checking the remainders when 61 is divided by 3, 4, and 5."
1. **Check for stacks of 3**:
   \[
   61 \div 3 = 20 \quad \text{(remainder 1)}
   \]
"   To find the remainder, we calculate:"
   \[
   61 - (3 \times 20) = 61 - 60 = 1
   \]
"   So, \( 61 \equiv 1 \mod 3 \)."
2. **Check for stacks of 4**:
   \[
   61 \div 4 = 15 \quad \text{(remainder 1)}
   \]
"   To find the remainder, we calculate:"
   \[
   61 - (4 \times 15) = 61 - 60 = 1
   \]
"   So, \( 61 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)."
3. **Check for stacks of 5**:
   \[
   61 \div 5 = 12 \quad \text{(remainder 1)}
   \]
"   To find the remainder, we calculate:"
   \[
   61 - (5 \times 12) = 61 - 60 = 1
   \]
"   So, \( 61 \equiv 1 \mod 5 \)."
"Since 61 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, 4, and 5, it satisfies all the original stacking conditions."
"Thus, we have verified that the number of dimes Natasha has is \( \boxed{61} \)."
"Teacher: Excellent work verifying that all the stacking conditions are met. You've shown that dividing 61 by 3, 4, or 5 leaves a remainder of 1, and it's within our bounds from 11 to 99 dimes."
"So, the final answer is: 61$"
