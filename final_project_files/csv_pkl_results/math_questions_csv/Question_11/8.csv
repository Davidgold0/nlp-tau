"Question: Natasha has more than $\$1$ but less than $\$10$ worth of dimes. When she puts her dimes in stacks of 3, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 4, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 5, she also has 1 left over. How many dimes does Natasha have?"
"3o-mini: Let n be the number of dimes Natasha has. Since each condition leaves a remainder of 1 when stacking the dimes, we can express this as:"
  n ≡ 1 (mod 3)
  n ≡ 1 (mod 4)
  n ≡ 1 (mod 5)
"This means that n - 1 must be divisible by 3, 4, and 5. The least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, and 5 is 60; hence, we write:"
  n - 1 = 60k  for some integer k
"Thus, n = 60k + 1."
"We are also told Natasha has more than $1 but less than $10 in dimes. Since each dime is $0.10, this means:"
  10 dimes > $1  and  100 dimes < $10
So n must be between 11 and 99. Let's check with k = 1:
  n = 60(1) + 1 = 61
"Since 61 is between 11 and 99, Natasha has 61 dimes. Checking the conditions:"
  61 ≡ 1 (mod 3) → 61 mod 3 = 1
  61 ≡ 1 (mod 4) → 61 mod 4 = 1
  61 ≡ 1 (mod 5) → 61 mod 5 = 1
"Everything checks out, and in terms of value, 61 dimes equal $6.10, which is between $1 and $10."
"Thus, Natasha has 61 dimes."
