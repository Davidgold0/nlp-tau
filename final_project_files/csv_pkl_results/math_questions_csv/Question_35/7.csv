Question: Find all solutions to the equation\[ \sqrt[4]{x} = \frac{12}{7 - \sqrt[4]{x}}.\]
3o-mini: To solve the equation 
"   √[4]{x} = 12 / (7 − √[4]{x}),"
let u = √[4]{x}. The equation becomes
  u = 12 / (7 − u).
Multiplying both sides by (7 − u) gives
  u(7 − u) = 12.
"Expanding and rearranging, we have"
  7u − u² = 12  
  u² − 7u + 12 = 0.
This quadratic factors as
"  (u − 3)(u − 4) = 0,"
so the solutions for u are
  u = 3 or u = 4.
"Since u = √[4]{x}, solve for x by raising both solutions to the fourth power:"
"  If u = 3, then x = 3⁴ = 81.  "
"  If u = 4, then x = 4⁴ = 256."
"Thus, the solutions to the equation are x = 81 and x = 256."
