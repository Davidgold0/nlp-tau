Question: Find all solutions to the equation\[ \sqrt[4]{x} = \frac{12}{7 - \sqrt[4]{x}}.\]
Teacher: Let's start by breaking the problem into smaller parts. We have the equation
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚àö[4](x) = 12/(7 ‚Äì ‚àö[4](x)).
"A common strategy is to introduce a substitution that simplifies the expression. One way to do that is to let u = ‚àö[4](x). This will allow us to work with a simpler equation in u. Once we have that, we can follow these steps:"
1. Rewrite the original equation in terms of u.
2. Clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by (7 ‚Äì u).
3. Rearrange the resulting equation to a standard form (likely a quadratic) and solve for u.
"4. Once you have the values of u, substitute back (remembering u = ‚àö[4](x)) to solve for x by raising u to the fourth power."
"5. Finally, check any restrictions if needed."
Let‚Äôs begin with the first step. Please set u = ‚àö[4](x) and rewrite the given equation in terms of u. What is your rewritten equation?
"Student: Sure! If we let \( u = \sqrt[4]{x} \), then we can rewrite the original equation \( \sqrt[4]{x} = \frac{12}{7 - \sqrt[4]{x}} \) as:"
\[
u = \frac{12}{7 - u}.
\]
This is the rewritten equation in terms of \( u \). What should we do next?
"Teacher: Great job rewriting the equation with u! Now, let‚Äôs move on to the next step. We have:"
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉu = 12/(7 ‚Äì u).
"To eliminate the fraction, try multiplying both sides of the equation by (7 ‚Äì u). What equation do you obtain after multiplying both sides by (7 ‚Äì u)?"
"Student: Sure! If we multiply both sides of the equation \( u = \frac{12}{7 - u} \) by \( (7 - u) \), we get:"
\[
u(7 - u) = 12.
\]
"Now, expanding the left side gives us:"
\[
7u - u^2 = 12.
\]
"Next, we can rearrange this equation to standard form. What should I do now?"
"Teacher: You're doing really well! Now, the goal is to rearrange the equation 7u ‚Äì u¬≤ = 12 into standard quadratic form. Can you do that by moving all terms to one side? What is the resulting equation?"
"Student: Thank you! To rearrange the equation \( 7u - u^2 = 12 \) into standard quadratic form, I will move all terms to one side. This gives us:"
\[
-u^2 + 7u - 12 = 0.
\]
"To write it in standard form, I can multiply the entire equation by -1, which results in:"
\[
u^2 - 7u + 12 = 0.
\]
Now we have the standard quadratic form. What should I do next?
Teacher: You're doing a great job! Now that you have the quadratic equation
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉu¬≤ - 7u + 12 = 0
"the next step is to solve this equation for u. A good approach might be to factor it if possible. Can you try to factor the quadratic? What factors do you get, and what are the resulting values for u?"
"Student: Thank you! To factor the quadratic equation \( u^2 - 7u + 12 = 0 \), I need to find two numbers that multiply to 12 and add up to -7. The numbers that work are -3 and -4. "
"So, I can factor the equation as:"
\[
(u - 3)(u - 4) = 0.
\]
Setting each factor to zero gives us the possible values for \( u \):
1. \( u - 3 = 0 \)  ‚Üí  \( u = 3 \)
2. \( u - 4 = 0 \)  ‚Üí  \( u = 4 \)
Now I have the values for \( u \). What should I do next?
Teacher: Excellent work factorizing the quadratic and finding u = 3 and u = 4. Now we need to substitute back into our original substitution u = ‚àö[4](x) to solve for x.
The next step is:
"‚Ä¢ For each value of u, set up the equation ‚àö[4](x) = u."
‚Ä¢ Then solve for x by raising both sides of the equation to the fourth power.
"Could you please do this for one of the values of u, say u = 3, and tell me what x equals in that case?"
"Student: Sure! If we take the value \( u = 3 \) and substitute it back into the equation \( \sqrt[4]{x} = u \), we have:"
\[
\sqrt[4]{x} = 3.
\]
"To solve for \( x \), I will raise both sides of the equation to the fourth power:"
\[
x = 3^4.
\]
Calculating \( 3^4 \) gives us:
\[
x = 81.
\]
"Now I have found one solution: \( x = 81 \). Should I go ahead and find the solution for the other value of \( u \), which is \( u = 4 \)?"
"Teacher: Great work! You correctly found that substituting u = 3 leads to x = 81. Now, let's do the same for u = 4. Please substitute u = 4 into the equation ‚àö[4](x) = u and solve for x by raising both sides to the fourth power. What value do you get for x in this case?"
"Student: Sure! If we take the value \( u = 4 \) and substitute it back into the equation \( \sqrt[4]{x} = u \), we have:"
\[
\sqrt[4]{x} = 4.
\]
"To solve for \( x \), I will raise both sides of the equation to the fourth power:"
\[
x = 4^4.
\]
Calculating \( 4^4 \) gives us:
\[
x = 256.
\]
Now I have found the second solution: \( x = 256 \). 
"So, the two solutions to the original equation are \( x = 81 \) and \( x = 256 \). Would you like me to check for any restrictions or verify these solutions?"
"Teacher: You're on the right track! Before finalizing our answer, let's verify that the solutions are valid concerning any restrictions. Remember, because we defined u = ‚àö[4](x), what is the domain for both u and x in our original equation? Can you describe these restrictions and check that x = 81 and x = 256 satisfy them?"
"Student: Sure! Since we defined \( u = \sqrt[4]{x} \), we need to consider the domain for \( u \) and \( x \)."
"1. **Domain for \( u \)**: The fourth root function, \( \sqrt[4]{x} \), is defined for \( x \geq 0 \). Therefore, \( u \) must also be non-negative, meaning \( u \geq 0 \)."
"2. **Domain for \( x \)**: Since \( u \) is the fourth root of \( x \), it follows that \( x \) must also be non-negative, which means \( x \geq 0 \)."
Now let's check our solutions:
- For \( x = 81 \):
"  - \( u = \sqrt[4]{81} = 3 \), which is non-negative and satisfies \( u \geq 0 \)."
- For \( x = 256 \):
"  - \( u = \sqrt[4]{256} = 4 \), which is also non-negative and satisfies \( u \geq 0 \)."
Both solutions \( x = 81 \) and \( x = 256 \) satisfy the restrictions of the original equation. 
"Therefore, the final solutions to the equation \( \sqrt[4]{x} = \frac{12}{7 - \sqrt[4]{x}} \) are:"
\[
x = 81 \quad \text{and} \quad x = 256.
\]
Would you like me to summarize everything or assist you with anything else?
Teacher: Great job working through all the steps! To summarize our process:
1. We substituted u = ùúí^(1/4) to rewrite the original equation as u = 12/(7 - u).
2. Multiplying both sides by (7 - u) led us to the equation u(7 - u) = 12.
"3. Expanding and rearranging, we obtained the quadratic equation: u¬≤ - 7u + 12 = 0."
"4. Factoring gave us (u - 3)(u - 4) = 0, so u = 3 and u = 4."
5. Substituting back u = ‚àö[4](x) and solving by raising both sides to the fourth power produced x = 81 and x = 256.
"6. Finally, we verified that both solutions fit the domain restrictions (x ‚â• 0)."
"Thus, the final solutions to the equation are:"
x = 81 and x = 256$
