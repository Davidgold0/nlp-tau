Question: Factor $t^2-121$.
"Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem. We have the expression t² - 121, and our goal is to factor it using the idea of a difference of two squares."
Here are the steps to follow:
1. Recognize that both terms are perfect squares.
"2. Write each term as a square (i.e., express t² as (t)² and 121 as something²)."
3. Apply the difference of squares formula: a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b).
"Let's begin with the first step. Could you please identify what the two terms are as perfect squares? In other words, what is the square form of 121 and what would a and b be in this scenario?"
"Student: Sure! In the expression \( t^2 - 121 \), we can identify the two terms as perfect squares. "
"1. The first term, \( t^2 \), can be expressed as \( (t)^2 \)."
"2. The second term, \( 121 \), can be expressed as \( (11)^2 \) since \( 11 \times 11 = 121 \)."
"So, in this case, we have:"
- \( a = t \)
- \( b = 11 \)
Is that correct?
"Teacher: You're absolutely correct! t² is (t)² and 121 is (11)², with a = t and b = 11."
"Great job on the first step. Now, let's move to the next step. Using the difference of two squares formula, a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b), please apply this formula with a = t and b = 11 to factor the expression t² - 121."
Could you share what you get for this step?
"Student: Student: Sure! Now that we have identified \( a = t \) and \( b = 11 \), we can apply the difference of squares formula \( a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b) \)."
Substituting in our values:
1. \( a + b = t + 11 \)
2. \( a - b = t - 11 \)
"So, when we apply the formula, we get:"
\[
t^2 - 121 = (t + 11)(t - 11)
\]
Is that the correct factorization?
Teacher: Excellent work! You have correctly applied the difference of squares formula. The factorization process is as follows:
1. Recognize that t² = (t)² and 121 = (11)².
2. Apply the formula a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b) with a = t and b = 11.
3. Substitute the values to get: (t + 11)(t - 11).
Your answer is correct! The final factorization is: (t+11)(t-11)$
