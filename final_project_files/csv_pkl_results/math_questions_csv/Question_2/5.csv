Question: Factor $t^2-121$.
Teacher: Let's break down the problem together. We have the expression t² - 121. 
"Step 1: Notice that this is structured as a difference of two squares. Can you identify what the squares are? In other words, rewrite t² and 121 as perfect squares, and then tell me what “a” and “b” would be if we think of the expression in the form a² - b². What are your values for a and b?"
"Student: Sure! In the expression \( t^2 - 121 \), we can identify the squares as follows:"
"- \( t^2 \) is already a perfect square, so we can say \( a = t \)."
"- \( 121 \) is also a perfect square since \( 121 = 11^2 \), so we have \( b = 11 \)."
"So, we have \( a = t \) and \( b = 11 \). "
Is that correct?
"Teacher: Great job identifying a and b correctly! You have t² = t² and 121 = 11², so indeed a = t and b = 11."
"Now, let's move on to the next step. According to the difference of two squares formula, a² - b² factors as (a + b)(a - b)."
Can you apply this formula using your values for a and b to write the factored form of t² - 121? Please show your work for this step.
"Student: Student: Sure! Now that we have identified \( a = t \) and \( b = 11 \), we can apply the difference of two squares formula, which states that \( a^2 - b^2 \) factors as \( (a + b)(a - b) \)."
"So, substituting in our values:"
1. \( a + b = t + 11 \)
2. \( a - b = t - 11 \)
"Now, we can write the factored form of \( t^2 - 121 \):"
\[
t^2 - 121 = (t + 11)(t - 11)
\]
Is that correct?
"Teacher: Excellent work! You correctly identified that t² - 121 is the difference of two squares, where t² is t² and 121 is 11² (so a = t and b = 11). Then, applying the formula a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b), you obtained the factors as (t + 11) and (t - 11)."
To summarize:
1. Recognize t² - 121 as a difference of squares.
2. Write t² - 121 as t² - 11².
3. Factor using (t + 11)(t - 11).
Your final answer is: (t + 11)(t - 11)$
