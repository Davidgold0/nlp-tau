Question: Factor $t^2-121$.
Teacher: Let's begin by understanding the problem. We need to factor the expression t² - 121. 
A helpful strategy is to notice that this expression represents a difference of two squares. The general formula for factoring a difference of squares is:
  a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b)
"Now, could you please identify what a² and b² are in our expression? That is, what are the expressions for a and b such that a² equals t² and b² equals 121?"
"Student: Sure! In the expression \( t^2 - 121 \), we can identify \( a^2 \) and \( b^2 \) as follows:"
"- For \( a^2 = t^2 \), we have \( a = t \)."
"- For \( b^2 = 121 \), we recognize that \( 121 \) is \( 11^2 \), so \( b = 11 \)."
Now we have \( a = t \) and \( b = 11 \). Would you like me to proceed with writing the factored form using these values?
"Teacher: Great work identifying a = t and b = 11. Now, using the difference of two squares formula, a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b), your next step is to substitute these values into the formula. Could you please write out the factored form of t² - 121 using this substitution?"
"Student: Student: Sure! Using the values we identified, where \( a = t \) and \( b = 11 \), we can substitute them into the difference of squares formula:"
\[
t^2 - 121 = (a - b)(a + b) = (t - 11)(t + 11)
\]
"So, the factored form of \( t^2 - 121 \) is \( (t - 11)(t + 11) \). Is there anything else you would like me to do with this expression?"
Teacher: Great job working through the problem step by step! Let's quickly review what we did:
1. You recognized that t² - 121 is a difference of two squares.
2. You identified a² = t² (so a = t) and b² = 121 (so b = 11).
3. You applied the formula a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b) and substituted a and b accordingly.
"Your reasoning was correct, and you successfully wrote the factored form of t² - 121."
Final answer: (t-11)(t+11)$
