"Question: Given that $n$ is an integer and $0 < 4n <30$, what is the sum of all possible integer values of $n$?"
Teacher: Let's begin by breaking down the problem into manageable steps. 
"Step 1: We are given the inequality 0 < 4n < 30. To start, try simplifying this inequality by dividing all parts by 4. What inequality do you get for n? Please show your work for this step."
"Student: To simplify the inequality \(0 < 4n < 30\), I will divide all parts of the inequality by 4."
Starting with the original inequality:
\[
0 < 4n < 30
\]
Dividing all parts by 4 gives:
\[
0 < n < \frac{30}{4}
\]
Calculating \(\frac{30}{4}\):
\[
\frac{30}{4} = 7.5
\]
"So, the simplified inequality for \(n\) is:"
\[
0 < n < 7.5
\]
This means that \(n\) must be an integer greater than 0 and less than 7.5. 
"Now, can you guide me on what to do next with this inequality?"
"Teacher: Great job simplifying the inequality! Now that we have 0 < n < 7.5, the next step is to determine which integer values of n satisfy this inequality."
Step 2: List all the integer values of n that meet the condition 0 < n < 7.5.
Please go ahead and list these values with your reasoning.
"Student: Student: Thank you for the guidance! Since we have the inequality \(0 < n < 7.5\), we need to find all the integer values of \(n\) that are greater than 0 and less than 7.5."
The integer values that satisfy this condition are:
- 1
- 2
- 3
- 4
- 5
- 6
- 7
These values are all the integers from 1 to 7 inclusive. 
"Now, what should I do next with these integer values?"
Teacher: Excellent work listing the possible values for n!
"Step 3: Now, please compute the sum of the integers you listed (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7). You can add them directly or use a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. What is the sum, and how did you calculate it?"
"Student: Thank you for your guidance! To compute the sum of the integers \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\) and \(7\), I can either add them directly or use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series."
**Method 1: Direct Addition**
Let's add them directly:
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28
\]
**Method 2: Arithmetic Series Formula**
"Alternatively, I can use the formula for the sum of the first \(n\) integers, which is given by:"
\[
S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]
where \(n\) is the largest integer in the series.
"In this case, \(n = 7\):"
\[
S = \frac{7(7 + 1)}{2} = \frac{7 \times 8}{2} = \frac{56}{2} = 28
\]
"So, using both methods, I find that the sum of the integers is:"
\[
\boxed{28}
\] 
Is there anything else you would like me to do with this result?
Teacher: You've done great work breaking down the problem and reaching the solution step by step. Here's a brief summary of our process:
"1. We started with the inequality 0 < 4n < 30, then divided it by 4 to obtain 0 < n < 7.5."
"2. We listed out the integers that satisfy 0 < n < 7.5, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7."
"3. Finally, we found the sum of these integers using both direct addition and the arithmetic series formula, arriving at the sum of 28."
Final Answer: 28$
