"Question: Given that $n$ is an integer and $0 < 4n <30$, what is the sum of all possible integer values of $n$?"
3o-mini: We start with the inequality 0 < 4n < 30. Dividing the entire inequality by 4 gives:
  0 < n < 7.5
"Since n must be an integer, the possible values of n are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. "
"Now, add these values together:"
  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28
"Thus, the sum of all possible integer values of n is 28."
