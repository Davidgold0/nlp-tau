"Question: Given that $n$ is an integer and $0 < 4n <30$, what is the sum of all possible integer values of $n$?"
"3o-mini: We are given the inequality 0 < 4n < 30. To find the possible integer values for n, follow these steps:"
1. Divide the entire inequality by 4:
  0 < n < 30/4
  0 < n < 7.5
"2. Since n must be an integer, the possible values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7."
3. Adding these values gives:
  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28
"Thus, the sum of all possible integer values of n is 28."
