"Question: Given that $n$ is an integer and $0 < 4n <30$, what is the sum of all possible integer values of $n$?"
3o-mini: We start with the inequality: 0 < 4n < 30.
Divide the whole inequality by 4:
  0 < n < 7.5.
"Since n is an integer, the possible values for n are:"
"  n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7."
"Now, add these values:"
  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28.
"So, the sum of all possible integer values of n is 28."
