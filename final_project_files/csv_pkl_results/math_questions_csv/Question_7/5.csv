"Question: Given that $n$ is an integer and $0 < 4n <30$, what is the sum of all possible integer values of $n$?"
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem together. We’re told that n is an integer and that 0 < 4n < 30. Our goal is to find the sum of all possible integer values of n. 
Here’s an outline of the steps to solve the problem:
1. Isolate n in the inequality by dividing all parts of the inequality by 4.
2. Identify all the integer values of n that satisfy the resulting inequality.
3. Sum those integer values to get the final answer.
"To begin, please solve the first step: Divide the inequality 0 < 4n < 30 by 4 to isolate n. What inequality for n do you get?"
"Student: To isolate \( n \) in the inequality \( 0 < 4n < 30 \), I will divide all parts of the inequality by 4:"
\[
0 < n < \frac{30}{4}
\]
Calculating \( \frac{30}{4} \) gives:
\[
\frac{30}{4} = 7.5
\]
"So, the resulting inequality is:"
\[
0 < n < 7.5
\]
This means that \( n \) can take on integer values between 0 and 7.5. 
Would you like me to identify the integer values of \( n \) that satisfy this inequality next?
"Teacher: Excellent work on isolating n! Your result, 0 < n < 7.5, is correct."
"Now, let's move to the next step: Identify all integer values of n that satisfy this inequality. Which integers lie between 0 and 7.5? Please list them."
Student: The integer values of \( n \) that satisfy the inequality \( 0 < n < 7.5 \) are:
1. \( n = 1 \)
2. \( n = 2 \)
3. \( n = 3 \)
4. \( n = 4 \)
5. \( n = 5 \)
6. \( n = 6 \)
7. \( n = 7 \)
"So, the integers that satisfy the inequality are \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \) and \( 7 \). "
Would you like me to calculate the sum of these integer values next?
Teacher: Great job identifying the integers that satisfy the inequality!
"Now, for the next step, please calculate the sum of these integers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. What result do you get?"
"Student: To calculate the sum of the integers \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \) and \( 7 \), I can add them together:"
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7
\]
Calculating step by step:
- \( 1 + 2 = 3 \)
- \( 3 + 3 = 6 \)
- \( 6 + 4 = 10 \)
- \( 10 + 5 = 15 \)
- \( 15 + 6 = 21 \)
- \( 21 + 7 = 28 \)
"So, the sum of all the possible integer values of \( n \) is:"
\[
28
\]
Would you like me to summarize the solution or provide any additional information?
"Teacher: Excellent work throughout the steps! You correctly isolated n, identified all integer values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7), and summed them to get 28."
The final answer is 28$
