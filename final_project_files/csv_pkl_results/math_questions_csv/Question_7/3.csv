"Question: Given that $n$ is an integer and $0 < 4n <30$, what is the sum of all possible integer values of $n$?"
Teacher: Let's start by outlining the steps we need to work through:
1. Rephrase the given inequality to understand the range for n.
2. Manipulate the inequality 0 < 4n < 30 to isolate n.
3. Identify all the possible integer values of n based on that inequality.
4. Sum those integer values.
"Now, let's take it one step at a time. For the first step, could you please simplify or rewrite the inequality 0 < 4n < 30 to explicitly see what the range for n is? What is the expression that gives you the range on n?"
"Student: Sure! To rewrite the inequality \(0 < 4n < 30\), we can break it down into two parts."
"1. From \(0 < 4n\), we can divide both sides by 4 (since 4 is positive), which gives us \(0 < n\)."
"2. From \(4n < 30\), we can also divide both sides by 4, leading to \(n < \frac{30}{4}\), which simplifies to \(n < 7.5\)."
"Putting these two results together, we have:"
\[
0 < n < 7.5
\]
This tells us that \(n\) must be greater than 0 and less than 7.5. 
Is that the correct way to express the range for \(n\)?
"Teacher: Great job on isolating n! You correctly rewrote the inequality as 0 < n < 7.5, which means n must be greater than 0 and less than 7.5. "
"Now, for the next step, could you please list all the possible integer values of n that satisfy this inequality? Remember to think about which integers fall strictly between 0 and 7.5."
"Student: Student: Thank you! Based on the inequality \(0 < n < 7.5\), the possible integer values of \(n\) that satisfy this condition are:"
1. \(1\)
2. \(2\)
3. \(3\)
4. \(4\)
5. \(5\)
6. \(6\)
7. \(7\)
"So, the integers that fall strictly between 0 and 7.5 are \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \text{ and } 7\). "
Is this the correct list of integer values for \(n\)?
"Teacher: You're correct! The possible integer values for n are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7."
"Now, let's move to the next step: Can you please compute the sum of these integer values? Remember to add each number carefully to arrive at the final result."
"Student: Sure! To compute the sum of the integer values \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \text{ and } 7\), I will add them together step by step:"
\[
1 + 2 = 3
\]
\[
3 + 3 = 6
\]
\[
6 + 4 = 10
\]
\[
10 + 5 = 15
\]
\[
15 + 6 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 7 = 28
\]
"So, the sum of all possible integer values of \(n\) is \(28\)."
Is this the correct final answer?
"Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly identified the integer values from the inequality 0 < n < 7.5 as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, and your sum of these integers is indeed 28. "
The final answer is: 28$
