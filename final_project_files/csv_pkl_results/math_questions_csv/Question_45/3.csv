Question: If $n$ is the smallest positive integer for which there exist positive real numbers $a$ and $b$ such that_x000D_
"\[(a + bi)^n = (a - bi)^n,\]compute $\frac{b}{a}.$"
Teacher: Let’s begin by rephrasing the problem in our own words. We have positive real numbers a and b and a positive integer n such that
  (a + bi)^n = (a − bi)^n.
The goal is to find the ratio b/a under the condition that n is the smallest positive integer for which such a and b exist.
Here’s a plan outlining the steps we might take to solve this:
"1. Notice that since (a − bi) is the complex conjugate of (a + bi) and both a and b are positive, we can consider the quotient (a + bi)/(a − bi). Write the given equation in the form [(a + bi)/(a − bi)]^n = 1."
"2. Recognize that a complex number raised to the nᵗʰ power equals 1 if and only if it is an nᵗʰ root of unity (with careful note that it shouldn’t equal 1 trivially, given that a and b are both positive)."
"3. Express (a + bi)/(a − bi) in polar form. Notice that (a + bi) and (a − bi) have the same modulus, so the quotient will be of the form e^(2iθ), where θ is the argument of (a + bi). Relate θ to a and b using the tangent function."
"4. Set up the equation e^(2i nθ) = 1, and from this deduce that 2nθ must be an integer multiple of 2π."
5. Solve for θ and substitute back the expression in terms of a and b. This will let you express tan(θ) = b/a in terms of n.
6. Determine the smallest positive integer n that leads to a feasible positive ratio b/a.
"Now, let’s start with the first step together:"
Step 1: Write the original equation as a quotient raised to the nᵗʰ power. How can you rewrite (a + bi)^n = (a − bi)^n in a way that isolates a complex number raised to the nᵗʰ power equalling 1? 
Please provide your work for this step.
"Student: Sure! To rewrite the equation \((a + bi)^n = (a - bi)^n\) in a way that isolates a complex number raised to the \(n\)th power equaling 1, we can start by dividing both sides by \((a - bi)^n\):"
\[
\frac{(a + bi)^n}{(a - bi)^n} = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\left(\frac{a + bi}{a - bi}\right)^n = 1.
\]
"Now, we can denote the quotient \(\frac{a + bi}{a - bi}\) as \(z\):"
\[
z^n = 1.
\]
"This means that \(z\) must be an \(n\)th root of unity. Since \(z\) is a complex number, we can express it in polar form. "
"Next, let's simplify \(\frac{a + bi}{a - bi}\):"
"To do this, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:"
\[
z = \frac{(a + bi)(a + bi)}{(a - bi)(a + bi)} = \frac{(a + bi)^2}{a^2 + b^2}.
\]
Calculating the numerator:
\[
(a + bi)^2 = a^2 + 2abi - b^2 = (a^2 - b^2) + 2abi.
\]
The denominator is:
\[
a^2 + b^2.
\]
"Thus, we have:"
\[
z = \frac{(a^2 - b^2) + 2abi}{a^2 + b^2}.
\]
"Now, we can express \(z\) in polar form. The modulus of \(z\) is:"
\[
"|z| = 1,"
\]
and the argument \(\theta\) can be found using:
\[
\tan(\theta) = \frac{2ab}{a^2 - b^2}.
\]
"Now, we can relate this back to the \(n\)th roots of unity. "
"The next step is to set up the equation \(e^{2i n \theta} = 1\), which tells us that \(2n\theta\) must be an integer multiple of \(2\pi\). "
Would you like me to proceed with this next step?
Teacher: Great job on rewriting the equation as zⁿ = 1 and expressing z = (a + bi)/(a − bi). I see that you then simplified it to
  z = [(a + bi)²]⁄(a² + b²) = [(a² − b²) + 2abi]⁄(a² + b²).
This is a valid approach since multiplying numerator and denominator by (a + bi) transforms the fraction correctly. I also notice you mentioned expressing z in polar form and talked about tan-relationships. 
"Before moving on, let’s examine that part a bit more. Recall that if we set a + bi = r·e^(iθ) with θ = arctan(b⁄a) (since a and b are positive), then its conjugate is r·e^(–iθ) and the quotient becomes"
  (a + bi)/(a − bi) = e^(2iθ).
"Thus, the angle for z is 2θ and we have the relation"
  tan(2θ) = (2tanθ)⁄(1 – tan²θ) = (2(b⁄a))⁄(1 – (b⁄a)²) = (2ab)/(a² – b²).
"Your expression for tan(2θ) matches this, which is great!"
"Now, based on zⁿ = 1 and z = e^(2iθ), we can say that"
  (e^(2iθ))ⁿ = e^(2i nθ) = 1.
Our next step is to set up the equation that comes from e^(2i nθ) = 1. This will tell us what condition 2nθ must satisfy. 
"So, can you please set up this equation (in terms of 2nθ and 2π) and explain what it implies about 2nθ? Please share your work for this step."
"Student: Sure! From the equation \(e^{2i n \theta} = 1\), we know that for this equality to hold, the exponent \(2n\theta\) must be an integer multiple of \(2\pi\). This can be expressed mathematically as:"
\[
"2n\theta = 2k\pi,"
\]
where \(k\) is some integer. 
Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:
\[
n\theta = k\pi.
\]
"From this equation, we can solve for \(\theta\):"
\[
\theta = \frac{k\pi}{n}.
\]
"Now, since we have already established that \(\tan(\theta) = \frac{b}{a}\), we can substitute \(\theta\) back into the tangent function:"
\[
\tan\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) = \frac{b}{a}.
\]
This means that the ratio \(\frac{b}{a}\) can be expressed in terms of \(k\) and \(n\) as:
\[
\frac{b}{a} = \tan\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right).
\]
"Next, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \(n\) such that there exist positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) that satisfy this condition. "
"To find the smallest \(n\), we can analyze the values of \(\tan\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right)\) for different integers \(k\) and \(n\). "
The simplest case to consider is when \(k = 1\). This gives us:
\[
\frac{b}{a} = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right).
\]
We can now explore the values for \(n\) starting from \(n = 1\) upwards to find the smallest \(n\) for which \(\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)\) is defined and positive.
Would you like me to evaluate this for small values of \(n\) to find the smallest one?
Teacher: Great work! You've set up the equation correctly and arrived at
  tan(θ) = b/a with θ = kπ/n.
"Since a and b are positive, we need tan(θ) to be positive and finite. Typically, the simplest case to consider is k = 1, so we have"
  b/a = tan(π/n).
"Now, for this expression to be valid with positive a and b, tan(π/n) must be defined and positive. That means π/n must be an angle in the first quadrant (i.e. between 0 and π/2). "
The next step is:
Step 3: Determine the smallest positive integer n for which
  tan(π/n)
"is defined and positive (keeping in mind that a and b are positive, so b/a must be a positive real number). "
Can you check the small values of n (starting from 1) and determine the smallest such n along with the corresponding value of tan(π/n)? Please share your work for this step.
Student: Sure! Let's evaluate the expression \(\tan(\frac{\pi}{n})\) for the smallest positive integers \(n\) starting from \(1\):
1. **For \(n = 1\)**:
   \[
   \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{1}\right) = \tan(\pi) = 0.
   \]
   This is not positive.
2. **For \(n = 2\)**:
   \[
   \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \tan\left(90^\circ\right) \text{ is undefined.}
   \]
   This is not valid.
3. **For \(n = 3\)**:
   \[
   \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \tan\left(60^\circ\right) = \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732.
   \]
   This is positive.
4. **For \(n = 4\)**:
   \[
   \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \tan\left(45^\circ\right) = 1.
   \]
   This is also positive.
5. **For \(n = 5\)**:
   \[
   \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) \text{ is positive but less than 1.}
   \]
"From the evaluations above, the smallest value of \(n\) for which \(\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)\) is positive is \(n = 3\)."
"Now, substituting \(n = 3\) into the expression:"
\[
\frac{b}{a} = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \sqrt{3}.
\]
"Thus, the ratio \(\frac{b}{a}\) is \(\sqrt{3}\)."
Would you like me to summarize the final answer?
Teacher: Excellent work! You correctly evaluated tan(π/n) for the smallest positive integers and concluded that for n = 3 we have
  b/a = tan(π/3) = √3.
"Thus, the ratio b/a is √3."
√3$
