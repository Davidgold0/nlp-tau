Question: If $n$ is the smallest positive integer for which there exist positive real numbers $a$ and $b$ such that_x000D_
"\[(a + bi)^n = (a - bi)^n,\]compute $\frac{b}{a}.$"
"Teacher: Let's begin by breaking down the problem into manageable steps. First, restate what the problem asks in your own words: "
We have positive numbers a and b and a smallest positive integer n for which (a + bi)ⁿ = (a – bi)ⁿ. We want to find the ratio b/a.
"To tackle this, we can follow these steps:"
"1. Express a + bi in polar form as r·e^(iθ), where r is the modulus and θ is the argument (with 0 < θ < π/2 since a and b are positive). Do the same for a – bi."
2. Raise both expressions to the nth power.
3. Equate the results and deduce an equation relating n and θ (using the fact that the moduli are the same).
4. Identify the needed condition (likely involving equality of the arguments up to multiples of 2π).
5. Choose the smallest positive integer n that makes sense given the conditions (keeping in mind θ must be between 0 and π/2).
6. Translate that condition back to determine b/a.
"Now, let's start with the first step:"
Please express (a + bi) in its polar form. What is r and what is θ in terms of a and b?
"Student: To express \( a + bi \) in polar form, we need to find the modulus \( r \) and the argument \( \theta \)."
1. **Modulus \( r \)**: The modulus is given by the formula:
   \[
   r = |a + bi| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
   \]
2. **Argument \( \theta \)**: The argument can be calculated using the arctangent function:
   \[
   \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)
   \]
"So, we can express \( a + bi \) in polar form as:"
\[
a + bi = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \cdot e^{i \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)}
\]
"Now, let's do the same for \( a - bi \):"
1. **Modulus**: The modulus remains the same:
   \[
   r = |a - bi| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
   \]
2. **Argument**: The argument is:
   \[
   \theta' = \tan^{-1}\left(-\frac{b}{a}\right) = -\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)
   \]
"Thus, we can express \( a - bi \) in polar form as:"
\[
a - bi = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \cdot e^{-i \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)}
\]
Now we have both expressions in polar form. What's the next step we should take?
"Teacher: Great work on expressing both a + bi and a – bi in polar form. Now for the next step, we need to raise both expressions to the nᵗʰ power."
"Remember that when you raise a complex number in polar form, say r·e^(iθ), to the power n, you get:"
  rⁿ · e^(i n θ).
"Could you please compute (a + bi)ⁿ and (a – bi)ⁿ using this idea and then set them equal, noting that (a + bi)ⁿ = (a – bi)ⁿ? What do you obtain?"
Student: Sure! Let's raise both expressions to the \( n \)ᵗʰ power using the polar form we derived earlier.
1. For \( a + bi \):
   \[
   (a + bi)^n = \left(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \cdot e^{i \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)}\right)^n = \left(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\right)^n \cdot e^{i n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)} = (a^2 + b^2)^{n/2} \cdot e^{i n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)}
   \]
2. For \( a - bi \):
   \[
   (a - bi)^n = \left(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \cdot e^{-i \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)}\right)^n = \left(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\right)^n \cdot e^{-i n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)} = (a^2 + b^2)^{n/2} \cdot e^{-i n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)}
   \]
Now we set these two expressions equal to each other:
\[
(a^2 + b^2)^{n/2} \cdot e^{i n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)} = (a^2 + b^2)^{n/2} \cdot e^{-i n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)}
\]
"Since the moduli are the same, we can divide both sides by \((a^2 + b^2)^{n/2}\) (which is positive and non-zero) to get:"
\[
e^{i n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)} = e^{-i n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)}
\]
What can we conclude from this equality of the exponential terms?
"Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly raised both expressions to the nᵗʰ power and set them equal. Now, focusing on the equation"
"  e^(i·n·tan⁻¹(b/a)) = e^(–i·n·tan⁻¹(b/a)),"
"what does this equality tell us about the exponent? In other words, think about what must be true about the angles so that these complex exponentials are equal. "
Please express that condition and share your reasoning.
Student: Student: Thank you! From the equation 
\[
"e^{i n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)} = e^{-i n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)},"
\]
we can conclude that the exponents must differ by a multiple of \(2\pi\). This gives us the condition:
\[
"n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = -n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) + 2k\pi,"
\]
for some integer \(k\). 
"Simplifying this, we can add \(n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\) to both sides:"
\[
2n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = 2k\pi.
\]
"Dividing both sides by 2, we get:"
\[
n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = k\pi.
\]
This means that 
\[
\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = \frac{k\pi}{n}.
\]
"Now, since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\) must be in the range \( (0, \frac{\pi}{2}) \). Therefore, the possible values for \(k\) must be such that \(k\pi/n\) stays within this range."
"To satisfy this condition, the smallest \(n\) that allows \(k\) to be a positive integer is \(n = 2\) (since for \(k = 1\), we have \(\frac{\pi}{2}\)). "
Now substituting \(n = 2\) back into the equation gives:
\[
\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4}.
\]
This implies that:
\[
\frac{b}{a} = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = 1.
\]
"Thus, we find that:"
\[
\frac{b}{a} = 1.
\]
This means \(b = a\). 
What do you think about this reasoning? Is there anything we should double-check or clarify?
Teacher: You've done a good job setting up the condition from the exponentials. Now recall that from
"  e^(i·n·tan⁻¹(b/a)) = e^(–i·n·tan⁻¹(b/a)),"
you deduced that
  n·tan⁻¹(b/a) = kπ   (for some integer k).
You then wrote
  tan⁻¹(b/a) = (kπ)/n.
"However, before choosing a specific value for n, we must remember that a and b are positive, so the angle tan⁻¹(b/a) lies strictly between 0 and π/2. This restriction is crucial in picking the correct values for k and n."
"Can you check what happens if you choose k = 1? What conditions must n satisfy so that (π)/n is strictly less than (π)/2? Based on that, what is the smallest possible value of n, and then what does tan⁻¹(b/a) equal?"
Student: Thank you for your guidance! Let's carefully analyze the condition we derived:
\[
\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = \frac{k\pi}{n}.
\]
"Given that \( \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \) is strictly between \( 0 \) and \( \frac{\pi}{2} \), we need to ensure that:"
\[
\frac{k\pi}{n} < \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{k}{n} < \frac{1}{2}.
\]
"If we choose \( k = 1 \), then we have:"
\[
\frac{1}{n} < \frac{1}{2} \implies n > 2.
\]
"So, \( n \) must be at least \( 3 \) if \( k = 1 \). "
"Now, let's check what happens if we choose \( k = 2 \):"
\[
\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = \frac{2\pi}{n}.
\]
"In this case, we have:"
\[
\frac{2}{n} < \frac{1}{2} \implies n > 4.
\]
"Thus, \( n \) must be at least \( 5 \) if \( k = 2 \)."
"Now, if we choose \( k = 1 \) and \( n = 3 \), we have:"
\[
\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = \frac{\pi}{3}.
\]
This means:
\[
\frac{b}{a} = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \sqrt{3}.
\]
"However, we want the smallest \( n \). "
"If we take \( k = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \), we have:"
\[
\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4}.
\]
This gives:
\[
\frac{b}{a} = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = 1.
\]
"Since \( n = 2 \) is the smallest integer satisfying our conditions, we conclude:"
\[
\frac{b}{a} = 1.
\]
"So, the final answer is:"
\[
\frac{b}{a} = 1.
\]
Thank you for your help in clarifying the reasoning!
Teacher: Let's review your work carefully. You correctly reached the point where we had
  n·tan⁻¹(b/a) = kπ      (1)
which can be rewritten as
  tan⁻¹(b/a) = (kπ)/n.
"Remember that since a and b are positive, tan⁻¹(b/a) must lie strictly between 0 and π/2. This means we require"
  0 < (kπ)/n < π/2     (2)
"Now, if you choose k = 1 (the smallest positive integer), inequality (2) becomes"
  0 < π/n < π/2      or equivalently  1/n < 1/2.
What does that inequality tell you about n? Can you determine the smallest possible positive integer n that satisfies it? Please solve that part and then determine tan⁻¹(b/a) accordingly.
Student: Thank you for your guidance! Let's analyze the inequality we derived:
From the inequality 
\[
"0 < \frac{\pi}{n} < \frac{\pi}{2},"
\]
we can simplify this to:
\[
\frac{1}{n} < \frac{1}{2}.
\]
This implies:
\[
n > 2.
\]
"Since we are looking for the smallest positive integer \( n \), the smallest integer greater than 2 is \( n = 3 \)."
"Now, substituting \( n = 3 \) into the equation we have:"
\[
\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = \frac{1 \cdot \pi}{3} = \frac{\pi}{3}.
\]
This means:
\[
\frac{b}{a} = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \sqrt{3}.
\]
"Thus, the final answer is:"
\[
\frac{b}{a} = \sqrt{3}.
\]
Thank you for your help in clarifying the reasoning!
Teacher: You've done a great job working through the steps. Let’s review what we’ve established:
1. We started with (a + bi) and (a − bi) in polar form and raised them to the nᵗʰ power.
2. This led to the condition that n·tan⁻¹(b/a) must equal an integer multiple of π.
"3. Choosing k = 1 (the smallest positive integer) and recalling that tan⁻¹(b/a) must be in (0, π/2) forces (π/n) to be less than π/2. That simplifies to 1/n < 1/2, hence n must be greater than 2."
"4. The smallest integer greater than 2 is n = 3, so tan⁻¹(b/a) = π/3, which implies b/a = tan(π/3) = √3."
"You reached the conclusion that b/a = √3 using n = 3, and that is indeed correct."
Great work!
√3$
