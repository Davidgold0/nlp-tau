3o-mini: We are given that for some positive integer n there exist positive real numbers a and b such that
  (a + bi)ⁿ = (a − bi)ⁿ.
Step 1. Express in polar form.  
Write a + bi in polar form as  
  a + bi = r · (cos θ + i sin θ)  
"where r = √(a² + b²) and θ = arctan(b/a) (with 0 < θ < π/2 since a, b > 0). Then the conjugate is  "
  a − bi = r · (cos θ − i sin θ) = r · (cos(−θ) + i sin(−θ)).
Step 2. Raise to the nth power.  
"Using De Moivre’s Theorem,"
  (a + bi)ⁿ = rⁿ [cos(nθ) + i sin(nθ)]
  (a − bi)ⁿ = rⁿ [cos(nθ) − i sin(nθ)].
"For these two to be equal, their imaginary parts must cancel. That is, we need"
  sin(nθ) = 0.
Step 3. Determine the condition on n and θ.  
"Since sin(nθ) = 0, we must have"
  nθ = πk  for some integer k.
"Because a and b are positive, we have 0 < θ < π/2. The smallest positive integer solution will occur when k = 1 giving"
  nθ = π ⟹ θ = π/n.
"Now, choose n as the smallest positive integer for which θ = π/n lies in (0, π/2).  "
"• For n = 1, θ = π, which is too large.  "
"• For n = 2, θ = π/2; however, then tan(θ) = tan(π/2) is not defined.  "
"• For n = 3, θ = π/3, which works well."
Step 4. Compute b/a.  
"Since tan θ = b/a and we found θ = π/3, we have"
  b/a = tan(π/3) = √3.
"Thus, the required value of b/a is √3."
