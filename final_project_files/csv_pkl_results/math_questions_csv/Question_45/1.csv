"\[(a + bi)^n = (a - bi)^n,\]compute $\frac{b}{a}.$"
"Teacher: Let’s work through the problem step by step without jumping to the final answer. We want to find, for positive real numbers a and b, and for the smallest positive integer n such that"
  (a + bi)ⁿ = (a − bi)ⁿ
we compute the ratio b/a.
"Step 1: Since a and b are positive, a + bi is a complex number in the first quadrant. A natural first step is to express a + bi in its polar form. In polar form, we write"
"  a + bi = r (cos θ + i sin θ),"
"where r is the modulus and θ is the argument. Similarly, a − bi can be written in polar form. "
Please write a + bi and a − bi in polar form and then describe what happens when you raise these to the power of n. What equation do you get by setting (a + bi)ⁿ equal to (a − bi)ⁿ? (Do just this step. Tell me your work and reasoning.)
Student: Sure! Let's start by expressing \( a + bi \) and \( a - bi \) in polar form.
1. **Finding the modulus \( r \)**:
   The modulus \( r \) of the complex number \( a + bi \) is given by:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
   \]
2. **Finding the argument \( \theta \)**:
   The argument \( \theta \) for \( a + bi \) can be calculated using:
   \[
   \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)
   \]
"   Therefore, we can write:"
   \[
   a + bi = r \left( \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \right)
   \]
3. **For \( a - bi \)**:
   The modulus remains the same:
   \[
   a - bi = r \left( \cos(-\theta) + i \sin(-\theta) \right) = r \left( \cos \theta - i \sin \theta \right)
   \]
"Now, when we raise both \( a + bi \) and \( a - bi \) to the power of \( n \):"
\[
(a + bi)^n = \left( r \left( \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \right) \right)^n = r^n \left( \cos(n\theta) + i \sin(n\theta) \right)
\]
\[
(a - bi)^n = \left( r \left( \cos \theta - i \sin \theta \right) \right)^n = r^n \left( \cos(n\theta) - i \sin(n\theta) \right)
\]
"Now, setting these two expressions equal gives us:"
\[
r^n \left( \cos(n\theta) + i \sin(n\theta) \right) = r^n \left( \cos(n\theta) - i \sin(n\theta) \right)
\]
"Since \( r^n \) is positive and non-zero, we can divide both sides by \( r^n \):"
\[
\cos(n\theta) + i \sin(n\theta) = \cos(n\theta) - i \sin(n\theta)
\]
This leads us to:
\[
i \sin(n\theta) = -i \sin(n\theta)
\]
"From this, we can simplify to:"
\[
2i \sin(n\theta) = 0
\]
"Thus, we find that:"
\[
\sin(n\theta) = 0
\]
This means that \( n\theta \) must be an integer multiple of \( \pi \):
\[
n\theta = k\pi \quad \text{for some integer } k
\]
"Now, since \( \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \), we can substitute to find:"
\[
n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = k\pi
\]
"At this point, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that this holds for positive \( a \) and \( b \). "
Would you like me to continue from here and determine the smallest \( n \)?
Teacher: Great work on converting the expressions into polar form and deriving the equation sin(nθ) = 0. Now we have that
  nθ = kπ    (for some integer k)
with θ = arctan(b/a) where a and b are positive (so 0 < θ < π/2).
"For our next step, please do the following:"
"1. Using nθ = kπ and the fact that 0 < θ < π/2, determine the restrictions on the possible values of k and n."
2. Identify the smallest positive integer n that can work with a corresponding positive integer k.
"3. Then, express θ in terms of n (and k) and finally write b/a = tan θ in that form."
Take your time to work out these ideas and show me your reasoning.
Student: Sure! Let’s analyze the equation \( n\theta = k\pi \) with \( \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \) under the constraints that \( 0 < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2} \).
### Step 1: Determine Restrictions on \( k \) and \( n \)
"Since \( \theta \) is positive and less than \( \frac{\pi}{2} \), we can conclude that:"
\[
0 < n\theta < \frac{n\pi}{2}
\]
This implies that for \( n\theta = k\pi \):
\[
0 < k\pi < \frac{n\pi}{2}
\]
Dividing through by \( \pi \) gives us:
\[
0 < k < \frac{n}{2}
\]
### Step 2: Identify the Smallest Positive Integer \( n \)
"From the inequality \( 0 < k < \frac{n}{2} \), \( k \) must be a positive integer. The smallest value for \( k \) is 1. Therefore, we have:"
\[
1 < \frac{n}{2} \implies n > 2
\]
"Thus, the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies this condition is \( n = 3 \)."
### Step 3: Express \( \theta \) in Terms of \( n \) and \( k \)
"Using \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 1 \), we substitute back into the equation:"
\[
3\theta = \pi \implies \theta = \frac{\pi}{3}
\]
### Step 4: Write \( \frac{b}{a} \) in Terms of \( n \) and \( k \)
Now we can express \( \frac{b}{a} \) in terms of \( \theta \):
\[
\frac{b}{a} = \tan(\theta) = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \sqrt{3}
\]
### Final Answer
"Thus, the ratio \( \frac{b}{a} \) is:"
\[
\frac{b}{a} = \sqrt{3}
\]
Let me know if you would like to discuss any part of this solution further!
Teacher: You've done an excellent job working through the problem step by step. Let's briefly review your reasoning:
"1. You correctly expressed a + bi and a − bi in polar form and raised them to the nth power, arriving at the equation sin(nθ) = 0."
"2. You established that nθ must equal kπ and then, considering that 0 < θ < π/2, deduced that 0 < k < n/2."
"3. By choosing k = 1, you found that the smallest integer n satisfying n > 2 is n = 3."
"4. This led you to determine θ = π/3, so that b/a = tan(π/3) = √3."
"Your reasoning is well-supported at every stage. If everything is clear on your end, please confirm that you are ready to conclude with the final answer."
"Student: Yes, I feel confident in my understanding of the problem and the steps we've taken. "
To summarize:
1. I expressed \( a + bi \) and \( a - bi \) in polar form and derived the equation \( \sin(n\theta) = 0 \).
2. I analyzed the implications of \( n\theta = k\pi \) and determined the restrictions on \( k \) and \( n \).
"3. I identified the smallest positive integer \( n \) to be 3, corresponding to \( k = 1 \)."
"4. Finally, I expressed \( \theta \) in terms of \( n \) and \( k \), leading to \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{3} \), and thus found that \( \frac{b}{a} = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \sqrt{3} \)."
"So, the final answer is:"
\[
\frac{b}{a} = \sqrt{3}
\]
Thank you for your guidance throughout this process!
Teacher: Great work arriving at the final conclusion together! As a quick recap:
1. We expressed a + bi and a − bi in polar form.
"2. We raised both to the nth power, leading to the requirement that sin(nθ) = 0, which implies nθ = kπ."
"3. Given that 0 < θ < π/2, we deduced that k must be 1 for the smallest integer solution, and so n = 3."
"4. Then, solving 3θ = π gave θ = π/3, so that b/a = tan(π/3) = √3."
The final answer is:
√3$
