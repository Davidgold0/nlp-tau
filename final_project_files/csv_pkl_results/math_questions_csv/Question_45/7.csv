Question: If $n$ is the smallest positive integer for which there exist positive real numbers $a$ and $b$ such that_x000D_
"\[(a + bi)^n = (a - bi)^n,\]compute $\frac{b}{a}.$"
3o-mini: Let a + bi be written in polar form as r·e^(iθ) where r > 0 and 0 < θ < π/2 (since a and b are positive). Then its conjugate is a - bi = r·e^(–iθ). Raise both to the nth power:
  (a + bi)ⁿ = rⁿ·e^(i nθ)
  (a – bi)ⁿ = rⁿ·e^(–i nθ)
The given equation (a + bi)ⁿ = (a – bi)ⁿ becomes
  rⁿ·e^(i nθ) = rⁿ·e^(–i nθ).
"Since rⁿ ≠ 0, we have"
  e^(i nθ) = e^(–i nθ).
Multiply both sides by e^(i nθ) to obtain
  e^(2i nθ) = 1.
This equation means that 2nθ must be an integer multiple of 2π:
"  2nθ = 2πk  for some integer k,"
or
  θ = (kπ)/n.
"Because a and b are both positive, the angle θ must lie strictly between 0 and π/2; that is,"
  0 < (kπ)/n < π/2   or  k/n < 1/2.
We are looking for the smallest positive integer n for which some integer k exists with k/n < 1/2 (and k > 0).
"• For n = 1: With k = 1, θ = π, which is too large."
"• For n = 2: With k = 1, θ = π/2, but that corresponds to a = r·cos(θ) = 0, which is not allowed."
"• For n = 3: With k = 1, θ = π/3, which satisfies 0 < π/3 < π/2."
"Thus, the smallest such n is 3."
"Now, since tan θ = b/a, we compute"
  b/a = tan(π/3) = √3.
"Therefore, the answer is √3."
