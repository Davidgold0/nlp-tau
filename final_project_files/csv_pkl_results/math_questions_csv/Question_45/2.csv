Question: If $n$ is the smallest positive integer for which there exist positive real numbers $a$ and $b$ such that_x000D_
"\[(a + bi)^n = (a - bi)^n,\]compute $\frac{b}{a}.$"
Teacher: Let's begin by rephrasing the problem in our own words:
"We are given positive real numbers a and b, and we know that (a + bi)ⁿ equals (a – bi)ⁿ for some positive integer n. Our goal is to find the ratio b/a. One useful approach here is to express a + bi and a – bi in their polar forms. Once in polar form, you can raise them to the power n and then set the two resulting expressions equal. This creates conditions on the angular parts that will eventually help us find b/a."
Here’s a suggested outline of steps:
"1. Express a + bi in polar form, i.e., in terms of r (its magnitude) and θ (its argument). Similarly for a – bi."
2. Use the polar form to compute (a + bi)ⁿ and (a – bi)ⁿ.
3. Set these two expressions equal and analyze what condition must hold for the angles.
"4. Since a and b are positive, determine the range of θ."
5. Find the smallest positive integer n such that the conditions on the angle can be satisfied.
6. Use the value of θ found through that condition to compute b/a (hint: b/a = tan θ).
Let's start with the first step. Can you express a + bi (and similarly a – bi) in polar form? Please provide your reasoning and your answer for this step.
"Student: Sure! To express \( a + bi \) and \( a - bi \) in polar form, we need to find their magnitudes and arguments."
1. **Magnitude**: The magnitude \( r \) of both \( a + bi \) and \( a - bi \) is given by:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
   \]
2. **Argument**: The argument \( \theta \) for \( a + bi \) can be found using the arctangent function:
   \[
   \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)
   \]
"   For \( a - bi \), the argument is:"
   \[
   -\theta = -\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)
   \]
Now we can express both numbers in polar form:
- For \( a + bi \):
  \[
  a + bi = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \left( \cos\left(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\right) + i \sin\left(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\right) \right)
  \]
- For \( a - bi \):
  \[
  a - bi = r(\cos(-\theta) + i \sin(-\theta)) = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \left( \cos\left(-\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\right) + i \sin\left(-\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\right) \right)
  \]
"Now that we have the polar forms, we can move on to the next step of raising them to the power \( n \) and setting the two expressions equal. Would you like me to proceed with that?"
Teacher: Great work on expressing a + bi and a – bi in polar form! Now let's move to the next step.
"Step 2: Raise both expressions to the power n. Remember that if you have a complex number in polar form, r(cos θ + i sin θ), then raising it to the power n gives you rⁿ[cis(nθ)] where cis(θ) means cos θ + i sin θ."
"Could you help by writing down (a + bi)ⁿ and (a – bi)ⁿ in polar form, using this idea, and then set them equal? Please provide just this next step with your reasoning."
Student: Sure! Let's raise both expressions \( a + bi \) and \( a - bi \) to the power \( n \) using the polar form we derived earlier.
1. **Expression for \( (a + bi)^n \)**:
   \[
   (a + bi)^n = \left( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \right)^n \left( \cos(n\theta) + i \sin(n\theta) \right) = (a^2 + b^2)^{n/2} \left( \cos\left(n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\right) + i \sin\left(n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\right) \right)
   \]
2. **Expression for \( (a - bi)^n \)**:
   \[
   (a - bi)^n = \left( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \right)^n \left( \cos(-n\theta) + i \sin(-n\theta) \right) = (a^2 + b^2)^{n/2} \left( \cos\left(-n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\right) + i \sin\left(-n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\right) \right)
   \]
"Now, we need to set these two expressions equal to each other:"
\[
(a^2 + b^2)^{n/2} \left( \cos\left(n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\right) + i \sin\left(n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\right) \right) = (a^2 + b^2)^{n/2} \left( \cos\left(-n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\right) + i \sin\left(-n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\right) \right)
\]
"Since the magnitudes \( (a^2 + b^2)^{n/2} \) are equal and positive, we can focus on the angular parts:"
\[
\cos\left(n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\right) + i \sin\left(n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\right) = \cos\left(-n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\right) + i \sin\left(-n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\right)
\]
This leads us to the condition:
\[
n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = -n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) + 2k\pi \quad \text{for some integer } k
\]
Would you like me to simplify this condition further to find \( n \) and eventually \( \frac{b}{a} \)?
Teacher: Great job on setting up the equation! Now we move to the next step.
Step 3: We have the angular condition from setting the expressions equal:
  n · tan⁻¹(b/a) = - n · tan⁻¹(b/a) + 2πk  for some integer k.
"Simplify this equation and solve for tan⁻¹(b/a). In other words, show that the equation becomes"
  n · tan⁻¹(b/a) = πk.
"Now, keeping in mind that a and b are positive (so the angle tan⁻¹(b/a) lies between 0 and π/2), choose an appropriate value for k and find the smallest positive integer n for which the equation can hold without forcing an impossible angle. Finally, express b/a as a function of n and k (hint: you’ll need to use the tangent function)."
Could you work through this step and share your reasoning and findings?
Student: Sure! Let's simplify the equation we derived:
\[
n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = -n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) + 2k\pi
\]
We can combine the terms on the left side:
\[
n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) + n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = 2k\pi
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = 2k\pi
\]
Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:
\[
n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = k\pi
\]
"Now, we can express \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\) as:"
\[
\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = \frac{k\pi}{n}
\]
"Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)\) lies between 0 and \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). This means:"
\[
0 < \frac{k\pi}{n} < \frac{\pi}{2}
\]
"From this inequality, we can derive:"
\[
0 < k < \frac{n}{2}
\]
The smallest integer \(n\) that satisfies this condition while keeping \(k\) a positive integer is \(n = 2\) and \(k = 1\). Substituting \(n = 2\) and \(k = 1\) into our expression gives:
\[
\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2}
\]
This means:
\[
\frac{b}{a} = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)
\]
"However, \(\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\) is undefined, so we must consider the next smallest \(n\) that allows for a valid angle. If we take \(k = 1\) and \(n = 4\), we have:"
\[
\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = \frac{\pi}{4}
\]
"Thus, we find:"
\[
\frac{b}{a} = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = 1
\]
"So, the ratio \(\frac{b}{a} = 1\)."
"To summarize, the smallest positive integer \(n\) for which the condition holds is \(n = 4\) and the computed ratio is:"
\[
\frac{b}{a} = 1
\]
"Would you like me to clarify anything further, or should we finalize this answer?"
Teacher: You've made a good start in simplifying the equation. Now let's carefully reexamine the condition:
We arrived at
  n · tan⁻¹(b/a) = πk.
"Since b and a are positive, tan⁻¹(b/a) is strictly between 0 and π/2. This implies"
  0 < (πk)/n < π/2  or  0 < k/n < 1/2.
"Now, we need to choose k and n so that k/n is less than 1/2 and n is as small as possible (with k being a positive integer). "
"You suggested n = 4 with k = 1, which gives (1/4) < 1/2. However, is n = 4 the smallest positive integer that works? "
Look at k = 1 and ask: what happens if n = 2 or n = 3?
Remember: 
"– For n = 2, k = 1 would give 1/2, but the inequality must be strict (k/n must be less than 1/2)—because if tan⁻¹(b/a) = π/2, then b/a becomes tan(π/2), which is undefined. "
– Now consider n = 3 with k = 1. Does that satisfy 0 < 1/3 < 1/2?
"Take a moment and check: For n = 3 and k = 1, what would tan⁻¹(b/a) equal? And what would b/a equal when you express it in terms of the tangent function? Please solve this specific part."
Student: Let's evaluate the condition for \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 1 \):
"From our earlier equation, we have:"
\[
n \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = k\pi.
\]
"Substituting \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 1 \), we get:"
\[
3 \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = \pi.
\]
Dividing both sides by 3 gives:
\[
\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = \frac{\pi}{3}.
\]
"Now, we can find \( \frac{b}{a} \) by taking the tangent of both sides:"
\[
\frac{b}{a} = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right).
\]
We know that:
\[
\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \sqrt{3}.
\]
"Thus, we conclude:"
\[
\frac{b}{a} = \sqrt{3}.
\]
"Now, we've determined that for \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 1 \), the ratio \( \frac{b}{a} \) is \( \sqrt{3} \), and this satisfies the condition \( 0 < \frac{1}{3} < \frac{1}{2} \)."
"So the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which the condition holds is indeed \( n = 3 \), and the computed ratio is:"
\[
\frac{b}{a} = \sqrt{3}.
\]
Thank you for your guidance! Is there anything else you would like me to clarify or do?
Teacher: You've done an excellent job working through the simplification! Let's quickly review:
1. We obtained the angular condition n·tan⁻¹(b/a) = πk.
"2. Since tan⁻¹(b/a) lies in (0, π/2), we need 0 < k/n < 1/2."
"3. For n = 3 and k = 1, the inequality holds because 1/3 < 1/2."
"4. In that case, tan⁻¹(b/a) = π/3, so b/a = tan(π/3) = √3."
This is the correct way to reach the answer. 
√3$
