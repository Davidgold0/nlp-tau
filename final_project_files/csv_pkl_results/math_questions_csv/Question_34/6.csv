"Question: Suppose that I have an unlimited supply of identical math books, history books, and physics books.  All are the same size, and I have room on a shelf for 8 books.  In how many ways can I arrange eight books on the shelf if no two books of the same type can be adjacent?"
"3o-mini: We have three types of books: math (M), history (H), and physics (P). We want to arrange 8 books in a row on a shelf, and the restriction is that no two adjacent books can be of the same type."
"Step 1. For the first book we can choose any of the three types, so there are 3 choices."
"Step 2. For each subsequent book, we can choose any of the two remaining types (one that is not the same as the book immediately preceding it), which gives us 2 choices for each of the remaining 7 positions."
"Thus, the total number of arrangements is:"
  3 × 2^7 = 3 × 128 = 384
"So, there are 384 ways to arrange the 8 books on the shelf with no two adjacent being of the same type."
