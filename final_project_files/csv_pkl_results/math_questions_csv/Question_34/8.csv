"Question: Suppose that I have an unlimited supply of identical math books, history books, and physics books.  All are the same size, and I have room on a shelf for 8 books.  In how many ways can I arrange eight books on the shelf if no two books of the same type can be adjacent?"
"3o-mini: To solve the problem, consider arranging the books as a sequence of 8 positions, where each position is filled with a book type (Math, History, or Physics) under the constraint that no two consecutive books are of the same type."
"Step 1: Choose the book for the first position. Since there are 3 types available, there are 3 possible choices."
"Step 2: For each subsequent position (positions 2 through 8), the book type must differ from that of the immediately preceding position. This means that for any position after the first, there are 2 choices."
Step 3: Multiply the number of choices together to get the total arrangements:
  Number of arrangements = 3 (for the first book) × 2^7 (for the remaining 7 books).
"Calculating that,"
"  2^7 = 128,"
  3 × 128 = 384.
"Thus, there are 384 ways to arrange the eight books on the shelf under the given constraints."
