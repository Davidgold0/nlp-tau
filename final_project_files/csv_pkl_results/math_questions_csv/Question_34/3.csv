"Question: Suppose that I have an unlimited supply of identical math books, history books, and physics books.  All are the same size, and I have room on a shelf for 8 books.  In how many ways can I arrange eight books on the shelf if no two books of the same type can be adjacent?"
"Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem together. We have three types of books (math, history, physics) available in unlimited supply, and we need to arrange eight books on a shelf with the rule that no two adjacent books are of the same type."
Here’s an outline of the steps we might take:
1. Determine the number of choices for the first book on the shelf.
"2. For each subsequent book (positions 2 through 8), decide how many choices you have given that it must be different from the book immediately before it."
3. Set up an expression that multiplies these choices together to get the total number of valid arrangements.
Let’s start with the first step.
"Step 1: How many choices do you have for the first book on the shelf? Please solve just this step, and then we’ll review your answer."
"Student: For the first book on the shelf, I have three choices because I can choose either a math book, a history book, or a physics book. So, the number of choices for the first book is 3. "
Is that correct?
Teacher: You're exactly right! There are 3 choices for the first book because it can be any one of the three types.
"Now let’s move to the second step: For the second book on the shelf, what choices do you have, given that it must be different from the first book? Please think about it and tell me your answer for just this step."
"Student: Student: For the second book on the shelf, I can only choose from the two types of books that are different from the first book. Since there are three types of books in total, and I can't use the type of the first book, I have 2 choices for the second book."
Is that correct?
"Teacher: That's absolutely correct! For the second book, you indeed have 2 choices because it must be a different type than the first."
Now let's move on to the next step together.
"Think about the third book on the shelf. Remember, the only restriction is that its type must be different from the type of the second book (regardless of what was chosen for the first). "
"Step 3: How many choices do you have for the third book? Please solve this step, and then we'll review your answer."
"Student: Student: For the third book on the shelf, I again have 2 choices. This is because the third book must be different from the second book, but it can be the same type as the first book. Since there are still three types of books available, and I just need to avoid the type of the second book, I have 2 choices for the third book."
Is that correct?
"Teacher: That's absolutely correct! For the third book, you have 2 choices since it only needs to be different from the book immediately before it."
"Now, let's move on to the next step. Think about the fourth book on the shelf. Considering that the only restriction is that the fourth book must be different from the third book, what would be the number of choices for the fourth book? Please solve just this step, and then we'll review your answer."
"Student: Student: For the fourth book on the shelf, I also have 2 choices. This is because the fourth book must be different from the type of the third book, but it can be the same as either the first or the second book. Since there are still three types of books available, and I just need to avoid the type of the third book, I have 2 choices for the fourth book."
Is that correct?
"Teacher: You're right! For the fourth book, since it must be different from the third book, there are indeed 2 choices. Excellent job!"
"Now, let's move to the next step together. Think about the fifth book on the shelf. Remember, the only restriction is that the fifth book must be different from the fourth book. What do you think is the number of choices for the fifth book? Please solve just this step, and then we'll review your answer."
"Student: Student: For the fifth book on the shelf, I again have 2 choices. This is because the fifth book must be different from the type of the fourth book, but it can be the same type as either the first, second, or third books. Since there are still three types of books available, and I just need to avoid the type of the fourth book, I have 2 choices for the fifth book."
Is that correct?
"Teacher: That's exactly right! For the fifth book, you indeed have 2 choices because it only needs to be different from the fourth book."
"Now, let's move to the next step. Think about the sixth book on the shelf. What are the choices for the sixth book, given that its only restriction is that it must be different from the fifth book? Please solve this step, and then we'll review your answer."
"Student: Student: For the sixth book on the shelf, I again have 2 choices. This is because the sixth book must be different from the type of the fifth book, but it can be the same type as any of the previous books (first through fourth). Since there are still three types of books available, and I just need to avoid the type of the fifth book, I have 2 choices for the sixth book."
Is that correct?
"Teacher: That's correct! For the sixth book, you have 2 choices because it only needs to be different from the fifth book."
"Now, let's move on to the next step."
"Think about the seventh book on the shelf. Remember, the only restriction is that the seventh book must be different from the sixth book. What do you think is the number of choices for the seventh book? Please solve just that step, and then we'll review your answer."
"Student: Student: For the seventh book on the shelf, I again have 2 choices. This is because the seventh book must be different from the type of the sixth book, but it can be the same type as any of the previous books (first through fifth). Since there are still three types of books available, and I just need to avoid the type of the sixth book, I have 2 choices for the seventh book."
Is that correct?
"Teacher: You're absolutely correct! For the seventh book, since it only needs to differ from the sixth book, you indeed have 2 choices."
Now let's move on to the next step:
"Step 8: Consider the eighth (final) book on the shelf. Given that it must be different from the seventh book, how many choices do you have for the eighth book? Please solve just this step, and then we'll review your answer."
"Student: Student: For the eighth book on the shelf, I again have 2 choices. This is because the eighth book must be different from the type of the seventh book, but it can be the same type as any of the previous books (first through sixth). Since there are still three types of books available, and I just need to avoid the type of the seventh book, I have 2 choices for the eighth book."
Is that correct?
"Teacher: That's absolutely correct! For the eighth book, you indeed have 2 choices since it only needs to be different from the seventh book."
"Now that we've found the number of choices for each book, let's combine all of the steps together to get the total number of valid arrangements for the 8 books. Based on your previous answers, what expression would you use to represent the total number of arrangements? Please solve just this next step and share your reasoning."
"Student: Student: To find the total number of valid arrangements for the 8 books on the shelf, we combine the choices we made for each book. "
"1. For the first book, I have 3 choices."
"2. For each of the subsequent books (from the second to the eighth), I have 2 choices."
"So, the total number of arrangements can be represented as:"
\[ 
\text{Total arrangements} = 3 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 
\]
This simplifies to:
\[ 
\text{Total arrangements} = 3 \times 2^7 
\]
"Now, I can calculate \( 2^7 \):"
\[ 
2^7 = 128 
\]
"Therefore, the total number of arrangements is:"
\[ 
3 \times 128 = 384 
\]
"So, the total number of valid arrangements for the 8 books on the shelf is 384. "
Is that correct?
Teacher: Great work! You've correctly deduced that the total number of valid arrangements is given by 3 choices for the first book multiplied by 2 choices for each of the remaining 7 books. That is:
3 × 2^7 = 3 × 128 = 384$
Excellent job working through each step!
Student: Thank you! I'm glad I was able to work through the problem step by step. To summarize:
"1. For the first book, I had 3 choices (math, history, or physics)."
"2. For each of the subsequent books (from the second to the eighth), I had 2 choices since each book must be different from the one immediately before it."
"So, the total number of valid arrangements can be expressed as:"
\[
\text{Total arrangements} = 3 \times 2^7
\]
"Calculating \(2^7\) gives us 128, and multiplying that by 3 results in:"
\[
3 \times 128 = 384
\]
"Thus, the total number of valid arrangements for the 8 books on the shelf is **384**. "
Thank you for guiding me through the problem!
"Teacher: Excellent work summarizing the key points! You correctly identified that we have 3 choices for the first book and 2 choices for each subsequent book (from the second to the eighth). Multiplying these choices together gives us the expression 3 × 2⁷. Since 2⁷ equals 128, the total number of arrangements is 3 × 128, which equals 384."
