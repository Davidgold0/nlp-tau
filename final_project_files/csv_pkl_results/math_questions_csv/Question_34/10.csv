"Question: Suppose that I have an unlimited supply of identical math books, history books, and physics books.  All are the same size, and I have room on a shelf for 8 books.  In how many ways can I arrange eight books on the shelf if no two books of the same type can be adjacent?"
"3o-mini: We have three types of books: math, history, and physics. We want to arrange eight books on a shelf so that no two adjacent books are the same type."
Step 1: Choose the first book.  
"Since there are no restrictions on the first book, there are 3 choices."
"Step 2: For each subsequent book (positions 2 through 8), you cannot use the same type as the book immediately to its left. That gives 2 choices for each of these 7 positions."
Step 3: Multiply the number of choices for each position.  
Total arrangements = 3 × (2^7) = 3 × 128 = 384.
"So, there are 384 ways to arrange the eight books under the given condition."
