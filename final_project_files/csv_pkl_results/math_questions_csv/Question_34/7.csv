"Question: Suppose that I have an unlimited supply of identical math books, history books, and physics books.  All are the same size, and I have room on a shelf for 8 books.  In how many ways can I arrange eight books on the shelf if no two books of the same type can be adjacent?"
"3o-mini: We need to fill 8 positions on a shelf with books chosen from three types: math, history, and physics. The only restriction is that no two adjacent books can be of the same type."
"Step 1. For the first position, any of the three types can be chosen. This gives 3 possibilities."
"Step 2. For every subsequent position (positions 2 through 8), the book must be different from the one immediately to its left, so there are 2 choices for each position."
"Thus, the total number of ways to arrange the books is:"
  3 × 2^7 = 3 × 128 = 384
"So, there are 384 possible arrangements."
