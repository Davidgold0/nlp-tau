"Question: Suppose that I have an unlimited supply of identical math books, history books, and physics books.  All are the same size, and I have room on a shelf for 8 books.  In how many ways can I arrange eight books on the shelf if no two books of the same type can be adjacent?"
"3o-mini: There are 3 choices for the first book (math, history, or physics). For each subsequent book, you cannot choose the type that was just placed, so you have 2 choices for each. Thus, the total number of arrangements is:"
  3 × 2^7 = 3 × 128 = 384 ways.
