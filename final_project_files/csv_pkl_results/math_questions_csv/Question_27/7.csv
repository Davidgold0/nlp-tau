"Question: A class of 25 students includes the Smith quadruplets.  The teacher must select two students from the class to represent the class in the school's student government.  Instead of holding an election, the teacher decides to choose the two representatives at random.  What is the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets?"
"3o-mini: There are 25 students in the class, with 4 of them being Smith quadruplets. The total number of ways to choose any 2 students from the class is given by the combination C(25, 2), which equals 300."
"The number of ways to choose 2 students who are both Smith quadruplets is given by C(4, 2), which equals 6."
"Thus, the probability that both selected students are Smith quadruplets is 6/300, which simplifies to 1/50."
The final answer is 1/50.
