"Question: A class of 25 students includes the Smith quadruplets.  The teacher must select two students from the class to represent the class in the school's student government.  Instead of holding an election, the teacher decides to choose the two representatives at random.  What is the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets?"
"3o-mini: To find the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets, we first determine the total number of ways to choose any 2 students from the 25, which is given by the combination formula C(25, 2)."
"C(25, 2) = 25 × 24 / 2 = 300"
"Next, we determine the number of ways to choose 2 students from the 4 Smith quadruplets."
"C(4, 2) = 4 × 3 / 2 = 6"
The desired probability is the ratio of the favorable outcomes to the total outcomes:
Probability = 6 / 300 = 1/50
"Thus, the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets is 1/50."
