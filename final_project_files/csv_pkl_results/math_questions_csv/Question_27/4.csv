"Question: A class of 25 students includes the Smith quadruplets.  The teacher must select two students from the class to represent the class in the school's student government.  Instead of holding an election, the teacher decides to choose the two representatives at random.  What is the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets?"
Teacher: Let's break down the problem together without jumping straight into the final answer. Here’s an outline of the steps we need to take to solve the problem:
1. We need to calculate the total number of ways to select any 2 students from the class of 25.
"2. Next, we need to determine the number of ways to select 2 students from just the group of Smith quadruplets."
"3. Finally, the probability that the teacher selects 2 Smith quadruplets is the ratio of the number of successful outcomes (step 2) to the total number of outcomes (step 1)."
Let’s start with the first step:
Step 1: Find the total number of pairs that can be formed by choosing 2 students out of 25. Can you tell me what formula you would use and then compute that value?
"Student: To find the total number of ways to select 2 students from a class of 25, we can use the combination formula, which is given by:"
\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
\]
"In this case, \( n = 25 \) (the total number of students) and \( r = 2 \) (the number of students we want to select). "
"So, we can calculate:"
\[
\binom{25}{2} = \frac{25!}{2!(25 - 2)!} = \frac{25!}{2! \cdot 23!}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\binom{25}{2} = \frac{25 \times 24}{2 \times 1} = \frac{600}{2} = 300
\]
"Therefore, the total number of ways to select 2 students from the class of 25 is **300**. "
Would you like me to proceed to step 2?
Teacher: Great job on step 1! You've correctly determined that there are 300 ways to select 2 students from 25. Now let's move on to step 2.
"Step 2: We need to find the number of ways to select 2 students out of the 4 Smith quadruplets. Which formula would you use here, and what does this calculation give you?"
Please show your work for this step.
"Student: To find the number of ways to select 2 students from the 4 Smith quadruplets, we will again use the combination formula:"
\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
\]
"In this case, \( n = 4 \) (the number of Smith quadruplets) and \( r = 2 \) (the number of students we want to select)."
So we calculate:
\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = \frac{4!}{2! \cdot 2!}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
\]
"Therefore, the number of ways to select 2 students from the 4 Smith quadruplets is **6**."
Would you like me to proceed to step 3?
Teacher: Excellent work on step 2! You've correctly calculated that there are 6 ways to choose 2 quadruplets from the 4 available.
"Now, let’s move on to step 3:"
Step 3: Use the results from step 1 and step 2 to determine the probability that both chosen representatives are Smith quadruplets. Can you show me how you would set up this probability expression and simplify it?
"Student: Student: To find the probability that both chosen representatives are Smith quadruplets, we can use the results from step 1 and step 2."
The probability \( P \) is given by the ratio of the number of successful outcomes (selecting 2 Smith quadruplets) to the total number of outcomes (selecting any 2 students from the class). 
"So, the probability can be expressed as:"
\[
P = \frac{\text{Number of ways to choose 2 quadruplets}}{\text{Total number of ways to choose 2 students}} = \frac{\binom{4}{2}}{\binom{25}{2}}
\]
Substituting the values we calculated:
\[
P = \frac{6}{300}
\]
"Now, we can simplify this fraction:"
\[
P = \frac{6 \div 6}{300 \div 6} = \frac{1}{50}
\]
"Therefore, the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets is **\(\frac{1}{50}\)**. "
Does this look correct to you?
"Teacher: You've done an excellent job! Your setup for the probability was perfectly correct. You've shown that the probability is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (selecting 2 Smith quadruplets) to the total number of outcomes (selecting any 2 students), which leads to:"
  P = 6/300 = 1/50
Everything looks correct. 
To summarize our discussion:  
1. We determined that there are 300 ways to select 2 students from 25.  
2. We found 6 ways to choose 2 quadruplets from 4.  
"3. Setting up the ratio gave us 6/300, which simplifies to 1/50."
The final answer is 1/50$
