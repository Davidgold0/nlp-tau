"Question: A class of 25 students includes the Smith quadruplets.  The teacher must select two students from the class to represent the class in the school's student government.  Instead of holding an election, the teacher decides to choose the two representatives at random.  What is the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets?"
Teacher: Let's break down the problem into a few clear steps:
"1. Identify the total number of ways to choose 2 students from the class of 25. (Hint: use the combination formula, often written as ""n choose k"".)"
2. Determine the number of ways to choose 2 students from the Smith quadruplets.
3. Set up the probability as the ratio of the number of ways to choose the quadruplets to the total number of ways to choose any 2 students.
4. Simplify the ratio to get the final probability.
Let's start with the first step: How many ways can you choose 2 students from the whole class of 25? Please calculate that using the combination formula.
"Student: To find the number of ways to choose 2 students from a class of 25, I will use the combination formula, which is written as \( \binom{n}{k} \) where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, and \( k \) is the number of items to choose. "
"In this case, \( n = 25 \) and \( k = 2 \). The formula for combinations is:"
\[
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]
"So, substituting in the values:"
\[
\binom{25}{2} = \frac{25!}{2!(25-2)!} = \frac{25!}{2! \cdot 23!}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\binom{25}{2} = \frac{25 \times 24}{2 \times 1} = \frac{600}{2} = 300
\]
"Therefore, there are 300 ways to choose 2 students from the class of 25. "
"Is that correct, Teacher?"
Teacher: That's correct! You've successfully calculated that there are 300 ways to choose 2 students from 25.
"Now, let's move on to the next step: Calculate how many ways you can choose 2 students from the 4 Smith quadruplets. Please work on that step and share your calculation."
"Student: To find the number of ways to choose 2 students from the 4 Smith quadruplets, I will again use the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \)."
"In this case, \( n = 4 \) (the number of quadruplets) and \( k = 2 \) (the number of students we want to choose). "
Using the combination formula:
\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4!}{2! \cdot 2!}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
\]
"Therefore, there are 6 ways to choose 2 students from the 4 Smith quadruplets."
"Is that correct, Teacher?"
Teacher: Great job on calculating the ways to choose 2 quadruplets! You correctly found there are 6 ways.
Now let's move on to the final step: setting up the probability. You'll want to find the probability that both representatives are Smith quadruplets by dividing the number of ways to choose 2 quadruplets (6) by the total number of ways to choose 2 students from all 25 (300). 
"How would you set up this probability expression, and what would it simplify to? Please work on this step and share your answer."
"Student: To find the probability that both representatives are Smith quadruplets, I will set up the probability expression as follows:"
\[
P(\text{both representatives are Smith quadruplets}) = \frac{\text{Number of ways to choose 2 quadruplets}}{\text{Total number of ways to choose 2 students}}
\]
Substituting in the values we calculated:
\[
P(\text{both representatives are Smith quadruplets}) = \frac{6}{300}
\]
"Now, I will simplify the fraction:"
\[
\frac{6}{300} = \frac{1}{50}
\]
"Thus, the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets is "
\[
\frac{1}{50}.
\]
"Is that correct, Teacher?"
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly set up the probability as the number of favorable outcomes (6 ways to choose two quadruplets) divided by the total number of outcomes (300 ways to choose any two students). Your simplification to 6/300 = 1/50 is spot on.
You've reached the final answer. Please confirm that your final answer is:
1/50$
