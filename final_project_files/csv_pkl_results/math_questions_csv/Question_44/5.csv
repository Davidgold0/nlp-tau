Question: Find all values of $k$ so that_x000D_
\[x^2 - (k - 3) x - k + 6 > 0\]for all $x.$
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem in our own words. We are given the quadratic inequality
"  x² – (k – 3)x – k + 6 > 0  for all x,"
and we need to find all values of k for which this inequality holds for every real x.
"To tackle this problem step by step, here’s an outline of our approach:"
"1. Write the quadratic in standard form, identifying the coefficients A, B, and C."
2. Recall that a quadratic f(x) = Ax² + Bx + C is positive for all x if:
"  a. A > 0,"
  b. And its discriminant (B² – 4AC) is less than 0.
"3. Identify A, B, and C from the given quadratic expression."
"4. Use these coefficients to form the discriminant, set it < 0, and solve for k."
"Let’s begin with Step 1: Could you please identify and write down the coefficients A, B, and C for our quadratic equation?"
Student: Sure! Let's start by rewriting the quadratic inequality in standard form:
\[
x^2 - (k - 3)x - (k - 6) > 0
\]
"From this expression, we can identify the coefficients:"
"- \(A = 1\) (the coefficient of \(x^2\)),"
"- \(B = -(k - 3)\) (the coefficient of \(x\)),"
- \(C = -k + 6\) (the constant term).
"So, we have:"
- \(A = 1\)
- \(B = -(k - 3) = -k + 3\)
- \(C = -k + 6\)
"Now that we have identified the coefficients, what should we do next?"
"Teacher: Great work identifying the coefficients correctly! Now that we have A = 1, B = -k + 3, and C = -k + 6, let's move on to the next step."
"Remember that for a quadratic function f(x) = Ax² + Bx + C to be positive for all x, we need:"
" 1. A > 0, and"
" 2. The discriminant, D = B² – 4AC, must be less than 0."
"We already see that A = 1, so the first condition A > 0 is satisfied. "
"Now, could you please calculate the discriminant D = B² – 4AC in terms of k? Once you have that expression, set up the inequality D < 0."
Let me know your work on this step.
Student: Sure! Let's calculate the discriminant \(D\) using the coefficients we identified:
1. **Calculate \(B^2\)**:
   \[
   B^2 = (-k + 3)^2 = (k - 3)^2
   \]
2. **Calculate \(4AC\)**:
"   Since \(A = 1\) and \(C = -k + 6\), we have:"
   \[
   4AC = 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-k + 6) = -4k + 24
   \]
3. **Set up the discriminant**:
   Now we can write the discriminant \(D\):
   \[
   D = B^2 - 4AC = (k - 3)^2 - (-4k + 24)
   \]
   Simplifying this:
   \[
   D = (k - 3)^2 + 4k - 24
   \]
4. **Expand \(D\)**:
   \[
   D = (k^2 - 6k + 9) + 4k - 24 = k^2 - 2k - 15
   \]
Now we need to set up the inequality \(D < 0\):
\[
k^2 - 2k - 15 < 0
\]
What should we do next to solve this inequality?
Teacher: Excellent work so far! We now have the inequality
  k² – 2k – 15 < 0.
"The next step is to solve this quadratic inequality. Typically, you can do this by factoring the quadratic expression to find its roots. Once you have the roots, you can determine the interval(s) where the expression is negative."
"Could you please factor the quadratic k² – 2k – 15, find the roots, and then describe which values of k will make the expression negative? Take your time, and let’s work through this next step together."
Student: Student: Alright! Let's start by factoring the quadratic expression \(k^2 - 2k - 15\).
"To factor this, we need to find two numbers that multiply to \(-15\) (the constant term) and add up to \(-2\) (the coefficient of \(k\)). The numbers \(-5\) and \(3\) work, since:"
\[
-5 \times 3 = -15 \quad \text{and} \quad -5 + 3 = -2.
\]
So we can factor the quadratic as:
\[
(k - 5)(k + 3) < 0.
\]
"Next, we need to find the roots of the equation \(k^2 - 2k - 15 = 0\), which are \(k = 5\) and \(k = -3\). "
"Now, we can analyze the intervals determined by these roots: "
1. \(k < -3\)
2. \(-3 < k < 5\)
3. \(k > 5\)
"To determine where the expression \((k - 5)(k + 3)\) is negative, we can test a value from each interval:"
- For \(k < -3\) (let's test \(k = -4\)):
  \[
  (-4 - 5)(-4 + 3) = (-9)(-1) = 9 \quad (\text{positive})
  \]
- For \(-3 < k < 5\) (let's test \(k = 0\)):
  \[
  (0 - 5)(0 + 3) = (-5)(3) = -15 \quad (\text{negative})
  \]
- For \(k > 5\) (let's test \(k = 6\)):
  \[
  (6 - 5)(6 + 3) = (1)(9) = 9 \quad (\text{positive})
  \]
"From this analysis, we find that the expression \((k - 5)(k + 3) < 0\) in the interval:"
\[
-3 < k < 5.
\]
So the values of \(k\) that satisfy the original quadratic inequality \(x^2 - (k - 3)x - k + 6 > 0\) for all \(x\) are:
\[
"\boxed{(-3, 5)}."
\]
Is there anything else you would like to discuss or clarify regarding this solution?
"Teacher: Excellent work throughout! Your process of rewriting the quadratic, determining its coefficients, calculating the discriminant, and solving the inequality step by step was spot on."
To summarize:
"1. You correctly rewrote the inequality in standard form and identified A = 1, B = -k + 3, C = -k + 6."
"2. You computed the discriminant: D = (k - 3)² + 4k – 24, which simplifies to k² – 2k – 15."
"3. You factored the quadratic as (k – 5)(k + 3) and determined that for k² – 2k – 15 < 0, the interval is –3 < k < 5."
Your final answer is:
"(-3,5)$"
