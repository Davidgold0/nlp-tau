Question: Find all values of $k$ so that_x000D_
\[x^2 - (k - 3) x - k + 6 > 0\]for all $x.$
Teacher: Let's start by rephrasing the problem in our own words:
We are given the quadratic expression  
  f(x) = x² – (k – 3)x – k + 6  
and we need to find all values of k such that f(x) is greater than 0 for every real x.
"One key idea for quadratic functions is that if a quadratic in the form ax² + bx + c is to be positive for all x, it must have a positive leading coefficient (a > 0) and its discriminant must be negative (so that it has no real roots)."
Step 1: Identify the necessary conditions for f(x) to be positive for every x based on its general form. What do you think are the conditions in terms of the coefficient a and the discriminant? Please share your thoughts on this step.
"Student: To ensure that the quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 - (k - 3)x - (k - 6) \) is positive for all values of \( x \), we need to consider two conditions:"
"1. **Positive Leading Coefficient**: The coefficient of \( x^2 \) (which is 1 in this case) must be greater than 0. Since 1 is always positive, this condition is already satisfied."
2. **Negative Discriminant**: The discriminant of the quadratic must be less than 0 to ensure there are no real roots. The discriminant \( D \) for a quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c \) is given by \( D = b^2 - 4ac \).
In our case:
- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = -(k - 3) = 3 - k \)
- \( c = -k + 6 \)
"So, the discriminant \( D \) becomes:"
\[
D = (3 - k)^2 - 4(1)(-k + 6)
\]
"Now, we need to set up the inequality \( D < 0 \) and solve for \( k \). What do you think we should do next?"
"Teacher: Great job outlining the conditions and correctly identifying a = 1, b = 3 - k, and c = -k + 6! Now that we have the inequality for the discriminant, the next step is to simplify it and solve:"
"You need to expand (3 - k)², then subtract 4(–k + 6), and set the entire expression less than 0."
"Please simplify (3 - k)², then write the full inequality in terms of k, and solve for k (just the next step here). What's your work on this step?"
Student: Student: Thank you for the guidance! Let's simplify the discriminant step by step.
"First, we expand \((3 - k)^2\):"
\[
(3 - k)^2 = 9 - 6k + k^2.
\]
"Next, we calculate \( -4(-k + 6) \):"
\[
-4(-k + 6) = 4k - 24.
\]
"Now, we can combine these results to set up the inequality:"
\[
D = (3 - k)^2 - 4(-k + 6) = (9 - 6k + k^2) + (4k - 24).
\]
Combining like terms gives us:
\[
D = k^2 - 2k - 15.
\]
Now we set the inequality:
\[
k^2 - 2k - 15 < 0.
\]
The next step is to factor the quadratic \( k^2 - 2k - 15 \). Let's do that:
\[
k^2 - 2k - 15 = (k - 5)(k + 3).
\]
Now we can express the inequality as:
\[
(k - 5)(k + 3) < 0.
\]
"To solve this inequality, we need to find the intervals where the product is negative. The critical points are \( k = 5 \) and \( k = -3 \). "
"Now, we can test the intervals:"
"1. For \( k < -3 \), say \( k = -4 \): \((-4 - 5)(-4 + 3) = (-9)(-1) > 0\)."
"2. For \( -3 < k < 5 \), say \( k = 0 \): \((0 - 5)(0 + 3) = (-5)(3) < 0\)."
"3. For \( k > 5 \), say \( k = 6 \): \((6 - 5)(6 + 3) = (1)(9) > 0\)."
"Thus, the solution to the inequality \((k - 5)(k + 3) < 0\) is:"
\[
-3 < k < 5.
\]
"So, the values of \( k \) for which \( f(x) > 0 \) for all \( x \) are in the interval \( (-3, 5) \). "
Is this the correct approach?
"Teacher: Great work! Your algebraic manipulation and factorization are both correct. You've simplified the discriminant to k² – 2k – 15, factored it as (k – 5)(k + 3), and correctly determined that (k – 5)(k + 3) < 0 when –3 < k < 5."
"Before we finalize our answer, could you explain why having a negative discriminant (with a positive leading coefficient) guarantees that f(x) is positive for all x? Please share your explanation for this final step."
Student: Student: Absolutely! The reason why having a negative discriminant along with a positive leading coefficient guarantees that the quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 - (k - 3)x - (k - 6) \) is positive for all \( x \) is as follows:
"1. **Positive Leading Coefficient**: The leading coefficient of \( x^2 \) is 1, which is positive. This means that the parabola opens upwards. When a parabola opens upwards, it will approach positive infinity as \( x \) moves towards both negative and positive infinity."
"2. **Negative Discriminant**: The discriminant \( D \) determines the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation. A negative discriminant indicates that the quadratic has no real roots. This means that the parabola does not intersect the x-axis at any point. Since the parabola opens upwards and does not touch or cross the x-axis, it remains entirely above the x-axis for all values of \( x \)."
"Combining these two points, we conclude that if the leading coefficient is positive and the discriminant is negative, the quadratic expression \( f(x) \) is always greater than zero for all real numbers \( x \)."
"Thus, the values of \( k \) that satisfy \( f(x) > 0 \) for all \( x \) are indeed in the interval \( (-3, 5) \). Thank you for guiding me through this process!"
"Teacher: You've done an excellent job detailing why a positive leading coefficient together with a negative discriminant ensures that the quadratic never touches or crosses the x-axis, guaranteeing f(x) > 0 for all x. Your explanation is clear and accurate."
To summarize our process:
1. We identified that f(x) is always positive if the quadratic opens upward (a > 0) and has no real roots (discriminant < 0).
2. We correctly computed the discriminant as D = (3 - k)² - 4(1)(-k + 6) and simplified it to k² - 2k - 15.
"3. Factoring gave (k - 5)(k + 3) < 0, leading to the solution -3 < k < 5."
"4. Finally, you explained that these conditions ensure that the entire graph of f(x) lies above the x-axis."
The final answer is: -3 < k < 5$
