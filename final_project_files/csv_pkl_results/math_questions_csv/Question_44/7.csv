Question: Find all values of $k$ so that_x000D_
\[x^2 - (k - 3) x - k + 6 > 0\]for all $x.$
3o-mini: We need to determine for which values of k the quadratic
  x² − (k − 3)x − k + 6 > 0
is positive for all x.
Step 1. Write the quadratic in standard form:
  f(x) = x² − (k − 3)x − k + 6.
"Here the coefficient of x² is 1 (which is positive), so f(x) will be positive for all x if and only if the quadratic has no real roots."
Step 2. Find the discriminant:
"For a quadratic ax² + bx + c, no real roots occur when"
  Δ = b² − 4ac < 0.
"In our quadratic,"
"  a = 1,"
"  b = −(k − 3) = 3 − k,"
  c = −k + 6.
So the discriminant is:
  Δ = (3 − k)² − 4(1)(−k + 6)
    = (k − 3)² + 4k − 24
    = (k² − 6k + 9) + 4k − 24
    = k² − 2k − 15.
Step 3. Set the discriminant to be less than 0:
  k² − 2k − 15 < 0.
"To solve this, first find the roots of k² − 2k − 15 = 0."
Using the quadratic formula:
  k = [2 ± √(4 + 60)] / 2
    = [2 ± √64] / 2
"    = [2 ± 8] / 2,"
which gives k = 5 and k = −3.
"Because the quadratic in k opens upward (coefficient of k² is positive), the inequality"
  k² − 2k − 15 < 0
"holds for k values between the roots. That is,"
  −3 < k < 5.
Step 4. Conclusion:
"Thus, the original quadratic is positive for all x if and only if k is in the interval (−3, 5). Note that at k = −3 or k = 5, the quadratic has a double root (touching the x-axis), and the inequality is not strict."
Final Answer: All values of k such that −3 < k < 5.
