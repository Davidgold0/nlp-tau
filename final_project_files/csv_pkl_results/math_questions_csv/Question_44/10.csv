Question: Find all values of $k$ so that_x000D_
\[x^2 - (k - 3) x - k + 6 > 0\]for all $x.$
3o-mini: We start with the quadratic
  f(x) = x² – (k – 3)x – k + 6.
"Since the coefficient of x² is 1 (which is positive), the quadratic opens upward. For f(x) to be positive for all real x, the quadratic must have no real roots—that is, its discriminant must be negative."
1. Write the quadratic in standard form:
  f(x) = x² – (k – 3)x – k + 6.
"2. Calculate the discriminant (D). For a quadratic ax² + bx + c, D = b² – 4ac."
"  Here, a = 1, b = –(k – 3), and c = –k + 6."
"  Thus, D = [–(k – 3)]² – 4(1)(–k + 6)."
3. Simplify the discriminant:
  [–(k – 3)]² = (k – 3)² = k² – 6k + 9.
  And –4(–k + 6) = 4k – 24.
"  So, D = (k² – 6k + 9) + (4k – 24) = k² – 2k – 15."
4. Factor the quadratic in k:
  k² – 2k – 15 factors as (k – 5)(k + 3).
5. Set the discriminant less than zero for f(x) to be always positive:
  (k – 5)(k + 3) < 0.
6. Solve the inequality:
  The expression (k – 5)(k + 3) is negative when k is between –3 and 5.
"  Thus, –3 < k < 5."
7. Check the endpoints:
"  If k = –3, then"
"   f(x) = x² – (–3 – 3)x – (–3) + 6 = x² + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)²,"
  which equals 0 when x = –3.
"  If k = 5, then"
"   f(x) = x² – (5 – 3)x – 5 + 6 = x² – 2x + 1 = (x – 1)²,"
  which equals 0 when x = 1.
"  Since we require f(x) > 0 for all x, these endpoint values are not allowed."
"Thus, the quadratic is positive for all x if and only if k is in the open interval (–3, 5)."
Final answer: all real k such that –3 < k < 5.
