Question: Find all values of $k$ so that_x000D_
\[x^2 - (k - 3) x - k + 6 > 0\]for all $x.$
Teacher: Let's start by understanding the overall plan for approaching this problem. We have a quadratic inequality:
  x² – (k – 3)x – k + 6 > 0  for all x.
"To ensure a quadratic is positive for every real x, we typically need to satisfy two things:"
1. The coefficient of x² (the “a” term) must be positive.
2. The discriminant of the quadratic must be negative (so that the quadratic has no real roots).
Here’s an outline of steps to solve the problem:
"Step 1: Rewrite the quadratic in the standard form ax² + bx + c. Identify a, b, and c."
Step 2: Check the condition for a to be positive.
Step 3: Write and simplify the discriminant (b² – 4ac) and set the inequality (discriminant < 0).
Step 4: Solve the inequality in k.
Step 5: Combine the conditions and conclude the set of k values.
"Let’s begin with Step 1. Could you please identify the values of a, b, and c in the quadratic expression? Also, mention briefly the relevant conditions for a quadratic to be positive for all x."
Student: Sure! Let's start with Step 1 and rewrite the quadratic in standard form:
The given quadratic inequality is:
\[ x^2 - (k - 3)x - k + 6 > 0. \]
"In standard form, this is:"
\[ ax^2 + bx + c \]
where:
"- \( a = 1 \) (the coefficient of \( x^2 \)),"
"- \( b = -(k - 3) = -k + 3 \),"
- \( c = -k + 6 \).
"For a quadratic to be positive for all \( x \), the following conditions must be met:"
"1. The coefficient \( a \) must be positive. In this case, since \( a = 1 \), it is already positive."
"2. The discriminant \( b^2 - 4ac \) must be negative, which ensures that the quadratic has no real roots."
"Now that we've identified \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we can move on to Step 2. Would you like me to proceed with checking the condition for \( a \) to be positive, or should we go directly to the discriminant?"
"Teacher: Great job on completing Step 1! You've correctly rewritten the quadratic in standard form and identified a = 1, b = –k + 3, and c = –k + 6, and you noted that a must be positive and the discriminant must be negative."
"Let's move on to Step 3. Please calculate the discriminant using the formula D = b² – 4ac. Substitute b = –k + 3 and c = –k + 6 (with a = 1) into the formula, simplify the expression in terms of k, and share your result."
Student: Sure! Let's calculate the discriminant \( D \) using the formula \( D = b^2 - 4ac \).
We have:
- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = -k + 3 \)
- \( c = -k + 6 \)
Substituting these values into the discriminant formula:
\[
D = (-k + 3)^2 - 4(1)(-k + 6)
\]
"Now, let's simplify this step by step:"
1. Calculate \( (-k + 3)^2 \):
   \[
   (-k + 3)^2 = k^2 - 6k + 9
   \]
2. Calculate \( -4(1)(-k + 6) \):
   \[
   -4(-k + 6) = 4k - 24
   \]
3. Combine these results:
   \[
   D = k^2 - 6k + 9 + 4k - 24
   \]
   \[
   D = k^2 - 2k - 15
   \]
"So, the discriminant in terms of \( k \) is:"
\[
D = k^2 - 2k - 15
\]
"Next, we need to ensure that this discriminant is negative, so we set up the inequality:"
\[
k^2 - 2k - 15 < 0
\]
Would you like me to proceed with solving this inequality for \( k \)?
"Teacher: Great job on finding the discriminant, and your work is spot on! You correctly computed that"
  D = k² – 2k – 15.
"Now, let’s move on to Step 4. In this step, we need to ensure that the quadratic is positive for all x by making certain that the discriminant is negative. That means we must solve the inequality:"
  k² – 2k – 15 < 0.
"Could you please start by finding the roots of the quadratic equation k² – 2k – 15 = 0? Once you have the roots, we can figure out on which interval the inequality holds. Please share your work for finding these roots."
"Student: Sure! To find the roots of the quadratic equation \( k^2 - 2k - 15 = 0 \), we can use the quadratic formula:"
\[
k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{D}}{2a}
\]
"where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( D \) is the discriminant of the quadratic, which in this case is \( D = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(-15) = 4 + 60 = 64 \)."
Now substituting into the quadratic formula:
\[
k = \frac{-(-2) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2(1)} = \frac{2 \pm 8}{2}
\]
This gives us two possible roots:
1. \( k = \frac{2 + 8}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \)
2. \( k = \frac{2 - 8}{2} = \frac{-6}{2} = -3 \)
So the roots of the equation \( k^2 - 2k - 15 = 0 \) are \( k = 5 \) and \( k = -3 \).
"Next, we can analyze the intervals determined by these roots to find where the inequality \( k^2 - 2k - 15 < 0 \) holds. The intervals to consider are:"
"- \( (-\infty, -3) \)"
"- \( (-3, 5) \)"
"- \( (5, \infty) \)"
"Now, we can test a point from each interval to see where the inequality is satisfied. Would you like me to proceed with this testing?"
"Teacher: Good work on finding the roots: k = 5 and k = –3. Now that you have the roots, we need to determine on which intervals the quadratic k² – 2k – 15 is negative. To do that, we consider the three intervals that these roots create:"
" • (–∞, –3)"
" • (–3, 5)"
" • (5, ∞)"
"Could you please choose one test point from one of these intervals—say, from the interval (–∞, –3)—and evaluate the expression k² – 2k – 15 at that point? This will help us figure out if the inequality k² – 2k –15 < 0 holds in that interval."
"Student: Sure! Let's choose a test point from the interval \((-∞, -3)\). A suitable test point could be \(k = -4\)."
"Now, let's evaluate the expression \(k^2 - 2k - 15\) at \(k = -4\):"
\[
k^2 - 2k - 15 = (-4)^2 - 2(-4) - 15
\]
Calculating this step by step:
1. \((-4)^2 = 16\)
2. \(-2(-4) = 8\)
3. Now combine these results: 
   \[
   16 + 8 - 15 = 9
   \]
"So, at \(k = -4\), we find:"
\[
k^2 - 2k - 15 = 9
\]
"Since \(9 > 0\), this means that the inequality \(k^2 - 2k - 15 < 0\) does not hold in the interval \((-∞, -3)\)."
"Next, we can test a point from the interval \((-3, 5)\). A good test point could be \(k = 0\). Should I go ahead and evaluate the expression at \(k = 0\)?"
"Teacher: Great choice! You've correctly demonstrated that in the interval (-∞, -3) the expression is positive at k = -4. Now, as you suggested, let's test the interval (-3, 5). Please choose a test point from (-3, 5), for example k = 0, and evaluate k² – 2k – 15 at that point. What result do you get, and what does it tell us about the inequality on this interval?"
Student: Sure! Let's evaluate the expression \(k^2 - 2k - 15\) at the test point \(k = 0\):
\[
k^2 - 2k - 15 = (0)^2 - 2(0) - 15
\]
Calculating this gives us:
\[
0 - 0 - 15 = -15
\]
"Since \(-15 < 0\), this means that the inequality \(k^2 - 2k - 15 < 0\) holds in the interval \((-3, 5)\)."
"Next, we should also test a point from the interval \((5, \infty)\) to see if the inequality holds there as well. A suitable test point could be \(k = 6\). Would you like me to evaluate the expression at \(k = 6\)?"
"Teacher: Great job evaluating at k = 0! Now, as the next step, let's test the interval (5, ∞). Please pick a test point from that interval—say, k = 6—and evaluate the expression k² – 2k – 15 at that point. What result do you get, and what does that tell you about whether the inequality holds in this interval?"
Student: Sure! Let's evaluate the expression \(k^2 - 2k - 15\) at the test point \(k = 6\):
\[
k^2 - 2k - 15 = (6)^2 - 2(6) - 15
\]
Calculating this step by step:
1. \( (6)^2 = 36 \)
2. \( -2(6) = -12 \)
3. Now combine these results:
   \[
   36 - 12 - 15 = 9
   \]
"So, at \(k = 6\), we find:"
\[
k^2 - 2k - 15 = 9
\]
"Since \(9 > 0\), this means that the inequality \(k^2 - 2k - 15 < 0\) does not hold in the interval \((5, \infty)\)."
To summarize our findings:
"- The inequality \(k^2 - 2k - 15 < 0\) holds in the interval \((-3, 5)\)."
"- It does not hold in the intervals \((-∞, -3)\) and \((5, \infty)\)."
"Thus, the solution set for \(k\) such that the quadratic inequality \(x^2 - (k - 3)x - k + 6 > 0\) holds for all \(x\) is:"
\[
"\boxed{(-3, 5)}"
\] 
Would you like to discuss anything further about this solution?
Teacher: Great work throughout this process! To summarize briefly:
"1. We rewrote the quadratic x² – (k – 3)x – k + 6 in standard form and identified a = 1, b = –k + 3, and c = –k + 6."
"2. Since a = 1 is positive, we focused on the discriminant."
3. You computed the discriminant as D = k² – 2k – 15.
"4. Setting D < 0, we solved the inequality k² – 2k – 15 < 0 by first finding the roots k = –3 and k = 5 and then testing intervals."
5. Testing confirmed that the inequality holds only when k is between –3 and 5.
"Thus, the quadratic is positive for all x when k lies in the interval (–3, 5)."
"(-3, 5)$"
