Question: Find all values of $k$ so that_x000D_
\[x^2 - (k - 3) x - k + 6 > 0\]for all $x.$
3o-mini: We are given the inequality
  x² – (k – 3)x – k + 6 > 0  for all real numbers x.
Step 1. Write the quadratic in standard form.
"Rewriting the expression, we have:"
  x² – (k – 3)x – k + 6 = x² + (3 – k)x + (6 – k).
Step 2. Determine the conditions for the quadratic to be positive for all x.
"A quadratic ax² + bx + c (with a > 0) is positive for all x if and only if its discriminant is negative. Here, a = 1, which is positive, so we need:"
  Discriminant < 0.
Step 3. Compute the discriminant.
"The discriminant, Δ, of our quadratic is:"
"  Δ = b² – 4ac,"
where b = 3 – k and c = 6 – k. Plugging these in:
  Δ = (3 – k)² – 4(1)(6 – k)
    = 9 – 6k + k² – 24 + 4k
    = k² – 2k – 15.
Step 4. Solve the inequality Δ < 0.
We need:
  k² – 2k – 15 < 0.
"To solve this, first factor the quadratic. Find the roots by setting k² – 2k – 15 = 0:"
  k = [2 ± √(4 + 60)] / 2 = [2 ± √64] / 2 = [2 ± 8] / 2.
"Thus, the roots are:"
  k = (2 + 8)/2 = 5  and  k = (2 – 8)/2 = –3.
"Since the quadratic opens upwards, the inequality k² – 2k – 15 < 0 holds for k between the roots:"
  –3 < k < 5.
Step 5. Conclusion.
"For the given quadratic to be positive for all real x, we must have:"
  –3 < k < 5.
"Thus, the solution is all values of k in the interval (–3, 5)."
