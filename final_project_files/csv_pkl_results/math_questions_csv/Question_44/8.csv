Question: Find all values of $k$ so that_x000D_
\[x^2 - (k - 3) x - k + 6 > 0\]for all $x.$
3o-mini: We want the quadratic
  f(x) = x² – (k – 3)x – k + 6
to be greater than 0 for all values of x.
Step 1. Write f(x) in standard form:
"  f(x) = x² + bx + c,"
where
  b = –(k – 3) = 3 – k  and  c = –k + 6.
"Step 2. Since the coefficient of x² is 1 (which is positive), the quadratic will be positive for all x if it has no real roots. This is true when its discriminant is negative."
"Step 3. Compute the discriminant, D:"
  D = b² – 4ac = (3 – k)² – 4(1)(–k + 6)
    = (3 – k)² + 4k – 24.
Expand (3 – k)²:
  (3 – k)² = k² – 6k + 9.
"Thus,"
  D = k² – 6k + 9 + 4k – 24
    = k² – 2k – 15.
This factors as:
  k² – 2k – 15 = (k – 5)(k + 3).
"Step 4. For f(x) > 0 for all x, the discriminant must be strictly negative:"
  (k – 5)(k + 3) < 0.
This inequality holds when k is between –3 and 5:
  –3 < k < 5.
"Step 5. Finally, check the endpoints. When k = –3 or k = 5 the discriminant is zero, which would cause the quadratic to be a perfect square and take the value 0 for one x. Since we require f(x) > 0 for all x, these endpoint values must be excluded."
"Therefore, the quadratic is positive for all x if and only if:"
  –3 < k < 5.
