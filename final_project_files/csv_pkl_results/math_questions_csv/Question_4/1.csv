Question: Three tiles are marked X and two other tiles are marked O. The five tiles are randomly arranged in a row. What is the probability that the arrangement reads XOXOX?
Teacher: Let's work through the problem step by step. 
"First, let's rephrase the problem in our own words: We have 5 positions in a row. Three of these positions will be filled with an X, and the other two positions will be filled with an O. We need to find the probability that the specific arrangement is X, then O, then X, then O, then X (i.e., XOXOX)."
Step 1: Determine the total number of ways to arrange the three X's and two O's among the five positions. Think about how you can count these arrangements. What number do you get?
Please share your calculation for the total number of arrangements.
"Student: To find the total number of ways to arrange three X's and two O's among the five positions, we can use the formula for combinations. The total arrangements can be calculated using the formula for permutations of a multiset:"
\[
\text{Total arrangements} = \frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2!}
\]
"where \( n \) is the total number of items to arrange, \( n_1 \) is the number of X's, and \( n_2 \) is the number of O's."
In our case:
- \( n = 5 \) (total tiles)
- \( n_1 = 3 \) (X's)
- \( n_2 = 2 \) (O's)
Now we can calculate:
\[
\text{Total arrangements} = \frac{5!}{3! \cdot 2!}
\]
Calculating the factorials:
- \( 5! = 120 \)
- \( 3! = 6 \)
- \( 2! = 2 \)
Putting these values into the formula gives us:
\[
\text{Total arrangements} = \frac{120}{6 \cdot 2} = \frac{120}{12} = 10
\]
"So, the total number of arrangements of the tiles is 10."
Teacher: Great job! You've correctly calculated that there are 10 total arrangements.
"Now, let's move to the next step:"
Step 2: Determine the number of favorable outcomes. This means figuring out how many arrangements match the specific pattern XOXOX. Can you explain how many arrangements yield exactly this pattern and why?
Please share your reasoning for this part.
"Student: Student: Thank you! For the second step, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes that match the specific arrangement XOXOX."
"Since XOXOX is a very specific sequence, there is only one arrangement that matches this pattern. The tiles must be in the exact order of X, O, X, O, X, which means there are no alternative arrangements that would still read as XOXOX."
"Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 1."
To summarize:
- There is only **1 arrangement** that matches the pattern XOXOX.
"Now, we can move on to the final step of calculating the probability. Would you like me to proceed with that?"
Teacher: You've done a great job outlining the problem so far. To summarize:
1. We determined the total number of arrangements is 10.
2. We found that there is exactly 1 arrangement that matches the pattern XOXOX.
"Now, letâ€™s move to the final step:"
"Step 3: Calculate the probability. To do this, you need to divide the number of favorable outcomes (which is 1) by the total number of outcomes (which is 10)."
Please perform this calculation and share your final probability. What do you get for the probability that the arrangement reads XOXOX?
"Student: To calculate the probability that the arrangement reads XOXOX, we use the formula for probability:"
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}
\]
"From our previous steps, we have:"
- Number of favorable outcomes = 1 (the arrangement XOXOX)
- Total number of outcomes = 10 (the total arrangements of the tiles)
"Now, substituting these values into the formula gives us:"
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{1}{10}
\]
"Therefore, the probability that the arrangement reads XOXOX is \(\frac{1}{10}\)."
Teacher: Excellent work! You've correctly reached the final step. 
"Now, please state your final probability calculation as a single fraction followed immediately by a $, with nothing after the $."
What is your final answer?
Student: \(\frac{1}{10}\$
Teacher: 1/10$
