Question: Three tiles are marked X and two other tiles are marked O. The five tiles are randomly arranged in a row. What is the probability that the arrangement reads XOXOX?
"3o-mini: There are a total of 5 tiles—three X’s and two O’s. When arranging these indistinguishable tiles, the total number of distinct arrangements is given by"
  Total arrangements = 5! / (3! × 2!) = 10.
Only one of these 10 possible arrangements is exactly XOXOX.
"Thus, the probability is 1/10."
