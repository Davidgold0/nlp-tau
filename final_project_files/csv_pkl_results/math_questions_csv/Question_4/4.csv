Question: Three tiles are marked X and two other tiles are marked O. The five tiles are randomly arranged in a row. What is the probability that the arrangement reads XOXOX?
Teacher: Let's begin by restating the problem in our own words:
We have 5 tiles in total. Three of them are marked X and two are marked O. They are randomly arranged in a row. We need to find the probability that the final arrangement reads XOXOX.
"To find the probability, we need to follow these steps:"
1. Determine the total number of different arrangements possible given that some tiles are identical.
2. Determine how many of those arrangements exactly match the pattern XOXOX.
3. Calculate the probability as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.
Let's start with Step 1: Compute the total number of arrangements for 3 X's and 2 O's. Can you work out how many unique arrangements there are using the idea of permutations with identical items? Please share your work for this step.
"Student: To find the total number of arrangements of the tiles, we can use the formula for permutations of a multiset. The formula is:"
\[
\text{Total arrangements} = \frac{n!}{n_1! \times n_2!}
\]
where:
"- \( n \) is the total number of items,"
"- \( n_1 \) is the number of identical items of one type (in this case, X's),"
"- \( n_2 \) is the number of identical items of another type (in this case, O's)."
In our problem:
- We have a total of \( n = 5 \) tiles (3 X's and 2 O's).
"- So, \( n_1 = 3 \) (for X's) and \( n_2 = 2 \) (for O's)."
"Now, we can plug in the values into the formula:"
\[
\text{Total arrangements} = \frac{5!}{3! \times 2!}
\]
Calculating the factorials:
- \( 5! = 120 \)
- \( 3! = 6 \)
- \( 2! = 2 \)
Now substituting these values into the formula:
\[
\text{Total arrangements} = \frac{120}{6 \times 2} = \frac{120}{12} = 10
\]
"So, the total number of unique arrangements of the tiles is 10. "
"Does this calculation make sense, and should we move on to Step 2 to find how many arrangements match the pattern XOXOX?"
Teacher: Great job! Your calculation of the total number of unique arrangements is correct â€“ there are 10 different ways to arrange 3 X's and 2 O's.
"Now, let's move to Step 2: Determining the number of arrangements that match the pattern XOXOX."
"Remember, our pattern is fixed as X in the 1st position, O in the 2nd, X in the 3rd, O in the 4th, and X in the 5th position."
Could you work out how many of these arrangements exactly match this pattern? Please share your reasoning and calculations for just this step.
"Student: To determine how many arrangements match the specific pattern XOXOX, we need to observe that the pattern is fixed:"
1. The first tile is X.
2. The second tile is O.
3. The third tile is X.
4. The fourth tile is O.
5. The fifth tile is X.
"Since the pattern is completely defined and there are no variations allowed (we cannot change the positions of X's and O's), there is only **one** arrangement that matches the pattern XOXOX."
"Thus, the number of arrangements that exactly match the pattern XOXOX is **1**."
Shall we proceed to Step 3 to calculate the probability using this information?
Teacher: Excellent work so far! Now let's move to Step 3: We need to calculate the probability given the number of favorable outcomes (which is 1) and the total number of arrangements (which is 10). Can you show how to set up this probability fraction and simplify it if needed? Please work through this next step on your own.
"Student: To calculate the probability of the arrangement reading XOXOX, we will use the formula for probability:"
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}
\]
"From our previous steps, we found:"
- The number of favorable outcomes (arrangements that match XOXOX) is **1**.
- The total number of unique arrangements is **10**.
Now we can set up the probability fraction:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{1}{10}
\]
This fraction is already in its simplest form. 
"Therefore, the probability that the arrangement of the tiles reads XOXOX is **\(\frac{1}{10}\)**. "
"Does this make sense, and is there anything else you would like to discuss about this problem?"
"Teacher: Excellent work throughout our discussion! To summarize, we first computed the total number of unique arrangements of 3 X's and 2 O's as 10. Then, we noted that only one arrangement exactly matches the given pattern XOXOX. Finally, we calculated the probability by dividing the one favorable outcome by the total number of outcomes, giving us 1/10. "
Your final answer is: 1/10$
