Question: Three tiles are marked X and two other tiles are marked O. The five tiles are randomly arranged in a row. What is the probability that the arrangement reads XOXOX?
"3o-mini: There are 5 positions in a row and we need to choose 3 of those for the X tiles. The total number of distinct arrangements is given by ""5 choose 3,"" which is"
  5C3 = 10.
"Only one of these arrangements is X in positions 1, 3, and 5 (and O in positions 2 and 4), which corresponds to reading XOXOX. Thus, the probability is"
  1/10.
