Question: Three tiles are marked X and two other tiles are marked O. The five tiles are randomly arranged in a row. What is the probability that the arrangement reads XOXOX?
"Teacher: Let's start by understanding the problem in our own words: We have five tiles, with three tiles marked X and two tiles marked O. They are arranged randomly in a row. We want to find the probability that the arrangement reads exactly “XOXOX.”"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into the following steps:"
1. Calculate the total number of distinct arrangements of the five tiles.
2. Identify the number of favorable arrangements where the sequence is exactly “XOXOX.”
3. Compute the probability as (number of favorable outcomes) / (total number of outcomes).
"Now, let’s start with the first step. "
Step 1: Determine the total number of distinct arrangements using three X’s and two O’s. 
Please provide your reasoning and calculation for this step.
"Student: To determine the total number of distinct arrangements of the five tiles (three X's and two O's), we can use the formula for permutations of a multiset. The formula is:"
\[
\text{Total arrangements} = \frac{n!}{n_1! \times n_2!}
\]
where:
"- \( n \) is the total number of items,"
"- \( n_1 \) is the number of identical items of one type (X's),"
- \( n_2 \) is the number of identical items of another type (O's).
In our case:
"- \( n = 5 \) (the total number of tiles),"
"- \( n_1 = 3 \) (the number of X's),"
- \( n_2 = 2 \) (the number of O's).
"Now, we can plug the values into the formula:"
\[
\text{Total arrangements} = \frac{5!}{3! \times 2!}
\]
Calculating the factorials:
- \( 5! = 120 \)
- \( 3! = 6 \)
- \( 2! = 2 \)
Now substituting these values into the formula:
\[
\text{Total arrangements} = \frac{120}{6 \times 2} = \frac{120}{12} = 10
\]
"So, the total number of distinct arrangements of the five tiles is 10. "
Would you like me to proceed to the next step?
Teacher: Great job on computing the total number of distinct arrangements as 10!
"Now, let's move on to step 2: identifying the number of favorable outcomes where the arrangement reads exactly ""XOXOX."""
"Remember, the favorable outcome is just the one specific sequence ""XOXOX"" among all the possible arrangements. "
"Could you please explain your reasoning on how many arrangements exactly match ""XOXOX"" and share your answer for this step?"
"Student: Student: For step 2, we need to identify the number of favorable outcomes where the arrangement reads exactly ""XOXOX."" "
"In this case, there is only one specific arrangement that matches ""XOXOX,"" and that is the arrangement itself. Since we are looking for the exact sequence, there are no other arrangements that would fit this requirement. "
"Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is:"
\[
\text{Favorable outcomes} = 1
\]
"So, we have one favorable arrangement that matches ""XOXOX."" "
Shall I proceed to step 3 to compute the probability?
"Teacher: Great job so far! You've correctly identified that there is only 1 favorable outcome. Now, let's move on to step 3."
Step 3: Compute the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes. Please set up and simplify that ratio. What do you get?
"Student: Student: To compute the probability, we will use the formula:"
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}
\]
"From our previous steps, we have:"
"- Number of favorable outcomes = 1 (the arrangement ""XOXOX"")"
- Total number of outcomes = 10 (the distinct arrangements of the tiles)
"Now, substituting these values into the formula gives us:"
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{1}{10}
\]
"Thus, the probability that the arrangement reads ""XOXOX"" is:"
\[
\text{Probability} = 0.1
\]
Would you like me to summarize the entire solution?
Teacher: Great work! To summarize our discussion:
1. We first determined the total number of distinct arrangements of three X's and two O's using the formula for permutations of a multiset: 5!/(3!×2!) = 10.
"2. Then, we identified that exactly one arrangement meets the requirement ""XOXOX."""
"3. Finally, we computed the probability as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes, which is 1/10."
