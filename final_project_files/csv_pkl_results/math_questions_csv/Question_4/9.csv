Question: Three tiles are marked X and two other tiles are marked O. The five tiles are randomly arranged in a row. What is the probability that the arrangement reads XOXOX?
"3o-mini: There are 5 tiles in total, with 3 marked X and 2 marked O. Since the tiles marked X are identical, and the tiles marked O are identical, the number of distinct arrangements is given by the combination C(5, 3) (or equivalently C(5, 2)). This evaluates to:"
"C(5, 3) = 5! / (3! Ã— 2!) = 10"
"Only one of these arrangements is X, O, X, O, X (with X in positions 1, 3, 5 and O in positions 2, 4). Therefore, the probability of obtaining the arrangement XOXOX is:"
Probability = 1/10
