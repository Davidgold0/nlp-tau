Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '6r1/1P5p/3bp3/8/3k4/2R2K2/7P/3N4 w - - 1 45'. 
"What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
"3o-mini: The winning idea is to “prepare” the b‐pawn’s promotion so that its resulting queen won’t be immediately lost to the bishop from d6. In the given position a quick pawn–promotion (b7‐b8=Q) would fall prey to  …Bxb8, and after 46.Rxb8 the exchange would leave little extra. Instead White can improve the protection of the new queen’s square. For example, by playing"
 c3b3
White places the rook on the b–file so that once b7–b8=Q is played the newly‑promoted queen is defended. Any capture on b8 (by …Bxb8) is met by Rxb8 and leaves White with a decisive material advantage. 
"Thus, the best move is: c3b3"
