Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'r2Q1k1r/1b2ppbp/pp4pq/8/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2R2K1 b - - 5 18'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
"3o-mini: The winning move is to capture the offending queen. Black can simply play a8d8. This move uses the a8‐rook along the eighth rank (since b8 and c8 are empty) to take the white queen sitting on d8. After 18…a8d8, white’s best recapture is 19.Rxd8, and Black emerges a clear winner by trading a rook (≈5 points) for a queen (≈9 points)."
"Thus, the single best move for Black is: a8d8."
