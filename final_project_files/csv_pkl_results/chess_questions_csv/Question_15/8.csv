Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '8/pp2Qpk1/6p1/3PN2r/7q/3B2K1/PP6/8 w - - 1 36'. 
"What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
"3o-mini: The winning move is to capture on f7 with the queen. In other words, 1. Qxf7+ is best (in coordinate‐notation, “e7f7”). "
"Let me briefly explain: In the initial position the white queen stands on e7 and the black pawn on f7 is the only piece lying between your queen and the enemy king on g7. By playing Qxf7+ you not only win material but also force the black king into a terrible situation. (In one line after 1. Qxf7+, if Black goes Kh8 then 2. Qh7# delivers mate; if Black chooses 1…Kh6, White is ready to follow up with decisive threats.) "
Thus the best move for White is:
e7f7
