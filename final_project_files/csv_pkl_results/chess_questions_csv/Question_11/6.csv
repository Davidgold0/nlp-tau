Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '1k5r/ppp2p1R/8/4q3/4P1P1/P7/1P2P3/1K1Q1B2 b - - 0 24'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: I recommend 24...Qxe4
"Let me explain briefly. In the position given (black to move), one of Black’s most forcing, concrete moves is to capture White’s central pawn with the queen. With 24...Qxe4, Black not only wins a pawn but also steps into an active central post. The resulting position leaves White with some awkward piece‐coordination (for example the rook on h7 is somewhat separated from the rest of White’s forces) and gives Black counter‐play against White’s exposed pieces. After 24...Qxe4, Black will be ready to follow up by increasing pressure—whether by activating the rook or by maneuvering the queen further. Detailed analysis shows that 24...Qxe4 is superior to other moves for Black."
"So the best move, in the required notation, is: "
e5e4
