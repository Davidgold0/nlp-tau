Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'R4bk1/3prp1p/1Q6/1pP2ppN/1q1P4/4P1P1/5P1P/6K1 b - - 1 29'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The move is b4d4.
"To explain briefly without revealing all inner calculations: Black’s best tactical resource is to counterattack in the center. By playing Qd4 (moving the queen from b4 to d4), Black immediately captures a pawn and puts pressure on key central and kingside squares. In many concrete variations this move not only wins material but also interferes with White’s defensive setup (for example by eyeing the critical diagonal that runs through e3–f2–g1). Analysis shows that none of White’s replies can adequately deal with the dual problems that Qd4 creates. "
"Thus, the best move for Black is: b4d4."
