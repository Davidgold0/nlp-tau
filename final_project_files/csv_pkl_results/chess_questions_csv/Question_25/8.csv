Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '6r1/1P5p/3bp3/8/8/2Rk1K2/7P/3N4 b - - 0 44'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
"3o-mini: The move that most effectively stops White’s dangerous b‐pawn while preserving Black’s advantage is to play the bishop to b8. In the position (FEN ""6r1/1P5p/3bp3/8/8/2Rk1K2/7P/3N4 b - - 0 44""), Black’s bishop currently sits on d6 and has a diagonally direct path to b8. By playing"
  d6b8
"Black covers the promotion square b8. This prevents White’s pawn on b7 from advancing to b8 for promotion. Moreover, the bishop on b8 is well placed—without compromising Black’s other pieces—and leaves Black in a better position going forward."
"Thus, the best move for Black is: d6b8."
