Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '6r1/1P5p/3bp3/8/8/2pk1K2/2R4P/3N4 w - - 4 44'. 
"What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
"3o-mini: The winning idea is to first sacrifice the rook on c2 by capturing Black’s pawn on c3, and then use the resulting discovered attack to force promotion of the b‐pawn on the next move. In concrete terms, the best move is"
  c2c3
"Let me explain briefly. White’s b‐pawn is one step from queening but if promoted immediately the new queen on b8 falls on the long, open 8th–rank (where Black’s rook on g8 is firing). Instead, with 1.Rxc3+ (that is, c2 to c3, capturing the pawn on c3 with check) Black must react to the check. In the resulting variations White will be able to safely promote the pawn (after, for example, moving the knight to interpose a discovered check) and gain a decisive advantage."
"So the correct move, in the required notation, is:"
c2c3
