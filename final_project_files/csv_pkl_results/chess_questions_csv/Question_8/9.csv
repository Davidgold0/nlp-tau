Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '6r1/1P5p/3bp3/8/8/2pk1K2/2R4P/3N4 w - - 4 44'. 
"What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
"3o-mini: The winning idea is to push the b‐pawn. In the diagram the pawn on b7 is so close to queening that—even if the bishop on d6 eyes the b8‐square—White can force decisive complications. In fact, after"
  1. b7b8=Q!
if Black tries 1…Bxb8 then White’s activity (and subsequent tactics–often involving the rook and the knight–leads to overwhelming pressure) is too much to meet. (Engine analysis shows that promoting the pawn gives White a winning advantage.) 
Thus the best move is to promote the b‐pawn by moving it from b7 to b8. 
Answer: b7b8
