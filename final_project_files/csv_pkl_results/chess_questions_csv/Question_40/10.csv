Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'rn1q1bnr/1pp1kBpp/3p4/p3N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BbK2R w KQ - 1 7'. 
"What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
"3o-mini: The move that wins material immediately is to jump the knight from e5 to c6. This move is a fork: after 1. Ne5â€“c6, the knight simultaneously checks the black king on e7 and attacks the queen on d8 (as well as other pieces). This forces black to respond to the check, allowing White to capture the queen on the following move. "
"Thus, the best move for White is: e5c6."
