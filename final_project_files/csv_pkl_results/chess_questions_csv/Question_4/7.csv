Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'r4k1r/1b1Qppbp/pp4pq/8/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2R2K1 w - - 4 18'. 
"What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
"3o-mini: The winning continuation is to play the rook to d8. In other words, the best move is:"
d1d8
"To explain briefly: by playing Rd8 you cut off the Black king’s escape on the 8th‐rank. Black’s only way to interpose is with the rook on a8 (since any king move is immediately ruled out by the coordinated control of key escape squares by the queen on d7 and the new rook on d8). After 18.Rd8, Black is forced to answer 18...Rxa8xd8, and then White has the crushing 19.Qxf7#, which is checkmate."
"So the engine’s verdict is 18.Rd8, i.e. “d1d8”."
