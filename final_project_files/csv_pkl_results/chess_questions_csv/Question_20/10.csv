Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '8/5p2/P4p1p/1p6/4k3/7P/6PK/8 b - - 0 44'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The best move is e4f4. 
"To explain briefly without full engine details: Black’s king on e4 is in an ideal position to start mobilizing against White’s dispersed pawns. By playing 44...Kf4, Black moves the king further into enemy territory, setting up to attack White’s advancing kingside pawns while also keeping an eye on the queenside. Engine‐and‐tablebase work confirms that this king move—not a pawn push—initiates the decisive plan, making e4f4 the strongest choice."
"So, the answer is: e4f4."
