Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'rn1qr1k1/pp4p1/2p2npp/2b5/2Q1p3/2N3P1/PPP3BP/R1B2R1K b - - 3 15'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: I recommend 15...f6d5. 
"This move sends Black’s knight from f6 to d5. In that position the knight eyes the c3‐square and challenges White’s coordination – in some lines, if White is not precise (for example by recapturing with the queen rather than the knight), the vulnerable c3–knight (which is defended only by a pawn) may fall. In many concrete variations Black obtains sufficient counterplay and a very active position. "
"Thus, the best move for Black is: f6d5."
