Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'rn1qr1k1/pp4p1/2p2npp/2b5/2Q1p3/2N3P1/PPP3BP/R1B2R1K b - - 3 15'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: I recommend the move f6h5. 
"A key idea behind this move is that it re‐routes the f6–knight toward h5 (and later possibly to f4), helping to orchestrate a kingside pressure. In many similar tactical positions Black uses the knight maneuver in tandem with the queen (often heading to h4) to generate serious threats against White’s weakened kingside. In the present position f6h5 develops Black’s plan rapidly while keeping the initiative."
"Thus, the best move is: f6h5."
