Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'rn1qr1k1/pp4p1/2p2npp/2b5/2Q1p3/2N3P1/PPP3BP/R1B2R1K b - - 3 15'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
"3o-mini: After careful analysis the move that best meets Black’s defensive and counter‐attacking needs is to interpose the queen along the f7–g8 diagonal. In the position with White’s queen on c4 eyeing f7, Black can blunt that threat by playing"
  d8e7
This move not only covers the critical f7–square but also prepares to connect the rooks and mobilize the other pieces.
