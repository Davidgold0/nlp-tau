Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'rn1qr1k1/pp4p1/2p2npp/2b5/4p3/2N3P1/PPP1Q1BP/R1B2R1K w - - 2 15'. 
"What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The best move is c3e4. 
"A brief explanation: By playing 15.Nxe4, White captures Black’s central pawn without risking a tactical blow. If Black tries to recapture the knight (for example, with …Nxe4), White has the resource 16.Bxe4—the bishop on g2 helps recapture on e4, so Black cannot exploit the loose positioning that would arise if White’s queen moved to e4. In contrast, a direct move like Qxe4 would simply lose the queen to …Nxe4. Thus, 15.Nxe4 (moving the knight from c3 to e4) wins material safely."
