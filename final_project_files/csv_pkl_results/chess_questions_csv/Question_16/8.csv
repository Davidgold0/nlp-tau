Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'rn1qr1k1/pp4p1/2p2npp/2b5/4p3/2N3P1/PPP1Q1BP/R1B2R1K w - - 2 15'. 
"What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
"3o-mini: The move that appears strongest is 15. Nxe4, so the answer is: c3e4. "
"Let me explain briefly without going into excessive detail: By moving the knight from c3 to e4, White immediately challenges Black’s central pawn structure. Though Black can recapture (likely with the f6–knight), the resulting exchanges give White a more active and central position. The knight on e4 (and the exchanges that follow) open lines for White’s pieces, and improves coordination and control of key central squares. This is why 15. Nxe4 is the strongest candidate move in the position. "
The answer in the required format is: c3e4.
