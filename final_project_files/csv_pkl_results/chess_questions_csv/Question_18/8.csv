Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'R4bk1/3prp1p/1Q6/1pP2ppN/3P4/4P1P1/5P1P/1q4K1 w - - 2 30'. 
"What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The best move is a8f8. 
"After 30. Rxf8+ white immediately removes Black’s key defender (the bishop on f8) with a forcing capture. Black’s only response is 30…Kxf8, and after that white’s follow‐up (using the active queen and knight) will win decisive material or lead to a mating net. "
"Thus, the recommended move is: a8f8."
