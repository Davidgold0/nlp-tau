Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '1r2r1k1/5pp1/p6Q/2p5/4p3/1P4q1/P1P2PPP/4R1K1 w - - 0 31'. 
"What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The winning idea is to deflect the defender on the back‐rank. White should play:
e1e8
"Explanation (briefly): By capturing on e8 with the rook, White gives check. Black cannot block or move his king away safely – the only recapture is with Black’s b8–rook. Then White mates immediately with Qh8#. Thus, 31.Rxe8+ is the best move."
