Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '2r2r1k/p5p1/2R1Q2p/3pBn2/3P4/4q3/P5PP/2R4K b - - 2 28'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
"3o-mini: The move that wins material for Black is 28...Qh3, i.e. moving the queen from e3 to h3."
Let me briefly explain the idea:
"• Black’s queen “jumps” from e3 to h3, creating two immediate threats. First, Qxh1 would mate White’s king on h1. Second, if White must guard against mate (or try to “step aside”), Black will soon have time to use the knight on f5. For example, after any passive defense from White, Black can play ...Nxd4 (capturing White’s pawn on d4) and, from its new post on d4, the knight forks White’s queen (on e6) and the rook on c6. (Were White to recapture on d4, the fork would be neutralized – but that move concedes that if White doesn’t capture immediately then Black wins the rook. And if White recaptures, Black has at least won a pawn for the cost of a knight – much less than the value of the rook that will eventually fall.)"
"Thus, by 28...Qh3 Black mixes a mate‐threat on h1 with tactical ideas (specifically, the idea of ...Nxd4 forking queen and rook), and this combination turns out to be the best move."
In the required notation the answer is: 
e3h3
