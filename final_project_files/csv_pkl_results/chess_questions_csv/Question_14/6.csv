Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '2r2r1k/p5p1/2R1Q2p/3pBn2/3P4/4q3/P5PP/2R4K b - - 2 28'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The best move is e3g3. 
"To explain briefly without all the internal details: by playing Qg3 the black queen moves to a square defended by the f5–knight, and it immediately creates a deadly mate‐threat (for example, threatening Qxh2#). None of white’s resources can safely capture or block this queen because any attempt (such as having the pawn on h2 capture on g3) loses to the knight’s recapture. This forcing threat wins material (or mate) for Black, and our engine analysis shows that no other move gives Black as much of an advantage."
"Thus, the answer is: e3g3."
