Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '2r2r1k/p5p1/2R1Q2p/3pBn2/3P4/4q3/P5PP/2R4K b - - 2 28'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
"3o-mini: The key tactical idea is to remove White’s active rook and then make use of the knight’s potential fork. In the given position, Black’s best move is to capture on c6 with the c8‐rook. After"
  28…Rxc6
"if White recaptures with 29.Qxc6 (if 29.Rxc6 then 29…Nxd4 forks queen and rook), Black can play 29…Nxd4; from d4 the knight attacks the queen on c6 (via the 2‑up/1‑left move) so that White must lose material. In this way Black wins at least a pawn and obtains good compensation."
So the move is: c8c6
