Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '1r3rk1/6p1/3p3p/3P4/3Q1p2/2n4P/5PP1/R4RK1 b - - 0 28'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: After careful calculation I found that the decisive tactical resource is to jump the knight to e2. In the given position Black’s best move is:
c3e2
This move attacks White’s queen on d4. In most lines the forced retreat of the queen (or its interposition) permits Black to generate serious counter‐play.
