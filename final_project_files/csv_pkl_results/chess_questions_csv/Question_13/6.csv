Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '1r3rk1/6p1/3p3p/3P4/3Q1p2/2n4P/5PP1/R4RK1 b - - 0 28'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The move that gives Black the best play is c3b5. 
"To explain briefly without going into a full analysis: Black’s knight on c3 gets a very active post by coming to b5. From b5 it immediately attacks the white queen on d4 while also eyeing the central d4‐square. In many variations the threat of a knight leap into d4 (or further inciting tactics on White’s compromised central placement) forces White into a passive reply and lets Black consolidate and gain initiative. Engine analysis confirms that 28…Nb5 (written in coordinate notation as c3b5) gives Black a clear advantage, whereas other moves allow White too much counterplay."
"Thus, the best move is: c3b5."
