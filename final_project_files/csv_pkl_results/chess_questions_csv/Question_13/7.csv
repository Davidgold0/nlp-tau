Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '1r3rk1/6p1/3p3p/3P4/3Q1p2/2n4P/5PP1/R4RK1 b - - 0 28'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: c3e2
"After careful analysis, Blackâ€™s most forcing move is to jump the knight from c3 to e2. This move is a tactical fork: from e2 the knight attacks both the White queen on d4 and gives check to the White king on g1. White has no satisfactory way to parry the check while also saving the queen, making c3e2 the best move for Black."
