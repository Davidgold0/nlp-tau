Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'b1r5/5p1k/4p1p1/4P2p/R2PP3/R1P1b1QP/5NPK/N3q3 b - - 8 41'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The winning move is e1h4. 
"To explain briefly without giving away all engine details: Black’s queen‑move to h4 creates an immediate, decisive mating threat (with Qxh2# looming) that White cannot parry without material loss or immediate mate. This tactical resource makes 41…Qh4 clearly the best move for Black. "
So the answer is: e1h4.
