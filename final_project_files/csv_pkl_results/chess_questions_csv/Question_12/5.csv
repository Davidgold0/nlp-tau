Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '8/5k2/p2pNqpr/2pPp3/2P1B3/4P3/PP2K1R1/8 w - - 4 46'. 
"What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
Teacher: Let's begin by breaking down exactly what we need to do. The problem gives us a chess position in FEN format:  
'8/5k2/p2pNqpr/2pPp3/2P1B3/4P3/PP2K1R1/8 w - - 4 46'  
"Our task is to find the best move for White, in the notation [source square][destination square] (like “f8f4”). We need to work step by step without jumping to the final answer."
Step 1: Understand and analyze the board from the FEN.  
This involves:
• Reconstructing the board to see where every piece is placed.
• Noting whose move it is (White’s turn) and any important factors like the position and activity of the pieces.
"• Identifying potential threats, tactical motifs, and candidate moves that make sense in the position."
"Could you start by describing what you see on the board from that FEN? For example, try to identify key areas where White has an advantage or where Black's pieces might be vulnerable. Let’s focus just on this step. What key observations can you share about the position?"
"Student: Sure! Analyzing the board from the FEN '8/5k2/p2pNqpr/2pPp3/2P1B3/4P3/PP2K1R1/8', here’s what I see:"
1. **Board Layout**: 
   - The 8th rank has a Black king on f7.
   - The 7th rank has a Black pawn on a6 and two Black pawns on c6 and d6.
"   - The 6th rank has a White knight on e6 and a Black queen on f6, along with a Black rook on g7."
   - The 5th rank has a White pawn on d5 and a White bishop on e5.
   - The 4th rank has a White pawn on c4 and a Black pawn on d5.
   - The 3rd rank has a White pawn on e3.
"   - The 2nd rank has White pawns on a2 and b2, and a White rook on f2."
   - The 1st rank has a White king on f2.
2. **Key Observations**:
   - It’s White’s turn to move.
"   - White has a knight on e6, which is well-placed and can create tactical threats."
"   - The Black king on f7 is somewhat exposed, and the Black queen on f6 might be vulnerable to attacks."
   - The White bishop on e5 controls important squares and can put pressure on Black's position.
"   - There are several pawns on the board, and White has more advanced pawns compared to Black."
3. **Potential Threats**:
   - The knight on e6 can threaten the Black queen on f6.
   - The White bishop on e5 can work in coordination with the knight to create threats against the Black pieces.
"Overall, White seems to have a strong position with active pieces and potential tactical opportunities against the Black king and queen. "
What would you like me to focus on next?
"Teacher: Great observations! Before we move on, let’s double-check the reconstruction of the board to ensure our understanding is accurate. Here’s a quick review of the FEN ""8/5k2/p2pNqpr/2pPp3/2P1B3/4P3/PP2K1R1/8 w - - 4 46"": "
• Rank 8: 8 empty squares.  
"• Rank 7: ""5k2"" means five empty squares, then Black king on f7, then two empty squares.  "
"• Rank 6: ""p2pNqpr"" – this means:  "
  a6: Black pawn; b6 & c6: empty; d6: Black pawn; e6: White knight; f6: Black queen; g6: Black pawn; h6: Black rook.  
"• Rank 5: ""2pPp3"" – so:  "
"  a5, b5: empty; c5: Black pawn; d5: White pawn; e5: Black pawn; f5, g5, h5: empty.  "
"• Rank 4: ""2P1B3"" – meaning:  "
"  a4, b4: empty; c4: White pawn; d4: empty; e4: White bishop; f4, g4, h4: empty.  "
"• Rank 3: ""4P3"" – here:  "
  a3-d3: empty; e3: White pawn; f3-h3: empty.  
"• Rank 2: ""PP2K1R1"" – so:  "
"  a2: White pawn; b2: White pawn; c2, d2: empty; e2: White king; f2: empty; g2: White rook; h2: empty.  "
"• Rank 1: ""8"" – all empty."
"With this board in mind, we see that White’s knight on e6 is quite active, and the bishop on e4 (remember: White bishop is on e4, not e5—since the FEN on Rank 4 tells us that) is also well-placed. "
"Now, let’s move to the next step."
Step 2: Identify Candidate Moves  
"Based on these placements, we should now think about what candidate moves White might have. Consider factors like:"
" • Tactical threats (for example, is the knight in a position to attack the Black queen or create forks?)  "
 • Potential checks or forcing moves that might expose Black’s vulnerabilities.  
" • Coordination between White’s active pieces, such as the knight and bishop, against the Black king or queen."
"Please choose one candidate move for White from your analysis. Which move do you think might be promising from a tactical or strategic standpoint? Discuss your reasoning for why that move could be effective, and then share your candidate move (just the next step, not the final answer)."
"Student: Sure! Based on the analysis of the board and considering the positions of the pieces, I think a promising candidate move for White could be **Nf5** (moving the knight from e6 to f5)."
### Reasoning:
"1. **Attacking the Black Queen**: The knight on f5 directly attacks the Black queen on f6. This puts immediate pressure on Black, forcing them to respond to the threat."
"2. **Central Positioning**: The knight on f5 is well-placed, controlling important squares and remaining active. It can also potentially support other pieces in future moves."
"3. **Limiting Black's Options**: By moving to f5, White limits the mobility of Black's pieces, particularly the queen and the rook on g7. Black will need to react to the knight's threat, which may lead to further tactical opportunities for White."
"Overall, this move seems to create a strong tactical advantage for White and might lead to a favorable position. "
"So, my candidate move is **Nf5**. What do you think about this move? Would you like to explore other options or proceed with this one?"
"Teacher: Your reasoning about using the knight to create tactical pressure is on the right track. However, we need to verify whether the move you chose—Nf5—is a legal move from the knight’s position on e6."
"Remember, a knight moves in an ""L"" shape (two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular). Can you check which squares are actually reachable by the knight from e6? List those possible moves, and then consider which of them might create strong tactical opportunities (like attacking key enemy pieces or creating threats). Take your time and let me know what you come up with for the legal knight moves from e6 and a promising candidate move among them."
Student: Sure! Let's analyze the knight's potential moves from e6.
"The knight moves in an ""L"" shape, which means it can move:"
"- Two squares in one direction (horizontal or vertical) and then one square perpendicular to that direction, or"
- One square in one direction and then two squares perpendicular to that direction.
"From e6, the knight can move to the following squares:"
1. **c5** (two squares left and one down)
2. **c7** (two squares left and one up)
3. **d4** (one square left and two down)
4. **f4** (one square right and two down)
5. **f7** (one square right and two up)
6. **g5** (two squares right and one down)
7. **g7** (two squares right and one up)
"Now, let's evaluate these moves for their tactical potential:"
"- **c5**: Attacks the Black pawn on c6, but does not create immediate threats against more valuable pieces."
"- **c7**: This move puts pressure on the Black king, but it’s not as strong because it does not threaten any immediate captures."
"- **d4**: This move attacks the White pawn on d5, which is not beneficial for White."
"- **f4**: This move attacks the Black pawn on f5, but does not create immediate threats against Black's more valuable pieces."
"- **f7**: This move puts the knight in a position to attack the Black king, but it could be captured by the Black rook on g7."
"- **g5**: This move attacks the Black pawn on g6, but again does not threaten any more valuable pieces."
"- **g7**: This move attacks the Black rook on g7, which is a more significant piece."
"Among these options, the move **g7** stands out because it attacks the Black rook, forcing a response from Black and creating a tactical opportunity. "
"So, my revised candidate move is **Ng7** (moving the knight from e6 to g7). What do you think about this move? Would you like to discuss it further or proceed with it?"
"Teacher: You've done a good job listing the legal knight moves from e6. However, your candidate move Ng7 was chosen because you thought it attacked the Black rook—but on reviewing the board, g7 is an empty square and does not directly attack the rook or another high‐value piece."
Let's review the knight’s potential moves from e6:  
• c5  
• c7  
• d4  
• d8  
• f4  
• f8  
• g5  
• g7  
"Now, here's a guiding question: Which move among these would have the knight's new position directly attack the Black queen on f6? Remember, after the knight moves, consider which squares it then attacks based on the L‐shaped pattern. Analyze each candidate move and tell me which move will place the knight so that f6 falls within its attack pattern. What do you think?"
"Student: Thank you for your guidance! Let's analyze the knight's potential moves again from e6, focusing specifically on which moves would allow the knight to attack the Black queen on f6."
Here are the knight's legal moves from e6:
1. **c5**
2. **c7**
3. **d4**
4. **f4**
5. **f7**
6. **g5**
7. **g7**
"Now, let’s evaluate each move to see if any of them put the knight in a position to attack f6:"
- **c5**: This move does not attack f6.
- **c7**: This move does not attack f6.
- **d4**: This move does not attack f6.
- **f4**: This move does not attack f6.
- **f7**: This move does not attack f6.
- **g5**: This move does not attack f6.
- **g7**: This move does not attack f6.
"None of the moves directly put the knight on a square that attacks f6. However, I realize that my focus should be on the knight's ability to move to a square that can then attack the queen on f6 in the next turn."
"Looking at the moves again, the move **f4** does not directly attack f6, but it positions the knight close to the Black queen. If White can coordinate with the bishop on e5, it could create threats against the Black queen."
"Given that I misunderstood the attack on the queen, I need to reconsider the best candidate move. "
"After analyzing the possible knight moves and their implications, I believe moving the knight to **f4** is the most tactical move. It keeps pressure on the board and opens up possibilities for future attacks against the Black queen and other pieces."
"So, my candidate move is **Nf4** (moving the knight from e6 to f4). What do you think about this move? Would you like to discuss it further or proceed with it?"
"Teacher: Let's take a step back and re-examine our candidate moves for the knight from e6. You correctly listed the legal moves (although note that there are actually eight options: c5, c7, d4, d8, f4, f8, g5, and g7). As we looked through each of these moves, we wanted to see if any of them would immediately have the knight attacking the Black queen on f6. From your analysis, none of these moves seem to place the knight in a position where f6 is directly attacked."
"Before moving on to other pieces, I’d like you to double-check your thought process:  "
• What are the squares attacked by a knight from a given position?  
"• For example, from e6, if you consider the move Nf4, what are the squares the knight would then cover?  "
• And does any knight move from e6 directly target f6?  
"Take a moment to analyze these questions and verify if there is indeed no knight move that directly attacks f6, or if perhaps a different tactical idea should come from the knight moves. Let me know what you find regarding the knight moves and whether any of them create an immediate threat to the queen—or if another piece might need to be considered for immediate tactical pressure."
"Student: Sure! Let's carefully re-evaluate the knight's potential moves from e6, considering the squares that each move would cover and whether any of them directly threaten the Black queen on f6."
The knight's legal moves from e6 are:
1. **c5**
2. **c7**
3. **d4**
4. **f4**
5. **f7**
6. **g5**
7. **g7**
"Now, let’s analyze what each move would allow the knight to attack:"
"- **c5**: From c5, the knight would attack:"
"  - a4, a6, b3, b7, d3, d7, e6 (not directly attacking f6)."
"- **c7**: From c7, the knight would attack:"
"  - a6, b5, b7, d5, d8, e6 (not directly attacking f6)."
"- **d4**: From d4, the knight would attack:"
"  - b3, b5, c2, c6, e2, e6, f5, f3 (not directly attacking f6)."
"- **f4**: From f4, the knight would attack:"
"  - e2, e6, g2, g6, h3 (not directly attacking f6)."
"- **f7**: From f7, the knight would attack:"
"  - e5, e6, g5, g8 (not directly attacking f6)."
"- **g5**: From g5, the knight would attack:"
"  - e4, e6, f3, f7, h3, h7 (not directly attacking f6)."
"- **g7**: From g7, the knight would attack:"
"  - e6, f5, f8, h5, h8 (not directly attacking f6)."
"After analyzing all of the knight's moves, it is clear that none of them place the knight in a position to directly attack the Black queen on f6. "
"Given this, it seems that we need to explore other pieces or moves that can create threats against the Black queen or improve White's position. "
The bishop on e5 is well-placed and could potentially create pressure on the Black queen or other pieces. 
"Would you like me to explore a move for the bishop or another piece, or do you have a different idea in mind?"
"Teacher: You're doing a great job analyzing the knight's moves. Indeed, none of the knight moves from e6 seem to directly attack the Black queen on f6, so now it's a good moment to consider another piece that might create immediate tactical pressure. The bishop is a promising option."
"Step 3: Let's shift our focus to the bishop. From the FEN reconstruction, recall that White has a bishop on e4. Think about the moves available to that bishop. In particular, consider whether any bishop move can put immediate pressure on Black's queen or otherwise create strong tactical threats."
Could you describe a candidate move for the bishop and explain why that move might be effective? Remember to focus just on the next step without jumping to a full conclusion.
Student: Sure! Let's analyze the potential moves for the White bishop on e4.
"The bishop moves diagonally any number of squares, so from e4, the bishop can move to the following squares:"
1. **f5**
2. **g6**
3. **h7**
4. **d3**
5. **c2**
6. **b1**
7. **f3**
8. **d5**
"Now, let’s evaluate these moves for their tactical potential:"
"- **f5**: This move places the bishop on f5, where it does not directly attack the Black queen on f6 but controls the f6 square and could create threats against Black's position."
"- **g6**: This move places the bishop on g6, attacking the Black pawn on g7 but does not directly threaten the queen."
"- **h7**: This move places the bishop on h7, attacking the Black pawn on h7 but also does not threaten the queen."
"- **d3**: This move places the bishop on d3, where it does not create immediate threats."
"- **c2**: This move places the bishop on c2, where it does not create immediate threats."
"- **b1**: This move places the bishop on b1, where it does not create immediate threats."
"- **f3**: This move places the bishop on f3, where it does not create immediate threats."
"- **d5**: This move places the bishop on d5, where it attacks the Black pawn on d6. While it doesn't directly threaten the queen, it does put pressure on Black’s position."
"Among these options, the move **g6** stands out because it directly attacks the Black pawn on g7 and puts pressure on the Black rook on g7 as well. If the rook moves, the bishop on g6 would then have a potential line of attack against the Black queen on f6."
"So, my candidate move for the bishop is **Be4g6** (moving the bishop from e4 to g6). What do you think about this move? Would you like to discuss it further or proceed with it?"
"Teacher: Let's take a closer look at your candidate move Be4g6. Remember, our goal is to create immediate pressure on Black and win material or gain a decisive positional advantage."
"Before we evaluate the tactical consequences, let’s verify the move’s details: From square e4, moving the bishop diagonally to g6 means it will capture whatever resides on g6. According to the FEN, g6 is occupied by a Black pawn. So, our move would be a capture—Bishop takes on g6."
"Now, for our next step, please analyze the following:  "
• What immediate tactical consequences does capturing on g6 create?  
"• After Bishop takes on g6, what potential responses might Black have?  "
"• How could this move open lines or create threats (for example, against the Black queen on f6 or other key pieces)?"
Take your time to outline these consequences and detail your reasoning. What do you think happens after Be4g6?
Student: Sure! Let's analyze the consequences of the move **Bxe6** (Bishop takes on g6) and its tactical implications.
1. **Immediate Tactical Consequence**: 
"   - By capturing the Black pawn on g6, White not only removes a pawn from the board but also places the bishop on a strong square where it attacks the Black rook on g7. This creates immediate pressure on Black."
2. **Potential Responses from Black**: 
"   - After Bxe6, Black has a few possible responses:"
     - **Rook to g8**: The Black rook on g7 can move to g8 to protect the queen and potentially threaten the bishop.
"     - **Queen to f5**: The Black queen could move to f5, still maintaining its position but now in a more aggressive stance."
"     - **Rook to f7**: The Black rook could move to f7, protecting the queen and attacking the bishop."
"     - **Queen takes on g6**: If Black chooses to capture the bishop with the queen, it would remove the immediate threat but allow White to gain material back in the following moves."
3. **Opening Lines and Creating Threats**:
"   - By capturing on g6, White opens up the g-file. If the Black rook moves away from g7, it allows the White rook on f2 to potentially swing over to g2 or g3, creating further threats against Black."
"   - The bishop on g6 also controls the f7 square, which might be useful in future tactical operations against the Black king."
"   - Additionally, this move could lead to potential forks or tactical motifs involving the knight and rook. If the Black rook moves, the knight on e6 can also create threats against the queen or other pieces."
"Overall, the move **Bxe6** seems to create a strong tactical position for White, putting pressure on Black and forcing them to respond to the threats. "
"So, my conclusion is that **Bxe6** is a strong candidate move. What do you think about this analysis? Should we proceed with this move, or would you like to explore other options?"
"Teacher: Let's take a moment to clarify and re-examine your analysis. I noticed that in your explanation you referred to the move as Bxe6, but our candidate bishop move from e4 was to go to g6—so it should be notated as Bxg6. (Remember, the piece on g6 that the bishop would capture is a Black pawn, as per the FEN.)"
"Now, let’s focus on the move Bxg6 (bishop on e4 capturing the pawn on g6). For the next step, please analyze the following:"
• What immediate tactical or material consequences does capturing on g6 have for White?  
"• What possible replies could Black have after Bxg6, and what threats might those replies create or lose?  "
• How might this capture affect the coordination among Black’s pieces (especially concerning the Black queen on f6 or the Black rook on g7)?  
Take your time to reframe your reasoning considering the correct move (Bxg6) and share your analysis of the consequences after that capture.
Student: Sure! Let's analyze the move **Bxg6** (the bishop on e4 capturing the Black pawn on g6) and its implications.
1. **Immediate Tactical Consequences**:
"   - By capturing the Black pawn on g6, White not only removes a pawn but also places the bishop on a strong square where it threatens the Black rook on g7. This puts pressure on Black to respond to the threat against the rook."
2. **Potential Responses from Black**:
"   - After **Bxg6**, Black has a few possible responses:"
     - **Rook to g8**: The Black rook can move to g8 to protect the queen on f6 and potentially threaten the bishop.
"     - **Queen takes g6**: The Black queen could capture the bishop on g6, which would remove the threat to the rook and regain material."
"     - **Rook to f7**: The Black rook could move to f7, defending the queen and attacking the bishop, but it would still leave the queen vulnerable."
"     - **Rook to h7**: This would also protect the rook on g7 and potentially threaten the White king, but it does not directly deal with the threat to the queen."
3. **Opening Lines and Creating Threats**:
"   - Capturing on g6 opens up the g-file, which could be advantageous for White's rook on f2 to later swing over to g2 or g3, creating threats against Black."
"   - The bishop on g6 controls the f7 square, which could be useful in future tactical operations against the Black king."
"   - If Black responds with **Qxg6**, it would allow White to potentially create counter-threats with the knight on e6 or the rook on f2, depending on how Black positions their pieces afterward."
"Overall, the move **Bxg6** creates a strong tactical position for White, putting immediate pressure on Black and forcing them to react to the threats against their rook and the potential for further attacks on the queen."
"So, my conclusion is that **Bxg6** is a strong candidate move. What do you think about this analysis? Should we proceed with this move, or would you like to explore other options?"
"Teacher: Great work analyzing Bxg6 and its consequences! You've clearly identified that after Bxg6, White puts pressure on Black’s rook on g7 and opens potential lines of attack. "
"Now, for the next step, let's dive a bit deeper into the tactical consequences: "
"Please consider this follow-up question: If Black responds to Bxg6 by capturing with Qxg6, what immediate issues would that create for Black? How might White continue to build pressure or create further tactical threats in that line? "
Take your time and share your analysis for the position that would follow after Qxg6.
Student: Sure! Let’s analyze the position after **Bxg6** if Black responds with **Qxg6** (the Black queen capturing the bishop on g6).
1. **Immediate Issues for Black**:
"   - After **Qxg6**, the Black queen captures a piece but exposes itself to potential threats from White's knight on e6. The knight can move to f4, attacking the Black queen on g6 and maintaining pressure on Black's position."
"   - The Black rook on g7 is still under threat from the knight, which could create tactical opportunities for White to win material if Black does not respond carefully."
2. **Potential Tactical Follow-ups for White**:
"   - If White plays **Nf4** after **Qxg6**, the knight attacks the Black queen, forcing it to move again. This could lead to a situation where White gains tempo by attacking the queen while simultaneously maintaining pressure on Black's pieces."
"   - After **Nf4**, if the Black queen moves to a square like f5 or h5, White could then consider moves like **Rook to g2**, increasing pressure on the g-file, or even moves like **Nxe6**, capturing the Black rook on g7 if the knight on f4 is allowed to advance."
3. **Coordination Among Black’s Pieces**:
"   - The move **Qxg6** does not effectively resolve the threats against Black's position. The Black rook on g7 remains vulnerable, and the Black king is still exposed."
"   - White’s pieces (the knight on e6, the rook on f2, and the potential for the rook to swing to the g-file) can work together to create threats against the Black king, queen, and rook."
"Overall, if Black responds with **Qxg6**, it creates immediate tactical problems for them. White can capitalize on the position by attacking the queen and maintaining pressure on Black's remaining pieces, potentially leading to a favorable outcome for White."
"In summary, I believe that after **Bxg6**, if Black plays **Qxg6**, White has strong follow-up moves that can continue to build pressure and threaten Black’s position. Would you like to proceed with the original move **Bxg6**, or do you want to explore other options?"
"Teacher: Excellent analysis on the consequences of Qxg6 following Bxg6. You've identified that if Black recaptures with Qxg6, the queen becomes exposed to moves like Nf4, which can create further pressure. Also, you've shown that Black's coordination might suffer as the rook on g7 remains under threat, and White’s pieces can potentially coordinate quickly to exploit these weaknesses."
"Before we proceed, let’s review our discussion:"
" • We first examined the knight moves from e6, and saw none directly attacked the Black queen."
" • Then, we shifted focus to the bishop on e4 and analyzed the candidate move Bxg6."
" • You pointed out that after Bxg6, if Black replies with Qxg6, White can exploit this with moves like Nf4 that attack the queen and maintain pressure on Black’s position."
"Now, for the next step, please decide: Based on your analysis, do you think Bxg6 is the best move for White, or should we continue exploring another candidate move? If you continue with Bxg6, explain how you would follow up after Black’s likely response of Qxg6. "
Please share your reasoning for your candidate move and how you plan to build on the tactical threats after the recapture. Let's focus just on this next step.
"Student: Based on the thorough analysis we've conducted, I believe that **Bxg6** is indeed the best move for White. This move not only captures a pawn but also places the bishop in a strong position, directly threatening the Black rook on g7 and creating immediate tactical pressure on Black's position."
### Follow-Up After **Bxg6**:
"If Black responds with **Qxg6** (capturing the bishop), White can then play **Nf4**. This move has several key benefits:"
"1. **Attacking the Black Queen**: The knight on f4 directly attacks the Black queen on g6, forcing it to move again. This gives White a tempo advantage and allows White to dictate the flow of the game."
"2. **Maintaining Pressure on Black**: After Nf4, Black has to respond to the threat against the queen. The queen may move to a square like f5 or h5, but in either case, White will be able to further build pressure."
"3. **Coordination of White's Pieces**: The knight on f4, along with the rook on f2, can create additional threats against Black's position. For example, if the Black queen moves to f5, White could play Rg2, increasing pressure on the g-file and threatening the rook on g7."
"4. **Potential for Material Gain**: If Black is not careful, White could potentially capture the Black rook on g7 with Nxe6, gaining material and further weakening Black's position."
"Overall, the move **Bxg6** opens up tactical opportunities for White, and the follow-up with **Nf4** maximizes the pressure on Black’s position. "
"So, I will proceed with the move **Bxg6**. After that, if Black responds with **Qxg6**, I will follow up with **Nf4** to continue applying pressure. Thank you for your guidance throughout this analysis!"
Teacher: Great work! You've carefully considered the tactical implications of Bxg6 and thoughtfully planned the follow‐up with Nf4 if Black recaptures with Qxg6.
To summarize the key points:
• You identified that the knight’s moves from e6 do not immediately threaten the Black queen.
• You then examined the bishop on e4 and saw that moving it to g6 to capture the Black pawn not only wins material but also increases pressure by attacking the Black rook on g7.
"• You analyzed Black’s potential response (Qxg6) and realized that after Nf4, the Black queen would be attacked and forced to move, giving White a significant tempo advantage and enhancing coordination among White's pieces."
"Based on your analysis, you decided that Bxg6 is the strongest move for White."
"Since you’re ready to commit to your candidate move, please provide the move in the specified format (source square followed by destination square, e.g., ""f8f4""). What is your final move?"
Student: My final move is **Bxe6** (the bishop on e4 captures the Black pawn on g6).
"Teacher: It looks like there’s a bit of confusion: our candidate move was to move the bishop from e4 to g6 (capturing on g6), which in the required format is written as e4g6. Please revise your final move accordingly."
"When you're ready, provide the move in the correct format."
Student: My final move is **e4g6** (the bishop on e4 captures the Black pawn on g6).
Teacher: Your final move is: e4g6$
