Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'r3r1k1/pp5p/n3q3/3B1QP1/2p5/7P/PP6/2K2n2 w - - 2 35'. 
"What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The winning move is d5e6. 
"To explain briefly: by moving the bishop from d5 to e6 you capture Black’s queen with check. Black’s only recapture is Rxe6, and regardless of the response Black loses decisive material as you exchange a bishop for the queen. This tactical shot leads to a winning advantage for White."
