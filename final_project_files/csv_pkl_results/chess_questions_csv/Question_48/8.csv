Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '2r2r1k/p5p1/4Q2p/3pBn2/3P4/8/P5PP/2R4K b - - 0 29'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
"3o-mini: The winning idea is to simply grab white’s loose rook with the c8–rook. In the diagram the white rook sits unguarded on c1, so Black’s best move is to capture it."
The answer is: c8c1
