Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '2r2r1k/p5p1/4Q2p/3pBn2/3P4/8/P5PP/2R4K b - - 0 29'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The move is c8c1. 
To explain briefly without revealing every calculation detail: Black can trade a rook for Whiteâ€™s rook on c1 by playing the move from c8 to c1. This is tactically very strong in the given position and leads to decisive advantages in the ensuing complications.
