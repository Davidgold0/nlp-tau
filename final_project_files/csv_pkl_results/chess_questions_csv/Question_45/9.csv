Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '1k5r/ppp2p1R/8/8/4q1P1/P7/1P2P3/K2Q1B2 b - - 1 25'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
"3o-mini: The winning move is for Black’s queen to capture the white rook on h7. In other words, the best move is:"
e4h7
"Let’s briefly explain: Black’s queen on e4 may travel diagonally (via f5, g6) to h7 to capture the white rook sitting there. Since that diagonal is clear and the white rook on h7 is undefended, this capture wins significant material and leaves White short‐handed."
Thus the best move for Black is e4h7.
