Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'r3r1k1/pp5p/n3B3/5QP1/2p5/7P/PP6/2K2n2 b - - 0 35'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
"3o-mini: The winning idea for Black is to activate the knight on f1 by playing 35...Nf1e3. This move immediately attacks White’s queen on f5. If the queen leaves the important a8–h1 (or a2–h7) diagonal that defends the loose bishop on e6, Black will be able to capture that bishop with the rook (via …Rxe6), gaining decisive material. In many variations, White cannot find a square that both saves the queen and keeps the bishop defended, so Black ends up winning material."
Thus the best move for Black is:
f1e3
