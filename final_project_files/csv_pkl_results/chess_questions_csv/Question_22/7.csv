Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'r3r1k1/pp5p/n3B3/5QP1/2p5/7P/PP6/2K2n2 b - - 0 35'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The move is f1e3. 
"To explain briefly without revealing all internal computations: Black’s knight on f1 can jump to e3, which immediately attacks White’s queen on f5. With this forcing tactical move – and in a position where Black is already materially ahead – the threat puts White in a difficult bind. Detailed analysis shows that f1e3 is by far the strongest move, setting in motion decisive threats that force White into an unfavorable position."
