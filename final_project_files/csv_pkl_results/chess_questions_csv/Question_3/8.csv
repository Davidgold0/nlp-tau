Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '8/5p2/5p1p/Pp6/4k3/7P/6PK/8 w - - 0 44'. 
"What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The best move is a5a6. 
"Let's briefly explain the idea. In the given position the critical resource for White is the a‐pawn. Although Black has an extra pawn overall, the white a–pawn is well advanced and if pushed immediately becomes a dangerous passed pawn. After 1.a5–a6, Black can’t capture it with the pawn on b5 (since Black’s pawns move “down‐the board” and b5 doesn’t control a6) and the Black king simply cannot reach a6 in time to stop its advance. White’s plan is to push a7 followed by promotion on a8. With accurate play on both sides, this breakthrough tips the balance in White’s favor."
"Thus, the best move for White in the notation requested is:"
a5a6
