Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '2r2r1k/p5p1/2R1Q2p/3pBn2/3P4/8/P5PP/2q4K w - - 0 29'. 
"What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The winning move is c6c1. 
"Explanation: With the rook on c6, White can clear the full c‐file by capturing the black queen on c1. There are no obstructions between c6 and c1, and none of Black’s pieces (including the rook on c8) can interpose before the capture is made. Even if Black recaptures following the exchange, White emerges with a decisive material advantage."
"Thus, the best move is: c6c1."
