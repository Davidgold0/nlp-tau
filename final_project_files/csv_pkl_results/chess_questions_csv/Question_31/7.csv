Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '2r2r1k/p5p1/2R1Q2p/3pBn2/3P4/8/P5PP/2q4K w - - 0 29'. 
"What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
"3o-mini: The winning move is to capture Black’s queen with the rook. In other words, play"
  c6c1
"This move uses the rook on c6 traveling down the open c–file (passing through c5, c4, c3 and c2, all empty) to take the enemy queen sitting on c1. By removing Black’s queen, White both parries Black’s imminent back‐rank mate threat (via ...Qh1#) and seizes a massive material advantage."
