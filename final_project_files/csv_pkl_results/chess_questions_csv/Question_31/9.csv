Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '2r2r1k/p5p1/2R1Q2p/3pBn2/3P4/8/P5PP/2q4K w - - 0 29'. 
"What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The winning move is e6g4.
"Here’s the idea in brief. In the given position White’s queen on e6 is already ideally placed. By playing e6g4, the queen hops diagonally to g4. From g4 the queen eyes two targets along the NW‐diagonal – the black knight on f5 and, further along, the black rook on c8. (In this line the white queen’s “fork” is possible because, thanks to the white rook on c6 blocking the black queen’s defense of the c8–rook, the rook on c8 isn’t really guarded.) Black must choose which piece to save, and regardless of the answer White wins material."
"Thus, the correct move for White is: e6g4."
