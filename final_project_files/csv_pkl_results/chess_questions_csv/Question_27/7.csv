Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '6k1/6pn/Q6p/1p2R3/8/5r2/1q3PPP/6K1 w - - 0 27'. 
"What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The winning move is a6h6. 
"To explain briefly without revealing all internal details: by moving the queen from a6 to h6 and capturing the pawn on h6, White sets up an unstoppable mate threat (namely Qxg7#). Blackâ€™s defenders have no satisfactory way to cover g7 or parry the mate threat, and eventually mate is forced. "
"Thus, the best move for White is: a6h6."
