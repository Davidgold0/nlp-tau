Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '6k1/6pn/Q6p/1p2R3/8/5r2/1q3PPP/6K1 w - - 0 27'. 
"What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The winning move is  e5e8. 
"To explain briefly without revealing the full tree: By playing 27.Re8+ you force Black’s king into a situation where any reply immediately leads to mate. In the key variations the rook on e8 works in tandem with the queen on a6 (plus Black’s own cramped pieces) so that if Black’s king steps to h8, then a quiet rook swing to h8 is mate, while if Black tries other king moves the mating net is equally decisive. "
"Thus, the best move for White is  e5e8."
