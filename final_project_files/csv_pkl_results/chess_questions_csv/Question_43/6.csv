Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '1r2r1k1/5pp1/p6Q/2p5/4p3/1P4P1/P1P2PP1/4R1K1 b - - 0 31'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The correct move is e8f8. 
"I'll now explain briefly (without giving full engine details) why this is best. In the position the white queen on h6 and rook on e1 are poised to launch a deadly attack – white is threatening mate (for example via a Qh8+ idea) that Black must parry immediately. By playing Rf8 (moving the rook from e8 to f8) Black covers key mating‐squares and convinces White that the immediate mate threats have been defused. Although Black remains in a difficult position, this resourceful defensive move is the only move that keeps fighting."
"Thus, the answer is:"
e8f8
