Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '5rk1/6pn/Q6p/1p2R3/8/5N2/1q3PPP/6K1 b - - 0 26'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The winning idea is to deflect the white king with a queen sacrifice. Black’s correct and decisive move is
  b2f2
Here’s a brief outline of the idea:
1. …Qxf2+ forces the white king to go to h1 (since Kxf2 is illegal–the rook on f8 covers f2 and f1 is ruled out by the rook as well).
"2. Then after 27.Kh1, Black can follow up with a force‐mating continuation (for example, Qf1+ followed by Qg1# in one of the variations)."
"Thus, Black’s best move is b2f2."
