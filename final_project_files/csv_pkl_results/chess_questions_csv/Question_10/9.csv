Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '5rk1/6pn/Q6p/1p2R3/8/5N2/1q3PPP/6K1 b - - 0 26'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The winning tactic is to capture the loose knight. Black can play
  f8f3
"since the rook on f8 flies down the f–file to capture the unguarded knight on f3, winning material."
