Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'r1b2r1k/pp1p1pBp/4p3/2p1nP2/2P1P3/1P4R1/P5PP/7K b - - 5 21'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
"3o-mini: The move that meets all of Black’s needs is to activate the knight while protecting the f8‐rook, namely:"
  e5g6
"Here’s the idea in brief: the white bishop on g7 is currently eyeing the rook on f8 (since g7’s northwest diagonal directly hits f8). Instead of passively moving the rook, Black may play 21...Ng6 to relocate the knight from e5 to g6. This does two things at once. First, it now defends f8 so that if White is tempted to capture the rook (Bxf8), Black can recapture with Nxf8 without losing material. Second, it puts the knight on an active square, where it may later head to f4 or otherwise participate in central and kingside play."
"Thus, the best move for Black is:"
  e5g6
