Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '1r2r1k1/5pp1/p6Q/2p1q3/4p3/1P4R1/P1P2PPP/4R1K1 b - - 2 30'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: e5f4
"Let's explain briefly. In the position, Black’s queen on e5 can go to f4 along the diagonal. On f4 it simultaneously eyes the white queen sitting on h6 (since f4–g5–h6 is a clear diagonal) and creates a deadly mate threat on f2 (since the queen on f4 controls the f–file, and with f3 clear Qxf2 would be mate). White cannot adequately protect f2 while also parrying the attack on the queen. Hence 30...Qf4 turns out to be Black’s strongest resource."
