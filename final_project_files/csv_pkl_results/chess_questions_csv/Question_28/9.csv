Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): '1k5r/ppp2p1R/8/8/4q1P1/P7/1P2P3/1K1Q1B2 w - - 0 25'. 
"What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The winning move is 25.Qd5. 
"To explain briefly without revealing all engine details: by moving the queen from d1 to d5 you set up an unavoidable mate threatâ€”in particular, you threaten Rxh8#, and Black has no resource (no interposing move or timely king escape) to stop the mate. Thus 25.Qd5 is the best move for White."
"So, the answer in the required notation is: d1d5."
