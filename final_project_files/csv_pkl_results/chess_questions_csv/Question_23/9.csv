Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'rn1qkbnr/1pp2Bpp/3p4/p3N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BbK2R b KQkq - 0 6'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: I'll recommend d6e5.
"After reconstructing the board carefully from the FEN, note that Black’s pawn on d6 can capture the white knight on e5. The white knight on e5 isn’t defended by any of White’s pieces, so the move"
  d6e5
"wins material. (Later, even if White recaptures by moving the knight from c3 to d1 to pick up the black bishop sitting awkwardly on d1, Black will recapture with the queen and the resulting exchanges favor Black’s position.) "
"Thus, the best move for Black is: d6e5."
