Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'rn1qkbnr/1pp2Bpp/3p4/p3N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BbK2R b KQkq - 0 6'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
"3o-mini: The critical tactical issue is that white threatens a devastating fork with Ne5–d7, which would attack both black’s king on e8 and the unprotected bishop sitting on d1. To prevent the fork and defend the bishop, the best move is to cover the d7‐square. This is best done by developing the queenside knight to d7."
Answer: b8d7
