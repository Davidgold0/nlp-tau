Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'rn1qkbnr/1pp2ppp/3p4/p3N3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BbK2R w KQkq - 0 6'. 
"What is the best move for white? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The move is c3d5. 
"Let me briefly explain the tactical ideas behind it. White’s knight on c3 can leap into d5, where it creates an immediate threat of going to c7 with a fork (attacking the rook on a8 and the king on e8). Because of that threat, Black must respond very carefully – and in many lines, this tactic leaves Black scrambling to cover the c7‐square while White’s pieces remain ideally placed to create further problems."
"Thus, the engine’s analysis shows that 1. Nd5 (written in coordinate notation as c3d5) is the best move for White."
