Question: You are a very strong chess engine.
The chess board is in the following state (FEN): 'R4bk1/3prp1p/1Q6/1pP2ppN/3P4/4P1P1/5PKP/1q6 b - - 3 30'. 
"What is the best move for black? Respond with a single move in the following notation: [source square][destination square] (e.g., ""f8f4"")."
3o-mini: The move that gives Black the strongest counter‐play is b1d3. 
"To explain briefly without giving away all the engine details: Black’s queen departs from its passive post on b1 and goes centrally to d3. From there the queen not only eyes key central and queenside squares but also creates tactical pressure that in many variations forces White into unfavorable exchanges or loss of material. This active counter‐attack is the critical resource that turns the tables—even though the material is roughly even, Black’s pieces become well‑coordinated after …Qd3."
So the best move is: b1d3.
